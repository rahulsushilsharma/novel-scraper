Apparently I Grew Wings
“Hmmm…”I twisted and turned the mirror I had on hand, dexterously manipulating it in order to check myself out. I slowly examined every last nook and cranny, with my expression remaining serious throughout the process.For the most part, I looked no different from usual. My hair was black, and my facial features were all exactly as I remembered them. To be honest, I was just another guy. I wasn’t especially handsome nor particularly ugly. My eyes carried a bit of a sharp glint, but they were honestly the only part of my face that didn’t scream average. My height and build both fell within the norm as well.The reason I was scrutinizing myself wasn’t because I was some sort of narcissist. I wasn’t particularly interested in taking in the appeal of my own body. I was merely checking myself over because it was absolutely necessary.I gave the mirror yet another twist and started to gaze at my back: the most abnormal part of me. For some odd reason, I’d grown wings. The pitch black protrusions sprouted out of the area around my shoulder blade. They looked like the kind of thing you’d expect to see on a dragon, or maybe even a bat. I couldn’t tell which.Having wings was weird. I’d never had them before, so they almost didn’t feel like a part of my body despite clearly being attached to me. It was a bit difficult for me to control them due to my unfamiliarity with them, but focusing on them allowed me to flap them, thereby confirming that they weren’t just some sort of decoration.The second and only other weird part of my body was my right eye. My eyes were both originally black. Keyword: were. My right iris, however, had gone through some sort of change. It had somehow dyed itself a brilliant shade of crimson.It seemed that the change in colour was linked to one of the skills innate to my race. Specifically, it was one of the so called “magic eyes,” the cringy things Japanese kids in middle school loved going on and on about. I myself had gone through a similar phase in the past, so seeing the piercing red eyeball had caused a series of embarrassing memories to resurface. I immediately started feeling ashamed of myself.Though my body had changed, my clothes hadn’t. I was still wearing jeans and a t-shirt. The overly casual apparel starkly contrasted my less than normal body parts. My appearance was all over the place; I felt like a shitty, low budget cosplayer.Wait a second. I’m wearing a t-shirt over my wings? Oh god damn it, it’s probably torn, isn’t it?I couldn’t quite get the angle I needed to see the supposedly torn part of my shirt, but I remained absolutely certain that it’d suffered damage nonetheless.“You know what? Screw this. I’m going to bed.”The act of examining my body had caused me far more mental fatigue than I was comfortable with, so I decided to just stop thinking about it. I used a bunch of dungeon points, or DP for short, and purchased a futon, a japanese style bed.I appeared to be in some sort of throne room, but I decided to just flat out ignore it for the time being. I laid the futon out on the floor, tucked myself in, and closed my eyes.***General Information

Getting a Grasp of the Status Quo

So what exactly happened?The answer to that question was surprisingly simple: I reincarnated.My death was a boring one. It wasn’t accompanied by any extenuating circumstances. I wasn’t involved in any sort of major incident, nor was I intentionally killed for any particular reason. I simply died in just another everyday accident. And then I was reborn.I never met any sort of God. I wasn’t informed that I’d been killed. But I was certain that I’d died. The sensation was still vividly ingrained in my mind. I could still recall the feeling of the truck crushing my bones and mutilating my body beyond repair. I could still feel the blood and pain simultaneously seep from my body as my consciousness slowly sank into the abyss.A shiver ran up my spine as I recalled it. It was far too explicit a memory for it to be fake. I really had died. Taking a deep breath, I calmed my nerves and stopped myself from trembling. I chased the unpleasant memories out of my mind and set them aside. No good was going to come out of dwelling on the past.When I came to, I found myself in what could only be described as a throne room, one filled with expensive looking chandeliers, walls, and pillars. There weren’t any windows, and it honestly seemed quite small for what it was. Behind me sat a single throne. It wasn’t overly decorated or particularly gaudy in any which way. Rather, it gave off a sense of majesty. A large blue carpet ran from one end of the room to the other. I followed it with my eyes as I observed the room in its entirety. There were very few ornaments placed within. The only expensive looking thing was the door that lay at the end of the hall.All in all, the room gave off a sort of sinister feel. It looked like the kind of area that would likely be accompanied by a demon lord or some other sort of final boss, with the only difference being that it seemed a bit small.My mind was blown. I couldn’t help but blankly stare as I slowly took in my surroundings. It took a good while for me to finally recover and realize that I needed to get a better grasp of my current situation.I stood up. And as I did, my line of sight changed.“The heck is that?”I immediately spotted a rainbow coloured gem as I got to my feet. It was situated right behind the throne, and seemed to be be radiating a colourful light. The gem was circular, and seemed to be just a bit smaller than a basketball.For some odd reason, I decided to reach out and touch it. I had no idea why I made the decision, but I did.“What theaaaaaaaaaarrggh!?”A head splitting pain assaulted my mind the moment my fingers touched the orb. It was like my brain was being tampered with against my will. Unpleasant, unnatural sensations coursed through my body as I fell on my hands and knees. Tears began to spill from the corners of my eyes.All I felt was pain. It hurt so bad I couldn’t see straight; the world had started rocking back and forth, tilting left and right. I felt nauseous, I almost wanted to vomit.The hellish headache persisted at full strength for several seconds before slowly beginning to abate. It came and went in waves, fluctuating in intensity every few moments.“I…see…”I managed to squeeze out a few words between rapid, shallow breaths. I felt as if I’d suddenly been injected with knowledge, as if a dictionary had implanted itself inside my brain.And that was exactly what had happened.“Menu.”I recited one of the words the dungeon itself had taught me. A translucent, glass-like pane appeared in midair, materializing itself right in front of me. The knowledge I’d suddenly gained informed me that the menu I summoned was adaptable. Its appearance would change based on its beholder; it would morph in such a way that it always appeared as intuitive as possible. I used to be an avid consumer of video games, and for that reason, the dungeon seemed to have judged the that its menu should appear like that of a game’s.If I was a goblin, it probably would have manifested as something along the lines of a stone slate instead, given how primitive they were.I still felt a bit dizzy, so I placed a hand against my forehead to prevent the world from staggering as I looked down at the menu options. It seemed to have four buttons: Status, DP Catalogue, Dungeon, and Gacha. [1]The last of the four immediately grabbed my attention. Rolling a gacha and trying my luck sounded tempting, really tempting. That said, I understood it wasn’t a good idea for me to try it without first obtaining a more robust understanding of my current situation.For the time being, I decided to start off by checking out my stats. I manipulated the menu by tapping it, as I would a smartphone or other touch device.“Wait… I’m an archdemon?”Well, so much for being human…[1] I didn’t localize this term because I feel that it’s already used enough in English. If anything, localizing it would make less sense. Anyway, for those that don’t know what these are, they’re machines with capsules inside of them. The capsules contain toys, and you never know what you’re going to get until you insert your money and give the thing a spin, but the prizes are sometimes listed somewhere if you look for them. They are commonly used in video games, particularly MMOs and asian mobile games, and typically function as a premium feature for paying users.

Demon Lord from Another WorldDP: 1000***I blinked a few times in surprise as I continued looking over my status page. I’d apparently not only lost my humanity, but also became a Demon Lord. Confusion coursed through my mind, but only for a moment. The w*kipedia-like database implanted in my head promptly answered all my concerns and informed me that a Demon Lord was in fact not an evil ruler that propagated a doctrine of violence and conquest, but rather just a term used to describe an individual in charge of a dungeon. For all intents and purposes, demon lord and dungeon master were synonymous.My name was Yuki. It was basically the exact same as the name I used to have prior to my death, save for the fact that it was written in katakana as opposed to kanji. [1] The loss of the kanji that denoted my first name made it feel even more girly than it already had. [2] That said, my first name was faring better than my last name, which’d flat out been deleted.I didn’t really have anything to compare my stats to, so I couldn’t really gauge how good they were. But in any case, my luck looked ridiculously low, which did make sense given the accidental nature of my death. What I couldn’t make sense of was my dexterity. I didn’t ever do anything that required me to develop precision or finesse. I was never into the arts.After I was done checking out my stats, I moved on and started examining my skills. I swiped my finger across each item in turn in order to get a better grasp of my own abilities.Of the four I had, three were pretty intuitive given their names. Analyze allowed me to inspect something and determine its stats. Leveling it up would increase the level of detail displayed. Item Box allowed me to store items in a dimensional rift whose size was relative to my max MP. Translation allowed me to remain both conversational and literate even though I’d been whisked away to another world. My last and least intuitive skill, magic eye, was innate to my race. Apparently, it allowed me to see magical power. I couldn’t actually tell whether or not it was of any use. As far as I was concerned, magic was still pretty much a foreign concept.Each skill had a level associated with it, ranging from one to ten. Skill points could be used to bolster skill levels, with higher leveled skills requiring more points.The second last part of my status page was a section containing titles. At the moment, I had just one, Demon Lord from Another World. It’s description read as follows: A title granted to an individual originating from outside this world. Those that bear this title will automatically obtain the translation skill.“I guess that doubles down and confirms that this really is another world…” I muttered.I was done looking through my stat page, so I dismissed it and tapped the DP Catalogue button. The menu switched to another screen, one displaying a list of items. Each was accompanied by a number, their cost in DP. The list contained all the typical things you’d expect to see in a fantasy-based JRPG: swords, shields, staves, armour, and the whole shebang. But that wasn’t all. It also contained a wide variety of non-fantastical items. I could choose to purchase cups, toothbrushes, food, and all my other everyday necessities as well. There were even consoles and games, but their prices were exorbitant and way beyond what I could afford.The DP Catalogue, as a whole, seemed really convenient. It looked like my purchases would get delivered to me the moment I made the exchange.Browsing the catalogue kind of reminds me of online shopping. The whole system feels kinda out of place given the fantasy-esque setting, but hey, it’s convenient, so I’m not complaining.All in all, it seemed like there were two different types of items. There were the items from this world, which, in general, tended to be less expensive, and the items from my world, which were precisely the opposite. It was almost as if the latter group of items were only present and purchasable because I knew they existed. They seemed too inconsistent and out of place to be there for any other reason.The third function I checked was the gacha function. It seemed that I could choose between four different gachas, with their prices being: 100 DP, 1000 DP, 10000DP, and 100000 DP respectively. There didn’t seem to be a list of prizes anywhere. I’d have to go in blind if I wanted to try my luck.The final menu button, the “Dungeon” button, took me to a page that had a ton of options pertaining to the dungeon’s core functions. It allowed me to add to the number of floors, increase the size of the dungeon’s domain, summon monsters, and much more. There was far too much information for me to take it all in at once, so I decided to refrain from checking out the details for the time being.It seemed that the dungeon itself was a living thing, a species of organism often born in places with a high concentration of magical particles. Like many other organisms, dungeons were born weak and frail. They were incredible easy to destroy early on in their infancy.Humans were particularly well known for their dungeon-crushing antics. Their attacks were heavily driven by greed. Or at least what I assumed to be greed. The dungeon’s core, the rainbow-like orb that served as its heart, looked like it could fetch a pretty penny on the market.Unfortunately, humans weren’t the only creatures that attacked dungeons. Monsters, members of this world’s wildlife, did as well. Dungeon cores were rich in mana, and thus, the monsters’ instincts drove them to hunt them.In other words, dungeons had enemies on all sides.Everyone and everything was hostile.And it was for that reason that dungeons summoned demon lords, guardians that could protect them from the harsh environments in which they were born. Dungeons concentrated their magical energies in their demon lords and allowed them to become much more powerful than ever before. In exchange, the demon lords protected the dungeons and bolstered their chances of survival.It was a picture perfect example of a symbiotic relationship.Most dungeons obtained their demon lords by drawing in nearby monsters and rebirthing them. My dungeon, however, had been born in an area with an abnormally high concentration of magical particles. It was much more powerful than its peers. It invested nearly all of its energy into summoning a being more suited to the role: me. It’d selected me even though I’d already died in another world and become nothing more than just a soul.Wait, that means the dungeon thinks that I’m much more suited to being a demon lord than all the other candidates it came across? The hell!? Makes me think I’m evil incarnate or something. Feels bad man.My race had been altered because the dungeon believed that I would be able to do my job better as an archdemon. The change had only been made possible by my soul’s affinities. I was apparently just innately suited to being an archdemon.Uh… Alright, let’s chalk that up to the fact that I used to play an archdemon in that one MMO I really liked.  … Okay, yeah no. That’s total bullshit and I know it.I sighed. I didn’t quite feel like contemplating my own moral alignment, so I let my mind wander. The first thing it latched back onto was my stats. To reiterate, I had no idea how powerful I was relative to everything else. The world I’d been reincarnated in was filled with violence. It lacked the peace that my old world had basically bathed in. Monsters roamed the land, fighting and killing for the sake of self preservation. Wars and other armed conflicts were the norm. Surviving was going to be tough if I was too weak.After another moment’s worth of contemplation, I turned my gaze towards the dungeon core.It and I had become two parts of a whole. It played a heavy hand in maintaining the vessel that functioned as my body. If it were to be destroyed, then I was sure to follow. And because I’d become both the owner and manager of most of its resources, it too would weaken, dwindle away, and die if I were to lose my life.Neither the dungeon nor I could survive without the other.It’d become my second heart, and I’d become its second body.Though I did resent it for summoning me into a world completely filled with barbaric brutality, I was still plenty grateful that it’d given me a second shot at life.I decided that I would live it out however I wanted, enjoying my days as they passed, that I wouldn’t waste the opportunity I’d been granted.And that, for my own sake, I would protect the dungeon’s core.It’d given me another chance. Defending it was well worth my time.I let a bit of a smile show up on my face as I used a bit of DP to purchase a mirror. I needed to check myself over so I could evaluate precisely what becoming an archdemon had entailed.***[1] Katakana is the Japanese alphabet normally used for when you’re just trying to sound out a word. It is seen most commonly when Japanese people try to use foreign words in text. Kanji is Chinese hanzi characters used in a Japanese context. While it’s possible to guess some of their pronounciations based off precedent, it’s much, much more difficult if not often impossible.[2] Yuki is typically a girl’s name. The old spelling of his name was likely something that had manly kanji in it. Note that Yuki is different from Yuuki, which is typically a boy’s name.<– Prev — Next –>

Getting a Grasp of the Status Quo — Part 3The night came and went. It was morning. I’d woken up to a fresh new day with my head clear of all the confusion that’d come with my reincarnation. I promptly made my bed and activated Item Box. A sizable rift in space appeared right in front of me. It looked kind of like a bottomless void, but I paid it little heed and shoved my futon inside regardless.Retrieving stuff from my item box was surprisingly simple. The skill came with a list that looked like something along the lines of a video game’s inventory system. It displayed all the items I had inside of it; it didn’t look like forgetting about the contents of my own inventory was going to be much of an issue. All I needed to do to retrieve a particular item was focus on it while reaching into the spatial distortion spawned by the skill. It was incredibly convenient.With tidying up after myself out of the way, I decided to move on to figuring out breakfast; the module in the top right corner of the dungeon’s UI indicated it was probably time for me to eat. Like the item box’s display, the time and date module looked it belonged to some sort of video game—which made sense given that the dungeon had modeled my personalized UI off of some sort of game menu.I opened the dungeon’s DP catalogue and began browsing for something I could turn into a quick bite. There were many options to choose from, almost too many. It took me a while to make up my mind, but I ended up settling on a slice of bread and some cooked bacon, which cost 15 and 30 DP respectively. I casually plopped myself down on top of the throne, the only chair in the room, as I started to eat.Though I’d found myself a seat, I was by no means relaxed. In fact, I was feeling somewhat anxious. I needed to earn more DP. I’d only started with a thousand. My resources were sure to run dry if I just sat around, and I wasn’t exactly what I would call keen on starving to death.There were a total of four different ways to get DP.The first was to wait. The dungeon naturally generated DP as time passed. It seemed that the precise amount of DP gained depended on the dungeon’s size. My dungeon, which was apparently just the throne room for the time being, could only generate a single point once every three hours. The amount I passively gained was so negligible that I decided to rule out the passive gain as inconsequential until further notice.The second method was also somewhat passive. The dungeon would generate DP while invaders were inside of it. Of course, another, more straight forward alternative was just to flat out kill the intruders. Any return resulting from either of these two methods depended on the intruder in question. More powerful enemies provided more DP.The final method was allowing the dungeon to absorb corpses and food items. The method generated varying amounts of DP; it seemed the exact quantity depended on what the dungeon was fed.This is silly. The dungeon kind of needs invaders to show up even though it doesn’t want them. It had to summon me in case they showed up, so they can’t bust up the core. But if they don’t show up, I’ll eventually run out of DP and die from starvation. Actually, on second thought, it isn’t really that silly. The dungeon’s an organism, a living thing. It needs to hunt and eat to survive. You know, survival of the fittest and all that.I needed to get the dungeon up and running soon, but I wasn’t able to do it immediately. I needed to investigate the surrounding area so I could get a better grasp of the terrain. But more importantly, I first had to learn more about myself. I needed to figure out what it meant to be a demon lord.The dungeon’s knowledge base had plenty of information. Biased information. It basically demonized all the potential invaders. I could see where it was coming from. Everything that attacked it was literally trying to kill it. But that said, it’s opinions weren’t very helpful.“Alright, I guess I should probably move out.”I shook my hands and brushed any remaining breadcrumbs off my body as I stood up and looked towards the room’s sole door. To be honest, I was a bit afraid of what I’d find on the other side, but there was no point in just sitting around and idling. I needed to open the door and examine my surroundings.After psyching myself up and taking a few deep breaths, I made my way over to the door and slowly pushed it open.I was immediately greeted by a facefull of cool air. I was in a rock-filled environment, a sort of cave. Massive crystalline stalactites hung from its ceiling. They were so large that they made my eyes go wide. I couldn’t even begin to fathom how long it took them to form. All I knew was that they just had to be absolutely ancient.Beside one of the especially large stalactites was a crack in the roof, likely due to the influence of the crystal structure’s weight. A few rays of sunlight seeped through it. They bounced off the cave’s many translucent rocks and illuminated it with a dim, calming light.One part of the cave was depressed; it was much lower than everything around it. Clear, clean water had gathered and filled the indented section. The water was so pure that I could see right through to the bottom.The only thing that looked out of place was the door I’d come out of. It looked like something that’d suddenly appeared, whereas everything else had clearly formed over time through natural means.Admittedly, I was totally blown away by the beautiful scenery laid out before me. But the cave was only just the beginning. There was still much more to come.After confirming that there weren’t any other living things in my immediate vicinity, I started moving towards the cave’s exit, or rather, it’s entrance. My body was naturally drawn towards the bright, blinding luminescence that poured through it. My footsteps, though light, came back to me as heavy thuds. Every single step I took echoed through the cave.My view of the surroundings opened up as I arrived at the cave’s mouth.The first thing I saw was the sky. It shone a beautiful blue and extended as far as the eye could see. Below it was a luscious green forest. Its trees gently rustled as the wind blew by. A large river passed right through the forest’s center, glimmering in the sunlight as it brought life to the flora around it.A majestic mountain range lay off in the distance. Its peaks rose into the clouds and towered over their surroundings. I could barely make it out through all the high standing mountains, but the horizon was the most beautiful I’d ever seen. Two brilliant shades of blue merged where the sea met the sky.Large, floating islands were strewn across the great blue sky. One even featured a massive waterfall that hammered the earth below with a seemingly infinite source of fluid. The resulting mist converged the light that was shining onto it to form a stunning iridescent rainbow.The world that unfolded before my eyes was baffling, magnificent.No.It was more.It was so gorgeous I found myself at a loss. I had no way to possibly put its beauty into words.Tears began welling up in the corners of my eyes. Realizing that I might one day use my wings to soar through the painting before me had kicked my emotions into overdrive. I was so moved I wanted to prostrate myself before the dungeon core and revere it for robbing me of my humanity.Speaking of, my wings were currently hidden out of sight. They’d gotten in the way when I tried to sleep, so I spent a good bit of time trying to figure out the best way to shrink or fold them. In the end, they somehow disappeared all on their own. It turned out that I could actually extend and retract them at will so long as I focused on them hard enough. Apparently, it was because they were constructed of magical energy. I was more used to being a human than I was an archdemon, so I’d kept them hidden away ever since.It took me a while, but I eventually stopped staring blankly at the scenery and came to my senses. I needed to get back on task. Given that, I once again began surveying my surroundings. The first thing I checked was my altitude. It looked like I was halfway up a mountain. That was the only reason I could see as much as I could. The second thing I did was check whether or not there were any human settlements nearby. The answer to that was no. It seemed I was rather far from civilization.Turning around, I found myself face to face with two things: the cave’s entrance and a giant, steep cliff. I wanted to get higher up the mountain, but I didn’t particularly feel like climbing straight up, so I began wandering around in search of a path that would lead me to my destination.<– Prev — Next –>

The First Living Creature I Encountered Was The Supreme DragonI started looking around and examining my surroundings after finally locating an uphill trail. I looked at the trees, the grass, the flowers, and basically everything else I happened to come across. And each time I looked at something new, I activated Analyze to learn more about it. The skill taught me all sorts of different things. For example. I came to know that sherlmie grass was a potent herb containing a lot of mana, and that I should never eat amanita explodias because they were sure to detonate upon consumption.Long story short, Analyze was convenient, extraordinarily so. Apparently, the ability was something that’d come with my discoloured eye. At first, I was actually quite discontent with my newfound heterochromia. I thought of it as nothing but a reminder of the fact that I too was once a nerdy middle schooler with a penchant for roleplay. But now, my opinion had taken a full 180 degree turn. I no longer saw the eye as a stigma, but rather, a blessing. Learning more about this world’s flora would’ve been much more difficult without it.The skill taught me about many interesting plants the likes of which I’d never before seen. But more importantly, it allowed me to discover fruits and vegetables fit for consumption. I no longer had to depend on the dungeon and my dwindling reserves of DP for sustenance. And that, in and of itself, was a huge load off my mind.My original objective, surveying the area surrounding the dungeon and getting a grasp of the terrain, had long been forgotten. Of course, it wasn’t because I was careless and got swept up in my excitement, but rather because I simply didn’t need to bother with it. My menu had acquired a map function the moment I took my first step out the dungeon’s door. This new function allowed me to generate geographical information about everything I laid eyes on.All I had to do was look at an area to get an accurate, detailed map of it. Even just emerging from the cave containing my dungeon and admiring the scenery around it had already allowed the dungeon’s menu to learn an incredible amount about my surroundings. The only problem with the map was that it didn’t display enemies, but that weakness was one that I could easily circumvent. There was an option to add an enemy detection feature at the cost of a good bit of DP. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough DP on hand quite yet, but the feature seemed useful, so I made note of it and decided I’d get it some time down the line.After spending a good bit of time taking in my surroundings and wandering about, I decided to head back to the dungeon. I hadn’t gone too far, but I was still worried that something would happen, both to the dungeon, and to myself.With that thought in mind, I turned around—only to catch a glimpse of silver.At first, I’d just thought that it was probably a large bird or something. I’d heard it flapping its wings, but the sound seemed to have come from far away, so I more or less ended up ignoring it.But then it drew closer. I turned my head towards it yet again because I realized how quickly it was approaching. Next thing I knew, the creature was right above me, flapping its wings to lower its speed as it landed. I tried to get a better look at it, but I couldn’t. The force of the wind that came with its descent forced me to close my eyes and cover my face.I didn’t get a chance to gaze upon the creature until the wind finally died down. When it did, I nervously opened my eyes, only to find that the thing that’d landed next to me wasn’t actually a bird. It was something much more majestic and intimidating.A dragon.Its body was covered in head to toe with beautiful silver scales. It was massive, but it carried with it an air of elegance nonetheless.***Name: Leficios
Race: Ancient Dragon
Class: Supreme Dragon
Level: 987
Titles: Supreme Dragon***Uh…Shit.W-What the actual fuck?I’d long been prepared to run into and confront some sort of monster. I was more than ready for it. I knew I had to fight, that I had to prove that I was fit to survive if I didn’t want to die. In fact, I was even kind of excited by the prospect of slaying a monster.But I was not prepared to take on a dragon, let alone the one that stood before me. The silver beast was clearly no ordinary, run of the mill flying lizard. Its title, race, and class all screamed that it was at least a superior specimen.What the fuck!? You have to be shitting me! What kind of unbalanced as fuck encounter is this supposed to be!? Not even the worst games brick wall you this god damn hard! Like, dude! That thing’s level 987. It looks like it’s almost fucking capped, god damn it!The dragon’s level was so much higher than my own that I couldn’t even see its stats.Wait, wait, calm down Yuki. Granny always said that “nothing good’ll ever come out of panicking!” [1] Not that I was actually ever a Granny’s boy, but whatever. Right, anyway, maybe this is just one of those worlds where the levels are super inflated or something. 987 might not even be that high. Like, I’m still level 1, and I’m probably still fucked, but like, I might actually have a chance.I decided to run a more detailed check on the dragon’s stats after momentarily regaining a bit of composure. I started by checking its class, but for some odd reason, I couldn’t get the details to show up, so I moved on and checked its title, as the two shared a name.Supreme Dragon: A title granted to the most powerful dragon in the world, the dragon that reigns above all others. This title drastically boosts the stats of those who possess it. It also provides the “Supreme Ruler’s Intimidation” skill and the unique Supreme Dragon class.…Fuck.I felt the urge to smash my palm into my face.I dunno what I expected. I should’ve seen that coming.The dragon standing before me was undoubtedly strong. It clearly sat at the top of not only this region’s, but the entire world’s food chain. Thinking back, I should’ve realized that something was off. I was totally new to foraging, but despite that, I was able to find food all over the place. And yet, I didn’t run into a single monster. It made no sense for monsters to avoid an area with this much food.Unless they feared a predator.It immediately became clear to me that all nearby monsters avoided this area because they knew that it was the Supreme Dragon’s territory. They understood that it was impossible for them to stand up to it, and that they’d be subject to a one-sided slaughter should they foolishly attempt to challenge it.I, however, had no idea. I didn’t know that I was wandering into the dragon’s den, nor that there’d even been a dragon in the area in the first place.And now, I was totally fucked.The dragon looked towards me and opened its mouth as I stared it, speechless and totally paralyzed in fear.“A superior demon? At a place like this? How curious,” said the dragon, as it narrowed its eyes.Wait. It spoke? IT SPOKE!? THE DRAGON FUCKING SPOKE!?I felt my jaw drop as my brain slowly worked to process the event that had just transpired. I felt the urge to screech out of sheer confusion, but I stopped myself before I did.I knew that I would at least have to seem calm if I didn’t want the dragon to realize that it terrified me. If it caught on, then I’d lose all initiative. I narrowly managed to stop my jaw from dropping all the way as I took a deep breath. Then, I steeled myself and made sure I didn’t stumble over my words as I responded in as relaxed a tone as I could manage.“I uh… don’t know much about the superior part, but yeah. I am apparently some sort of demon.”I mean, I’m pretty sure an archdemon’s a demon. Wouldn’t really make sense for it not to be.Like many other fantasty-esque scenarios, the world I’d been summoned to was home to many similar but different intelligent races. Humans aside, it had demihumans, beastkin, and of course, demons like me. To be frank, I was really looking forward to meeting the races. I wanted to meet beastkin so I could pet them and play with their animal-like parts. I also wanted to meet a demi-human. More specifically, I wanted to nibble on an elf girl’s ears and make her blush.Wait, what the fuck are you doing, Yuki? Stop being all delusional and shit. This situation’s desperate as all hell, but practicing escapism really isn’t going to make anything any better.“What a peculiar manner of phrasing, but no matter. I suppose I should ask the reason for which you are here, demon,” said the dragon, warily.I couldn’t help but notice that the dragon’s voice was pleasant to the ear. Though she and I were different species, I could tell that she was female.“Exploring, I guess,” I said with a shrug.
“…In a place like this? What bizzare tendencies you have.”The dragon blinked several times in an expression of wonder.It doesn’t look like she’s going to attack me right away. Whew. Wait, does this mean that demons aren’t evil incarnate, and that people don’t attack them on sight? I assumed that would be how it was since that’s normally how it was in all the games I used to play.The dungeon’s database had very little information on anything to do with inter-species relationships. It did distinguish between different monsters and races, but it failed to describe them in sufficient detail. All it really did was declare them all fiends out to destroy the dungeon. None of the descriptions contained any real lore or useful information.Thus, I temporarily filled in the gaps in my knowledge by making assumptions based on the information I’d acquired back in Japan. That is, I assumed that demons were evil and considered hostile by basically everything else.At this rate, she might even actually just let me walk away.“But again, it matters not. You have invaded my territory, so I will destroy you.”‘Twas not meant to be, that it was not.I couldn’t help but make a mental quip in an outdated, samurai-like manner of speech as the dragon sentenced me to death. While I would’ve loved to continue with a chain of retorts, I was cut short, disallowed by the sheer amount of bloodlust that filled the air the moment after she finished speaking. It was so pronounced that even I could pick up on it.Cold sweat began running down my brow.I was screwed.My only two choices were to figure something out or die, and I had no idea what to do. My mind was blanking, but I somehow managed to reel it in and force it into overdrive before the dragon attacked me. I had every single part of my brain, which normally did nothing but lazily think about video games, focus every last resource it had on solving the crisis at hand.Alright, Yuki, focus. What can this new body of yours do? Let’s see… Well, its senses are way better… Wait! That’s it!“Hold on! I can make not killing me worth your time!”I pushed both palms in front of me in an attempt to get the dragon to stop.“Can you really?” The dragon immediately froze and narrowed its eyes.
“I can, but you gotta hear me out.” I paused to take a breath. “Let’s strike a deal.”
“A deal, you say?”
“Yeah, and a pretty good one. You like eating sweet foods, right?”
“I-I know nothing of the matter you speak. It is not as if I just returned from raiding a beehive for lunch!”The dragon’s response was so dramatic that it almost made me laugh. She was clearly a terrible liar.Wait, why’s she trying to bluff it off anyway? It’s not like there’s anything wrong with liking sweets, is there?“I mean, deny it all you want, but I can practically smell the honey you just ate wafting off of you, so…”
“A-Again, I know not of what you speak.”
“In fact, you remind me of this yellow bear I used to know. The guy was known for wearing a red shirt and always just reeking of honey.” [2]
“I-I’ve never heard of a bear with such interesting preferences.”
“Well, he does exist, somewhere out there. Anyway, about that deal we were going to strike. You see, I’ve got the perfect thing for anyone that loves sweets as much as you do. Feast your eyes on this!”I pulled a chocolate bar out of my item box and held it up to the dragon. It was something I’d coincidentally decided to buy right before I headed out. I’d heard that chocolate was good for hikes and other long-lasting physical activities due to how filling it was. A single bite was enough to stave off hunger for a good hour or so.“W-What manner of food is that?” The dragon’s eyes were wide with surprise, but at the same time, they also seemed to shine with a sort of excitement. “It carries a wonderful scent.”She seemed a bit hesitant because she recognize the sweet treat as something edible, so I tried giving her another push.“It’s called chocolate. Just try it, I’m sure you’ll love it.”I tore the chocolate bar from its wrapper and chucked at the dragon. She skillfully caught it in her mouth and immediately began biting into it.“What a splendid flavour,” she said, impressed. “It is sweet, but mellow. I knew not that this kind of flavour existed.”A shiver ran up the dragon’s spine as she slowly savoured the chocolate bar’s taste.Her expression was easy to read. She was clearly impressed, shocked to the point of losing all her composure. At first, she was dignified, but now, she almost seemed to give off the same sort of impression as an excited child. The massive shift in her personality was overwhelming. I almost wanted to break into laughter and relax. But that said, I wasn’t about to let my guard down. I wasn’t safe yet. I was still facing something many, many times stronger than me, a creature that could literally kill me with the lightest of scratches. I’d shown her my product and impressed her, but negotiations were still ongoing. I’d yet to seal the deal.“I’m pretty sure I’m the only person in this world capable of making chocolate. I mean, you’ve never heard of the stuff before, right?”I wasn’t one hundred percent sure my statement was correct, but I was at least fairly confident in its authenticity. Though I highly doubted that I was the only reincarnator, I did think that I was likely the only reincarnator that also happened to be a demon lord. In other words, no one else would be able to produce the exact same sort of chocolate that I’d just fed the dragon.“T-that is correct,” the dragon nodded.
“So if I die, then chocolate’ll die with me. You’ll never be able to eat it ever again. But if you let me live, I’ll treat you to the stuff whenever you want.”Feeding the dragon was probably going to drain the hell out of my DP, but it was still a better choice than letting her bite my head off. Besides, most of the creatures that lived in the area seemed to fear her, so having her stop by from time to time would probably serve to keep unwanted pests away.“I only have two conditions. The first is not to kill me, and the second is to allow me to live in that cave over there,” I said, as I pointed towards the entrance of my dungeon.
“Hmmm…”The dragon furrowed its brows. It seemed like it was on the fence.“There’s not really too much to think about, is there? If you don’t kill me, then I get to live, and you get to eat chocolate. It’s a win-win situation.”The dragon turned her face towards me. She opened her mouth, as if to speak, but then suddenly cut herself off by closing it. She repeated this motion several times before finally making up her mind.“…Very well. I accept,” she nodded. “I will allow you to live in exchange for chocolate.”Booyah! I fucking did it! I can’t believe I pulled it off!I felt the urge to strike a victory pose, but stopped myself short. The deal was struck, but its exact terms had yet to be finalized.“The only thing is that I doubt I can actually feed you enough to fully satisfy you. I mean, I’d love to, but you’re a bit too big for that.”
“You make a fair point. Fret not, I’ve the perfect solution.”The dragon’s body began radiating a dazzling light the moment she finished speaking. For a second, I thought I should probably close my eyes, but in the end, I never did. I didn’t need to; the light faded as rapidly as it appeared.Like the light, the dragon was gone. In her place stood a girl that looked to be about thirteen or fourteen years old. She was a good bit shorter than me. If I had a little sister, I would imagine her to be the same height as the dragon’s current form. Her hair was platinum, her face was charming, and her body so beautifully crafted that I’d almost thought it a piece of art. I simply couldn’t believe it to be natural.Every part of her looked human, save for the horns extruding from her head and the long, draconic tail extending from her waist.“Why the stare?” she asked. “The look on your face is as silly as that of a goblin’s.”
“I-I’m just surprised, is all. I didn’t know you could do that.”
“I’ve lived a long life. Taking on a human form is mere childsplay,” she said, arrogantly.
“What is more important to note is that this form requires less food to satisfy.”I analyzed the dragon girl and confirmed that her race hadn’t changed. She was still an ancient dragon.“The time to fulfill our contract is nigh, demon! Provide me with what you promised!”She flung her arms around like a spoiled child as she made her demand. The dignified impression she’d given me when we first met was nowhere to be seen.“A-Alright, but at least put this on first.”I took off my shirt and threw it at her.“Nn? What are these? Your underclothes?” She narrowed her eyes in confusion.
“Well uh, I can’t really look at you the way you are now, so…”The dragon girl was buck naked, which, admittedly, did make sense. Dragons didn’t need clothes, after all. Fortunately, she wasn’t the curvy type. I was sure that a certain part of me would’ve reacted had her appearance just been a slight bit more mature.“I see, then I suppose it cannot be helped.”The dragon smiled and purposefully struck an alluring pose as she replied. She clearly knew exactly what I was getting at.“It is exactly as you say. My body is far too charming, and it simply would not not do for you to lose to your temptations and attack me. Very well, I shall dress myself. Do ensure that you compensate me for my efforts though. I believe the brown substance you fed me earlier would suffice.”“Yeah, yeah, I get it already! I’ll feed you, so hurry up and get dressed goddammit!”[1] Mai otome reference.

The Supreme Dragon Becomes a Freeloader
“I see.” The dragon girl nodded in understanding as she entered the throne room. “So you are a demon lord, and a newborn at that.”The clear curiosity in her voice was only emphasized by the way her eyes darted around the throne room and examined every last meagerly decorated nook and cranny. She was wearing my t-shirt, but that was it. Likewise, I was also half naked. If this were Japan, we both would’ve been arrested on the spot for public indecency.To be honest, I hadn’t planned on bringing her all the way back to the dungeon. I didn’t exactly think it wise for me to reveal that I was a demon lord. I still had no idea as to how all the other races perceived me and my kind; I was worried that she would go back on her word and opt to destroy me on the spot the moment she discovered my identity. Since the catalogue only functioned within the dungeon’s confines, my original plan was to head back home and return to her after retrieving a chocolate bar. But the dragon, being impatient as she was, refused to wait and pestered me until I agreed to let her tag along. My only choice in the matter had been to yield to her whims and bend to her will.Fortunately, my concerns were needless. I’d just been overthinking things. Her opinion of me seemed to have remained constant even though I was a demon lord. She hadn’t suddenly declared that she was obligated to kill me, nor did she proclaim that I was a threat to the races. Instead, she’d just acknowledged that i was the dungeon’s master and moved on.I would’ve loved to continue thinking and making conclusions, but first, I had to get her some clothes. I wanted my shirt back, and I obviously couldn’t just take it and leave her in the nude. I had to replace it with something.Wait, does the DP catalogue even have clothes for little girls?Much to my surprise, the answer to that question was a firm yes. In fact, there was an entire selection.God damn, is this thing convenient. I have to be extra careful with it. I’ll probably end up abusing it and eating through all my funds if I’m not.In fact, I’d already started doing exactly that. I only had about five hundred dungeon points remaining. Half the DP I started with had gone flying out the window.That, however, didn’t stop me from getting her a full set of clothes. I purchased her a simple one piece dress, a pair of matching sandals, and a full set of underwear. I casually tossed the three items, which had cost me 80, 60, and 30 DP respectively, towards Leficios as I asked her a question.“You could tell?” I’d already assumed that the dragon girl would eventually figure out that I was a demon lord, but I’d expected it to at least take her a little more than just a glance.“Thank you. I had forgotten how susceptible my human form was to the cold,” she said as she caught the clothes I bought her. She began changing immediately. It didn’t look like she was feeling even the slightest bit embarrassed, but I spun around and avoided looking at her regardless. “As for your question, the answer is yes. This room is filled with a type of magical energy unique to dungeons. You are its sole resident, and it clearly consists of only a single room. A minor bit of elementary logic is all it took to determine that you were a newborn demon lord.”She paused for a moment, rendering the room completely silent save for the rustling of her clothes.Wait, did she just say that there’s like a dungeon-specific type of magical energy? That means there’s probably other types of magical energy too, right? I think one of my stats is called magic, so does that mean I can cast it? I really need to look into that. I’ve always wanted to give slinging a spell a try.“I see, so the cause of your advent lies with the dungeon. You merely happened to spawn at this location. That is much more understandable. I now comprehend the reason for which you were wandering about my territory.”
“Er, wait, hold up. I think you just made a logical jump I totally missed. You’re making it sound like demons just appear out of thin air or something.”
“They do,” she said.
“Uhh… what?”
“It is true that most demons have parents. Some, however, come into being through spontaneous generation,” said the dragon girl. She was done changing, so she tossed my shirt over my shoulder as she spoke. “Demons appear in places with highly concentrated magic particles. Specifically, they are created when the particles gather around a sort of core.”
“A core?”
“Most cores are made of magic stones, crystalized magic particles. I know not of your circumstances, but I presume your core was born of the power that the dungeon expended to summon you. The magic particles here are especially dense, so it is quite plausible a conclusion.”Dude, demons are weird. I mean, I know it happened to me and everything, but I’m pretty sure normal living things aren’t just supposed to appear out of nowhere.“That aside, I must admit that I am impressed by your dungeon’s elegance,” said the dragon girl. I turned around after putting on my shirt, only to find that she was basically feeling up the dungeon. She was running her small hands along everything within her reach.“Why are you impressed? Isn’t this just how dungeons are?”
“Not at all. None of the dungeons I destroyed in my spare time are even qualified to be compared with your own. They were but mere caves, decorated with the occasional lackluster accessory. I recall only one that differed. It lay under the control of an arrogant fool that knew not his own limits. His dungeon was a castle, one decorated with many a gaudy, tasteless ornament.”Heh, so even the Supreme Dragon finds this dungeon impressive? Damn, dungeon bro, you’re some pretty hot real estate, huh? Wait, did she just say that she destroyed dungeons in her spare time? Holy shit. I would’ve been long dead if not for her love of sweets.The truth of the matter was that I was wrong. The dragon informed me that she hadn’t actually planned on killing me. Though she could’ve finished me off with ease, she didn’t want to bother. Her goal was just to scare me enough to send me running and convince me never to intrude on her territory again. She only would’ve killed me if I allowed my pride to get the better of me. In other words, she only would’ve ended me if I refused to back down. That was the reason she talked to me instead of instantly flattening me from above. Apparently, she had sat there contemplating the deal I proposed to her not because she was debating whether or not she wanted to kill me, but rather, because the cave I was living in lay within her territory. She hadn’t been too willing to relinquish it.I was really lucky she came to the decision she did. The dungeon core was more or less my second heart. Separating me from the cave was no different from strapping a ticking time bomb to my chest.“So whatever ended up happening to the demon with the fancy castle?”
“He declared himself the world’s most powerful being and challenged me, so I reduced him to cinders, castle and all.”Yeah, I figured. What kind of idiot decides to challenge the strongest dragon in the world? That’s just asking for death. Why’d he think he’d win anyway? Shit, I’m actually super curious. [1]Apparently, my curiosity was both obvious and immediately apparent. Seeing the look on my face had led the dragon to heave a sigh before speaking in an exasperated tone.“Demons like you are few and far between. Most members of your race believe combat prowess to be the means to all ends. Demons are known for not only fighting amongst themselves, but also challenging mighty warriors from the other races. Typical demon behaviour is both bothersome and obnoxious.”I’mma guess that probably means most of the other races really do hate demons after all. God dammit.“So, what you’re saying is that all demons are more or less muscle-brains?”
“Muscle-brains? I’ve not heard the term.”
“Muscle-brains are basically idiots that think with their biceps. Most of them have just got more muscles where their brains should be.”
“I see. The expression is curious, but fitting,” said Leficios with a nod. “But yes, that is correct. Demons have been muscle-brains for the past thousand years.”
“The past thousand years…? Wait, you’ve lived for over a thousand years!?”
“I have. And that is in part the reason the humans refer to me as a being of legend.” The dragon girl puffed up her tiny chest with pride.A whole thousand years? God damn, that’s so long I can’t even wrap my head around it. Wait, why’s she so childish if she’s lived for a whole thousand years? She’s got one hell of a sweet tooth for someone that’s lived that long.“Oh yeah, so here’s the thing you wanted, Dragon.”
“Finally! I’ve been waiting!” The dragon immediately grabbed ahold of the chocolate bar I handed her with both her hands, unwrapped it, and took a small bite off the top. “Mmmmnnn! How exquisite! I love the mildness of its flavour!”That “Mmmmnnn!” though.“And I would prefer for you not to refer to me as ‘Dragon,’” she grumbled. “My name is Leficios, and I would like you to use it.”
“Leficios? Eh, that’s kinda long. I’ll just call you Lefi instead. Oh and that reminds me, I’m Yuki.”
“L-Lefi!?”
“What?”
“M-Mind me not. It is just that I have never been referred to in such a manner.”
“Oh uh… I see.”Lefi was an ancient dragon. She had lived over a thousand years. Still, I didn’t find it surprising that no one else had ever called her “Lefi.” She was the legendary Supreme Dragon; she wasn’t the type of person you’d normally address so casually. But as far as I was concerned, she honestly just seemed kind of like the daughter of a relative or something, specifically one that’d started pining for adulthood. To me, Lefi seemed like the type of girl that went out of her way to try to act older than she really was.The dignified aura that she gave off at first was nowhere to be found. It had long since up and vanished.“Again, mind it not,” said Lefi, casually. “More importantly, I would like to inform you that I’ve come to a decision: I will be living here from now on.”
“Uh… what?”
“I am glad I discovered this place. I have grown sick of my roost. It was not the most comfortable place to live, nor the most convenient. I have been looking for a new place to rest my wings, and I believe your dungeon fits the bill.”
“U-Uhhh… this seems really sudden…”
“Can I not stay?”The dragon girl began to pout.“I-I mean, isn’t moving supposed to be something you spend more time thinking about?”
“Can I really not stay…?”Lefi approached me and put on a puppy dog face as she turned her gaze up towards me. Tears began to gather in the corners of her eyes.“F-Fine,” I stuttered.
“Splendid.” Lefi backed off and began to grin the moment she got me to agree. “I am glad to see that our wills are aligned.” She then started happily nibbling on her chocolate bar again, as if the whole event had never happened. I knew that she’d totally just baited me in and played me for a fool, so I ended up twisting my expression into a bit of a wry smile.To be honest, allowing her to stay was well worth it. Though she looked like nothing more than a young girl, she was in fact an apex predator, and not just a local one either. She was one of this world’s most powerful hunters. Her very presence was enough to make the dungeon as safe as could be.Yup. I totally made the most logical decision. I definitely didn’t end up agreeing just because I thought she was cute. Nope, not at all.And so, the Supreme Dragon ended up becoming one of my dungeon’s residents. Specifically, she became a good-for-nothing freeloader.[1] Shitty Hyouka reference. I didn’t keep it literal because it would’ve sounded gross.<– Prev — Next –>

First Battle
The first thing I did the next morning was to take a more in-depth look at my dungeon’s features. As a demon lord, my purpose was to manage the dungeon and ensure that it was safe from invaders. Despite that, I had refrained from inspecting the defense mechanisms. I understood that procrastinating wasn’t something I could do forever, so I made up my mind, got off my ass, and began acting on the responsibility that I put off for so long.Unlike Lefi, I wasn’t a freeloader. I had to pull my own weight. Speaking of Lefi, the Supreme Dragon turned out to be the type of girl that left me wanting to voice a thousand retorts. She had pestered me for a futon the moment she saw mine and persistently nagged until I gave in to her demands. Much to my surprise, she fell asleep the moment she plopped her body onto the soft mattress and had yet to awaken. The fact that she was still passed out served to evidence that she’d taken one hell of a liking to her new bed.My first real act as dungeon master was to increase the amount of area the dungeon covered. The dungeon’s expansion function required me to denote a specific space, so I began by selecting the cave right outside my dungeon. A strange energy pulsed through the cave the moment I hit the confirm button.“Woah! So that’s what Lefi meant by the dungeon’s magic.”The cave hadn’t gone through any sort of visual change; it still looked exactly as it had just a few seconds prior. But the same couldn’t be said for its ambience. All the cool, relaxing air had suddenly vanished. In its place was a sense of warmth and coziness. Though the change felt rather drastic, I knew that I wouldn’t have noticed it had I not been standing in the cave as it happened.I quickly opened my map and gave it a look. Through it, I confirmed that the cave really had become a part of the dungeon. The fact that my territory had expanded caused a shot of excitement to rush through my system. I immediately felt the urge to continue growing the dungeon by increasing both its size and the number of floors it contained. But as I was lacking in DP, I found myself unable. As such, I temporarily shelved the idea and made a mental note to revisit it at a later date.Speaking of DP, I had gained an incredible amount of it. I ended the night with a value somewhere under the 500 mark, but I now had over 2000. The source of my income was obviously none other than the dragon lazing around in the throne room. As she wasn’t one of my subordinates, the dungeon treated her as an intruder, and therefore, a source of DP.At first, I’d thought that her presence would result in a net DP loss. I was worried that she would continue eating chocolate nonstop and slowly drain me of all my resources, but I’d failed to consider the amount of DP that she would generate. I now understood that I benefited greatly from having her around. The effective tenancy agreement we established was just as sweet for me as it was for her. Keeping her in the dungeon meant dealing with her and entertaining her, but the sheer amount of DP she generated was more than enough to convince me to do it all with a smile.“Anyway, enough thinking. I should probably summon something,” I muttered. To be honest, I didn’t need to summon anything. The Supreme Dragon’s presence rendered my dungeon effectively immortal. I was sure that nothing would be able to threaten it so long as she remained. Still, I felt that, as a dungeon master, I was at least obligated to summon something. I needed to play around with the system and figure it out, so I opened up the monster catalogue and scrolled until I found the cheapest thing on the list. It was sorted by price, so all I needed to do was navigate to the list’s bottom and give the very last entry a quick tap.Particles of light suddenly began gathering in front of me as the monster I selected was given physical form. The light faded just as quickly as it appeared and revealed a creature with a sort of translucent body. It was tinted blue from head to toe, or so to speak, as it didn’t actually have either. Its entire body was comprised of a single, round blob a bit smaller than the average shih tzu or dachshund.“Wow, you’re much cuter than I thought you’d be.”I gave the monster, the slime, a bit of a poke. Its stretchy, elastic body shook as I prodded it before snapping back into position as I retracted my finger. It seemed to recognize me as its summoner, as it responded to my action by playfully latching onto my hand. The slime was adorable. It was so cute I couldn’t help but think of it as something along the lines of a domesticated pet.“You know what? I’m going to give you a name.” I paused for a moment to think before continuing. “Alright. You’ll be Shii.”***General Information

Kin to the Demon Lord***The slime was weak, but I didn’t mind. It was more than cute enough to make up for its lack of strength. I immediately began thinking about keeping the slime alive, so I quickly checked the encyclopedia implanted in my brain. In reading the dungeon monster entry, I realized that my summons didn’t actually need food. They sustained themselves by consuming the dungeon’s mana. The discovery I made was a highly convenient one. It not only indicated that Shii was an awesome pet that I literally didn’t even have to take care of, but also allowed me to understand that I wouldn’t have to inconvenience myself with preparing meals for all the monsters I summoned regardless of how many I ended up with.Hold up, does Shii’s stat page say what I think it does…?I felt the urge to groan as I realized that Shii’s luck stat was higher than mine.Wait, wait. Don’t jump to conclusions, Yuki. You might not actually be that unlucky. It could just be that your luck stat looks really low because of how high all your other stats are. Yeah, like, Shii could just be super lucky or something. Yeah, that has to be it… Totally… Yeah…I attempted to convince myself that there was nothing wrong with my luck stat, but I failed. I ended up falling to my hands and knees and moaning in despair. The slime approached me and rubbed itself against my legs. Its movements were slow and soothing.“Are you trying to cheer me up?” I asked as I blinked in surprise.The slime leapt up and down over and over as if to say yes.Holy crap. Shii’s cute as hell. I swear it’s even more adorable than all the other pets I’ve ever had combined. Yeah, you know what? Luck doesn’t matter. It ain’t worth shit. I managed to get myself a pet this god damn cute even without super high luck. Bad luck doesn’t exist unless you believe in it. Besides, it’s not like bad luck is really that awful a thing to have either. If you’re normally unlucky, lucky moments will seem all the more special due to how rare and infrequent they are. Lucky people are clearly less lucky because they don’t get the same rush from actually striking gold. Yeah, I understand now. The lucky are unlucky, and the unlucky are lucky. Thanks Shii! I’ve finally awakened to a universal truth, and it’s all thanks to you!I rambled on and on in my head and managed to use a sort of questionable, convoluted sort of logic to assert that there was nothing wrong with me.Alright, that’s enough messing around with the dungeon for now. Screw work! It’s time for Shii and I to deepen our friendship!And so, I spent the rest of the morning playing with Shii—Or at least that was what I intended. The map shot open in the middle of our play session. An enemy had entered the dungeon.A low growl suddenly came from the cave’s entrance, so I quickly spun my head around to face it.There, I saw a sort of wolf. It had three demonic looking heads, each decorated with a bizarre, ferocious face. For a canine, its body was massive. It looked even larger than the average golden retriever.***General Information
Name: None
Race: Cerberus
Class: None
Level: 32***A wave of nervousness washed over me as I analyzed the enemy, only to realize that I couldn’t see its stats. Its level was too high. To make matters worse, the cerberus was the first monster to have ever intruded upon my territory. I didn’t know how strong it was, nor how I was supposed to deal with it.Likewise, Shii also seemed kind of scared, but the slime stepped forwards regardless. Though Shii lacked a head, or any other appendage for that matter, I could still kind of tell that it was glaring at the dog in an attempt to intimidate it.Damn. Shii’s got guts. Wait, is it just me, or does this kinda feel like a P*kemon battle?“Alright Shii, you got this!”The slime gave its body a bit of a shake. Though I didn’t speak slime, I could tell that it was trying to say something along the lines of “leave it to me!”Seeing my pet’s reliable reaction caused me to shake off my nervousness and get a hold of myself. I realized then and there that my foe was irrelevant. It didn’t matter how strong my enemies were. Their power levels changed nothing. As a demon lord, my task was to annihilate any and all invaders, regardless of how weak or strong they happened to be. And fortunately, I was equipped with all the tools I needed to do exactly that.I had never been the type of trainer that bred or EV trained my Pokem*n. Nor had I ever bothered grinding just because I was worried about an upcoming gym battle. I’d always just pushed on with nothing but my own strategic mind. And never once had I failed I saw no reason for my current scenario not to follow the same trend. It was time for me to begin my tale as that underdog that rose above all that stood in his way.Come at me dog! I’ll show you the difference between a wild Pok*mon and one under a real trainer’s control!“Alright Shii, show ‘em what you got! Let’s start things off with a Quick Attack!”Naturally, the slime wasn’t able to pull of a real Quick Attack, but it obeyed my orders and attempted to tackle its foe nonetheless. Unlike a real Po*emon, the cerberus didn’t just sit around and wait for its turn. It instead swatted my slime away as if it were nothing but a mere nuisance. A single wave of its front paw was all it took to send Shii flying into the side of the cave. The slime lost its form as it came in contact with the rocky surface, splattering its insides all over the wall.“The hell do you think you’re doing to my pet, you fucking mangy mutt!?”Thinking back, I should’ve known that there was no way Shii could have possibly beaten the cerberus. Slimes were literally the weakest monsters the dungeon could summon. There was simply no way for one to beat something that was not only innately more powerful than it, but also a good 30 levels higher. Though it was in part due to my own stupidity, I ended up getting angry at the wolf-like monster regardless. I immediately ran up to it in a fit of rage and shoved the sole of my right foot into its torso. The attack I launched was poorly formed; it was a typical yakuza-style front kick.The three headed dog didn’t even so much as try to dodge the attack. It simply stood there and tanked it—only to burst into a thousand different lumps of flesh.“Uh… what…?”All that was left of the “dog” was an indistinguishable piece of meat. Its entire upper body was missing. My surroundings had been dyed a deep shape of crimson and decorated with all sorts of guts and entrails. And of course, the exact same could be said for my body. I was covered from head to toe in red. I was so confused by the outcome that I stopped what I was doing and just stared.The heck? Was that it? Seriously?After a brief pause, I directed my gaze back towards the “dog.” There was no doubt that it was dead. It wasn’t moving any more. In fact, it wasn’t even twitching.Unlike when I encountered Lefi, my newly improved senses hadn’t screamed at me this time. My body hadn’t warned me about any sort of impending doom. That said, I’d still assumed that the Cerberus was stronger than me. It was a whole 31 levels higher, so there was reason for me to believe that its stats would totally trump my own.But clearly, I was wrong.Hmm… Did it maybe not react to my kick because it just couldn’t keep up with how quickly I was moving? And does this mean that my stats are actually pretty high? Wait, I just beat up a pretty high level monster. I should probably double check my status card to see if anything’s changed.***General Information

Demon Lord from Another WorldDP: 2250***Defeating the cerberus had earned me a good chunk of experience. My level had increased by eleven, and most of my stats had gone up a good bit. The only one that had remained static was luck, but I didn’t care. I was already over it.I mean, again, I still don’t really have anything to compare myself to, but I guess my stats are actually pretty decent.Though I discovered that I wasn’t actually as weak as initially anticipated, I wasn’t about to let myself get cocky. I knew that there were all sorts of abnormally strong freaks out there. Hell, I lived with one. Naturally, there weren’t Lefi-tier creatures just lying around all over the place, but I was still going to play it safe. I didn’t want to end up like the video game villains that shouted “impossible” upon losing to the protagonists because they assumed that their high stats would allow them to triumph. Nor did I want to end up like the foolish demon that had challenged Lefi, only to lose his pride and life in one fell swoop. No way in hell was I about to let myself be stupid enough to wastefully discard my second life.Wait! Why am I sitting around thinking about random bullshit!? This isn’t the time for that!“Shii, you okay!?”I closed my status window in a hurry and ran up to the slime-stained wall. Fortunately, the cerberus’ attack hadn’t been enough to drain all of Shii’s health. The slime was still alive. In fact, it had already started regenerating.“Whew…” I heaved a sigh of relief. “Sorry, I pushed you way too hard. I should’ve known that the cerberus would be too much for you to handle.”The slime responded to my words by giving itself a shake. It was almost as if it was saying “Don’t worry, I’m okay.”Almost.Again, I didn’t speak slime, so I couldn’t actually tell.Alright, from now on, I’m going to need to remember that Shii’s a pet. Pets and P*kemon are different. Pets aren’t meant for battles. They’re just there for you to cuddle and love. Ugh… this is all my fault.I frowned as I realized that I had to be more rational. I’d lost control not once, but twice. A fatal mistake. I’d end up having the rug pulled out from under my feet if I didn’t learn to keep my cool.Maybe I should make “stay cool” my motto or something.I nodded and acknowledged the idea as I plopped myself down beside Shii. Only after the slime finished regenerating did I finally return to the throne room.<– Prev — Next –>

TL: SupremeTentacle
Editing: Joker “Hmmm…” I propped my face up with one of the arms I had resting on my knees as I frowned. I was seated upon the throne, which I’d slowly become accustomed to.
“What is the matter?” Lefi asked. “You appear awfully focused for a man staring off into the void.”The dragon girl stopped poking Shii to give me a dubious stare. She’d been complimenting the slime just a minute prior; she mentioned that she found it surprisingly adorable. Despite living for over a thousand years, today was the first she’d ever interacted with a slime.“It’s nothing spe—Wait, did you just say the void?”Can she not see the menu?“Indeed. It appears as if you are flying off into the distance in a manner akin to that of a fool. The only conclusion I can possibly draw is that you are gazing upon your status, as I do recall you mentioning that you had the analyze skill,” said Lefi. She nodded as she spoke, as if coming to some sort of understanding.
“You make it sound like you have it too.”
“I do. It is quite the convenient skill. Leveling it has allowed me to fully comprehend everything I had ever needed regardless of the circumstance. I’m sure it would serve you the same. It is unfortunate that there have only ever been a mere handful of individuals that have come to understand its value. Very few have ever fully leveled the skill.”
“Wait, did you not know I was a demon lord until after you entered the dungeon? Wouldn’t analyze have let you figure that out earlier?”
“You are correct,” said Lefi with a nod. “But that is only because I chose not to activate the skill. I assumed you to be just another weak and worthless demon that thoughtlessly invaded my territory. I would have realized that you were more than that when you offered to strike a deal, but I was unable. My thoughts had all been swept away by the sweet scent and flavour of the chocolate you presented me. I had not the chance to give a second thought to your identity.”
“I see.”
“Speaking of chocolate, I would like some.”
“You’re going to get cavities if you eat that much chocolate.”
“What are you saying? I am an ancient dragon. Abnormal status conditions do not affect me,” said Lefi, as if she were stating the most obvious thing in the world.Wait, so cavities are treated like status effects?I opened the catalogue, purchased a bag of sweets, and chucked in Lefi’s general direction.“Hmmm? What are these?” Lefi raised one of her brows in confusion.
“Cookies.”
“How interesting.” The Supreme Dragon opened the bag and popped one of the sweet treats into her mouth. “Mmmrrpphh! How delectable!”That “Mmmrrphh” though.“Relocating was a splendid choice. The food here is delicious and the bedding is comfortable. I knew not that living in a human form was this convenient and comfortable.”Seeing the childish, happy expression that appeared on Lefi’s face as she munched through the cookies I presented her caused a wry smile to show on my own.Whew. I’m glad she likes the cookies. A full bag of cookies is cheaper than a bar of chocolate and contains a whole bunch more stuff. It’s much more cost efficient.“So I take it you are contemplating your stats?”
“Yeah. I was just thinking that I kinda want to learn how to use magic. Magic’s my highest stat, so I’d imagine I’d probably be able to cast stuff if I figured out how.”One of the biggest factors that contributed to my desire to cast magic was the gruesome scene that followed the Cerberus’ death. Though my physical stats seemed somewhat decent, I couldn’t see myself making use of them. I had spent my past life living in peace; I wasn’t exactly all that keen on blood or gore. More importantly, though I had somehow managed to defeat the three headed wolf, I highly doubted that I would continue to succeed. Monsters far more powerful than the Cerberus were bound to exist, and I highly doubted I would be able to win against them with my physical prowess alone. Likewise, I was fairly certain I would find myself defeated if I attempted to engage a member of the races in physical combat—there was no way a random civilian would find themselves in the midst of a dungeon. The only ones that would challenge me were experienced warriors with much greater mastery over the martial arts than I.I had to get stronger. Some claimed that there was no need for a demon lord, or any other sort of ruler, to train and become more powerful. They vouched that training was akin to throwing away one’s pride. But as far as I was concerned, every member of the aforementioned group was an idiot that had sealed his downfall in stone. And it was for that reason that I intentionally chose not to rely on the Supreme Dragon. I understood that growing dependent on her would one day come back to bite me in the ass.Given this world’s harsh nature, there was no reason not to grow more powerful. My magic stat was my highest, and the world I’d been reincarnated in was one filled with magical energy, so I saw no reason not to learn the art of magecraft.That was, of course, but one school of thought. It was equally valid for me to focus my energies on summoning powerful monsters capable of crushing my foes with ease. But I didn’t. To be honest, there wasn’t any real logic governing my choice. The only reason I’d chosen magic over the monster-based route was because I wanted to use it. That was all.The only problem was that I lacked the technical know-how. I had absolutely no idea how I was supposed to even begin to cast a spell. I tried firing off a kameham*ha[1] and even tried to stop time by screaming “the w*rld[2],” but neither approach yielded any results—not that I was expecting them to. Both attempts had just been for kicks. But all jokes aside, the kick I performed netted me the martial arts skill, so I figured that doing something along the lines of casting a spell would net me a skill centered around magic.The problem is that I don’t even know what magical energy really is.At first, I thought that I would be able to just feel the mana inside of me in the same manner that I’d somehow managed to feel the dungeon’s mana, but I couldn’t quite get it to work. I tried concentrating and even meditating, but all my attempts had ended in failure. A part of me suspected that I’d only proven unsuccessful because Lefi’s joyful, entertained cries had distracted me and prevented me from truly focusing, but that didn’t quite seem to be it. I believed that it was more likely that I just didn’t have the right kind of approach.“That is true. Your magic stat does appear to be above average,” said Lefi. “Oh? Your level increased? I assume you defeated a monster or two while I was asleep?”
“Yeah. Oh right, that reminds me. I’ve been meaning to ask you for future reference, but how are my stats?”
“Of course, monsters have different specializations, so it is difficult to provide you a meaningful comparison. I can, however, affirm that all of your individual stats are at least average when compared to the monsters that have made the surrounding area into their territory. Naturally, there are still many far more powerful than you. For example, your stats fail to reach even a single percent of my own.”Less than 1%!? Holy shit, dude, that’s insane!Lefi tossed the last cookie into her mouth as I contemplated the sheer extent of her strength. Her expression made it clear that her thoughts failed to align with my own. All she cared about was that there were no longer any cookies for her to snack on; she was wearing a clear expression of disappointment.“Of course, I mind not teaching you the magical arts.” She shot a few glances at me as her face lit up with expectation. “But only if you are willing to pay the pri—”I cut her off by chucking a second bag of cookies straight at her. I didn’t bother saying a word. I could tell from the look in her eyes alone that the bag of sweets I offered her was more than enough to cover my tuition.“I see that you understand my terms. Very well, I shall make you this century’s most powerful mage!”Times like this, I really have to appreciate just how easily she’s swayed by her stomach.[1] The Kamehameha from Dragon Ball.

Let’s Use Magic! – Part 2
Editor: Joker “If you wish to cast magic, then you must first learn to feel the flow of mana,” said Lefi. She swept the cookie crumbs off her dress and disposed of the plastic bag by handing to Shii, who happily consumed it without any complaint. The encyclopedia in my head claimed that the dungeon’s monsters didn’t actually need sustenance, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t eat. Clearly, the slime thought of the plastic bag as a sort of delicious treat. I had been worried about the effect of modern trash on the local ecosystem, but Shii’s willingness to consume it put an immediate end to my concerns.“Hold out both your hands.” Lefi stuck out her hands while instructing me to do the same.
“Uhh… alright.” I didn’t really know what she was trying to do, but I shrugged off my doubts and did as she said.
“Woaaaah! The hell’s going on!?”A sort of powerful energy began flowing through me the moment she grasped my hands. It continued to flow from her right hand and through my body before cycling back into her through her left.Its identity was evident.The strange power I felt coursing through my veins was magical energy, mana.The intense stream of power flowing through our bodies was clearly of a different nature than the mana that filled the dungeon. It felt like it was raging about within me, like it would crush me if I let my guard down, even for just a moment.Lefi kept the magical torrent at full blast for a few minutes, then slowly began reducing the amount she cycled through me bit by bit before finally cutting it off altogether. I collapsed the moment she did. My breath was ragged and my heart totally out of control. Barely any time had passed, but I felt as exhausted as I would had I run a marathon at full sprint.“It appears that you are fortunate. The process went well.” Lefi flashed me an amused smile as she spoke.
“For..tun…ate…?” I was so out of breath that it took me three breaths to speak a single word.
“The process I just completed was to forcibly incite your magical energy to action by invigorating it with my own.” She shrugged as she spoke in an indifferent tone. “The process would have failed had you been unable to endure my essence, and your head would have burst in a violent explosion of blood and gore.”
“T-The heck did you just do to me!? That’s hella terrifying!”Lefi responded to my outburst with yet another nonchalant shrug. “Fret not. I only chose to conduct the act because I had judged that you were powerful enough a demon to endure my essence, and I was proven correct.”
“But—”
“That is enough. Save your complaints. Begin to cycle your magical energies throughout your body before you forget the sensation. I would wager that it has become a rather simple task.”I wasn’t exactly satisfied with the reason she’d put my life at risk without so much as even telling me, but I shelved the thought for the time being and did as she said. That is, I stood up, closed my eyes, and began to focus.Lefi was right. I could feel it. I could feel my mana. Most of it was centered in the area around my solar plexus. Though I hadn’t been able to feel even the slightest bit before Lefi had acted, I was now able to actively pick up on it.I began to move it around by emulating what Lefi had used hers to do just a few moments earlier.I had a bit of difficulty getting my mana to start moving. It was kind of like stirring a viscous liquid with a spoon. It resisted quite heavily at first, but it started smoothing out and speeding up as I continued to push on it. The glob of magical energy soon began to spread and circulate throughout my body. It didn’t take too long for it to feel as if it reached every single last capillary. And since I wasn’t dealing with any sort of external energy this time around, moving my mana didn’t disorient me or make me feel sick. It was kind of like how some people had the tendency to get carsick if they weren’t at the wheel. Everything felt fine since I was the one in control. I hadn’t ever driven a car myself so I couldn’t confirm that this and that were exactly the same, but it was at least something along that vein.“Splendid. You have succeeded in bringing your mana to an active state. It is precisely that state that serves as the basis of all magic.” I could hear Lefi. I knew that she was talking to me, and I understood what she was saying, but I couldn’t respond. I was too focused on moving my magical energy through my body to actually squeeze out any sort of reply. “It has come time for us to move on to the next step. First, you must envision what I describe to you, and then you must recite the chant I speak.”Lefi paused to wait for me to reply, so I squeezed out a bit of a nod.“Imagine a wide open field, a grassy plain.” Her words caused the area surrounding the dungeon to appear in my head. “Focus on but a single one of the flowers therein. Pick it, stem and all, and place it within your palm.”The scale of the image in my mind suddenly shrank; I imagined myself plucking one of the flowers right by my feet.“Are you done?” She awaited another nod before continuing. “Good. Hold out your hand and repeat after me: ‘Create Bloom.'”
“Create Bloom.”A portion of the magical energy circulating throughout my body suddenly focused itself in my left hand as I repeated Lefi’s words. I waited for the outwards flow of mana to stop before finally opening my eyes.“Woah, that’s a pretty flowe—wait, what the hell!?” I tossed the flower aside as I complained. Though I’d chucked it without a care, it ended up gently making its way to the ground.
“What?” Lefi cocked her head. “Are you dissatisfied?”
“Yes and no. Using magic for the first time was pretty awesome and all that, but like… why a flower? Couldn’t we have done something, you know, a little more impressive?” I couldn’t help but point out the fact that creating flowers wasn’t exactly what I had in mind when I thought of magic.“That is merely because the spell was only meant to serve as your introduction to magic. We shall immediately move on to grander things. I would like you to cast another spell, and this time, envision a flame. You need not chant. All you need is to imagine yourself forming a flame with your mana. The clearer the image, the better.”
“Alright…” I directed my mind back towards my magical energies and urged them to move. As it was my second time, my mana felt less weighty and more susceptible to manipulation.Honing myself in on the concept of fire, I envisioned a lighter, specifically one of the Z*ppo types I had back home. The image came to me with surprising ease. Both the metallic object and the flickering, bright flame it produced were crystal clear.The flint within the lighter could create a spark, which in turn would ignite the oil it released to create a steady flame.“Rgghhh…”A small groan escaped my lips as I focused my mana and guided it through my arm. The slightest bit of my magical energy drained from the tip of my index finger and blossomed into a flame.“Woah…” I couldn’t help but gasp in wonder. Holy shit. That’s fuckin’ awesome.My skills were the very definition of shabby, but, I paid it no mind. I was too preoccupied by the fact that my finger was emitting fire to care. Casting one’s first spell was an epic act that would drive any man to a state of excitement. And though they might have seemed it, my actions were not even the slightest bit childish. Creating a flame at one’s fingertip was too great a fascination to be bound by the concepts of age and maturity.“Very good. I see that there is reason they say demons make for splendid mages after all.”
“Oh, that’s a thing?” I gave Lefi an idle reply as I turned the flame on and off over and over.A couple sparks would fly through the air every single time the flame ignited, likely because the image I had in mind was that of a Zipp* lighter. I wasn’t all that enthusiastic about the excessive realism, but I didn’t mind it too much because the sparks were aesthetically appealing in their own right.“Indeed. Most would be unable to manipulate their mana to such an extent the moment after their magical circuits are forcibly wrenched open. That is a trait that you can thank your race for.”Huh. Neat. I picked up magecraft much more easily than I really had the right to. Even I was expecting it to take a lot more effort and time.“It is because demons are creatures originally born of magical particles,” explained Lefi. “It only makes sense for your body to have been constructed such that you have a strong affinity for the manipulation of mana.”Her explanation made total sense. There couldn’t have been any other reason for someone like me to be able to pick up on magic so easily given that my old world had been completely devoid of it.Though I was interested in Lefi’s justifications, my attention was still too heavily focused on the flame floating right above my fingertip for me to provide much of a response.I wonder if I can adjust its strength…According to the dragon girl, the most important thing was the image I had in my mind, so I promptly began imagining a flamethrower. I played a lot of FPS games prior to reincarnating and most of them had flamethrowers. They tended to be rather finicky and only really worked under certain scenarios, but I liked and used them quite often nonetheless. I wanted to make my fire magic work in much the same way, so I closed my eyes and carved out a mental image of the heat-based weapon.“W-Woah! The heck!?” Violent roaring flames began spouting from the tip of my finger the moment I pictured them in my head. I immediately reacted and pulled my finger away from my face, but I wasn’t quick enough to stop myself from getting blasted by a sudden heat wave. The flames flew so close to my face that I was sure they singed my bangs.Shii, who’d been idling around nearby, began bouncing around in panic. Its body language was clearly saying “What the heck!?”“W-What are you doing!? Stop pouring magical energy into the flame immediately!” Even Lefi was startled.
“H-How the hell am I supposed to do that!?”
“Cut off the flow of your mana! Do not allow it to cycle any further!”The dragon breath began dying down as I suddenly began cycling my magical energy in the opposite direction to force it to a stop. It sputtered a few times like an engine that’d run out of gas, before finally coming to a stop a second or two after my mana finally stagnated.Lefi, who’d backed off upon seeing the flame, heaved a sigh of relief as she returned to my side.“That… was quite the shocking experience,” she remarked.
“I-I know, right? Holy shit, my heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to burst out my chest.”
“You must remember to take care in adjusting the output of your magical creations. As one that is naturally gifted with the magical arts, you will find that it is easy for you to accidentally produce an effect much grander than what you anticipated. You will only bring harm to yourself if you carelessly infuse your spells with as much magical energy as you can muster.”
“Y-Yeah, my bad.” I took her lesson to heart; I’d only just almost charred my own face black, after all.Yeah uh… I think I’mma hold back on casting any more fire magic for now. I probably shouldn’t play around with it until I at least kinda know my shit.

“I digress, as I believe I have taught you all you need to know for the time being. To reiterate, magic is, in essence, the power of your imagination. It is none other than your very own imagination that serves as the basis for casting spells, and thus, it is also your imagination that allows you to create your very own magical techniques. Many humans and demons misunderstand the nature of magic. They believe it to be centered around the aria, the chant. And they are incorrect.” Lefi paused for a moment to take a breath. “Both a spell’s chant and name exist only to reinforce one’s image of it. They are but auxiliaries, unnecessary extras. You are a demon, a creature with the innate talent for magic. You need not ever chant lest you plan to cast a powerful spell that requires an absurd quantity of mana to activate. And even then, it may prove unnecessary. Never forget, the secret to magic is to have a vivid imagination. And that is all.”“A vivid imagination…? Alright, got it. My imagination’s the whole reason I almost burned my face off, so I’ll make sure I’m careful.”
“That would be for the best.” It seemed that Lefi was pretty much done with her lecture, so I asked her one of the questions that’d been on my mind throughout.
“So uh… do you think I can do anything other than just making flowers and lighting fires?”
“Though I now understand that you have an affinity for both earth magic and fire magic, I cannot say as to whether or not you will be able to use any of the other elements. You’ve little choice but to test them out for yourself.”
“What other elements are there?”
“The four basic elements are earth, fire, water, and wind. These four classifications are, unfortunately, incomplete. They do not encompass all that there is to magic, and they are only described in the manner they are such that they are easy to comprehend. There are, of course, other elements as well. Some have been known to manipulate facets such as time, light, and darkness. There are many more out there, and that is why I cannot provide you a true answer. You must experiment to determine your capabilities.”***I tried out several other elements under Lefi’s supervision and concluded that I was proficient in both water and wind. I proved my affinity for the former by creating water at just the right temperature for a hot bath, and the latter by generating a warm breeze with just enough power to dry stuff out. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get any other elements to work. I assumed that meant I simply didn’t have the affinity for them, but Lefi told me I was mistaken. It was possible that I had simply yet to awaken to them.I wasn’t able to do much with wind magic other than just change up the intensity. I could function as a pretty decent hair dryer, but that was pretty much it. It was more like I had an affinity for hair dryer magic than I did true wind magic. Water, on other hand, proved much more promising.“Could you perhaps manipulate your spells such that they are less bizarre…?”
“I can’t really help it. This is just how it all ends up coming out. I really can’t imagine any of this working any other way.”Trying out a bunch of random stuff allowed me to learn that magic was indeed about one’s imagination, but you couldn’t just picture anything and have it work. You had to have a really strong image of what you were trying to do or it would just end up as a flop.I found it easiest to actually get stuff to work when I used magic to make things I was used to and could easily picture. That was why all my spells ended up creating things I was exposed to in my everyday life.My imagination was rather lackluster, and my memory apparently wasn’t that great either, as I couldn’t get my wind magic to do anything gamey. It was a shame, but neither my wind nor earth magics proved too useful. Fortunately, water was different. I could actually get it to kind of do what I wanted it to, likely because my affinity with it was just that much higher. I had a pretty good starting point, so I doubled down on water magic and began practicing it.A minor bit of training ended up being enough for me to get good enough at it to create a dragon made out of water. To be specific, it was a dragon made out of warm cozy bathwater, but still, it was a dragon nonetheless.“What are you doing now?” Lefi narrowed her gaze as she watched me grab the bathing set I just purchased with DP. I filled the wooden bucket with warm water before moving my fingers up above my head. I cast another spell and turned my finger into what was effectively a showerhead.
“Nothing special. I just thought it might be nice to wash my hair.” I wet my hair and began shampooing myself as I replied.Shii began absorbing the soapy water as I rinsed it off my head. The slime was gulping it down, bubbles and all, as if it were enjoying a sort of snack. I was glad that my newfound pet was making everything so convenient for me, but I was starting to worry for its health. Though I knew very little about slime biology, I somehow doubted that downing shampoo would be good for the tiny blue critter.I mean, Shii looked pretty happy eating garbage and whatnot, so I guess it’ll probably be fine… Probably.I wasn’t too sure everything would go well, but I decided to use magic to blowdry my hair after finishing a first pass with a towel.Awwww yeeeah. That feels hella good. The fact that I didn’t actually get to bathe yesterday was bothering me, so this is great.“…”“What?”
“I would like for you to do that to my hair as well. Would you mind?”
“Well, I guess I might as well. You teaching me magic is pretty much the only reason I can pull this off, after all.”
“My intention was not for you to learn magic so that you would be able to bathe yourself…”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Enough sass. Get your head over here.”Lefi was clearly exasperated, but she complied, so I ending giving her hair a thorough wash.***Hey, guys! Joker here.

The Spoilt, Good-For-Nothing Dragon
Editor: Joker
“So? What do you have to say for yourself?”I sat on the throne with one of my arms propped against the side of my face. The tall armrests made the position feel natural so long as I leant forward. Perched atop my lap was a relaxed looking Shii. The translucent blue creature wasn’t doing anything in particular. It was just sitting around and enjoying my company.“I-I am innocent, I swear I had no other choice! M-My circumstances were dire, and I did only what was absolutely necessary!”The Supreme Dragon, Leficios, was positioned before me as would a pleading subject. She was sitting on her ankles and knees with her back straight as a rod. The air was tense, the mood reflected in the dragon’s indignant, panic-stained voice—one that could only ever be exhibited in a party attempting to deny their guilt.“And what, exactly, are these dire circumstances of which you speak?” I felt the urge to roll my eyes, but I played along and encouraged the dragon to defend herself.Unsurprisingly, my query was only met with silence. Lefi didn’t even breathe, let alone speak to justify herself. The only action she took was to stubbornly refuse to meet my gaze.“I swear…”The dragon girl twitched as I breathed a heavy sigh, much in the same manner as would a child anticipating punishment. All semblance of the dignity that she’d borne when I’d first laid eyes on her had vanished. It was gone with the wind, nowhere to be seen.“Say something already goddammit.” Again, I sighed. “Look, I’ll be fair. I’ll let you off if there really were extenuating circumstances.” Not that I believed her, of course, but I didn’t tell her that. I wanted to encourage her to speak, and informing her of my suspicions clearly wasn’t going to help.
“Well…” Lefi began to speak, only to once again shut her mouth and avert her gaze.
“Go on.”
“I-I was unable to stop myself! It was all far too delectable!” What came out after a moment of silence could only be described as an indignant scream.Yeah, I figured that was probably what happened.“Look…” I heaved yet another sigh. “You really need to learn to be a bit more patient. And I really shouldn’t be lecturing you about this. Haven’t you already lived over a thousand years? What’s waiting just one day compared to all that?”
“I really could not help myself!”
“Couldn’t help myself, my ass! God damn, good for nothing, spoilt excuse of a dragon!”
“What!? How dare you! I will have you know that I am not ‘good for nothing’ by any means!”
“Bulllllshit! You don’t even have the slightest shred of patience! How the hell can you not!? Look at how old you are god dammit! Actually, you know what, you’re right! You’re not a good for nothing, you’re even worse than a good for nothing! Supreme Dragon? Ha! More like Supreme Sponger!”
“Now you are just saying whatever comes to mind!” Again, Lefi shouted in indignance. “And you have only justified my Supreme Dragon title even further! It is none other than I that stands at the apex of predation! It is therefore only natural that I live however I please!”Oh great, now she’s gotten all defiant on me.“Give it up. There is no changing my nature, for I am the Supreme Dragon, a living calamity of which legends are sung! Engrave it into your heart, for this is the natural order of the world, the way it was all meant to be!”
“Keep that up, and I’ll never feed you ever again.”
“I apologize for my misdemeanors. Please forgive me.”The dragon paled. Her attitude took a second 180 degree shift as she bowed as deeply as she could while apologizing as profusely as she could.So how, exactly, did we arrive at such a situation? Long story short, it all started the morning of the day the incident took place.***“Alrighty. I’m going to be heading out for a bit, so take care of the dungeon for me while I’m out, ‘kay?” I spoke to both Lefi and Shii as I got ready to leave.
“Fine…”
“I’ve left a bunch of food sitting around. You can have some if you get hungry, but try not to eat too much.”
“Very well…”Shii leapt up and down a few times, as if to acknowledge and accept the request. Lefi, however, did nothing but voice one disinterested reply after another as she played with a simple electronic toy. Though I’d gotten it for myself, the Tam*gotchi [1] was a bit too dated for my tastes. I was too spoiled by modern video games to truly enjoy it. Unlike me, Lefi had gotten totally hooked, in part because she’d never seen anything like it in all her years.The T*magotchi was the cheapest gaming device in the dungeon’s catalogue. Its price point was in fact the only reason I’d purchased it, as I really wasn’t all that interested in it. I didn’t actually understand why it was so much cheaper than basically every other electronic, but if I had to guess, I would say it was likely because it was of a smaller size. Unfortunately, the catalogue wasn’t exactly consistent. Its prices were all over the place. And although I’d called it cheap, the Tamag*tchi was still a full order of magnitude more expensive than almost every other non-electronic.According to Lefi, the world I now lived in wasn’t nearly as technologically advanced as the one I’d come from, hence why she found the digital device so novel and charming. Honestly, I was relieved to hear that technology had yet to develop as far as it had in my old world. If anything, I would’ve been seriously disappointed if it was.Lefi had been hella surprised when I first showed her the Tamagotch*. She was so shocked that her eyes ended up almost bulging out of their sockets as she questioned the extent of a demon lord’s abilities. Thinking back, I probably should’ve told her that I was likely the only demon lord capable of such a feat.Speaking of Lefi, she’d totally made friends with Shii. They got along really well even though the two were different species and on complete opposite ends of the power scale. Thinking about it, it did make sense. Though not a human, Lefi was a girl, and like most other girls, she had the tendency to like cute things. And as Shii was the cutest pet there was, it only made sense for the dragon to find herself enamoured by the slime and its adorable antics. She liked it so much, in fact, that I’d even caught her telling it that she would make it the most powerful member of its species that ever existed.Shii, on the other hand, had actually started off scared of Lefi. The poor slime had began cowering and shivering in fear the moment it first laid eyes, for lack of a better term, on the dragon. Only after seeing me interact with her did Shii realize that Lefi wasn’t a threat, and so, it soon began playing with her and snuggling up to her.Like Shii, I also more or less thought of Lefi as non-threatening. It was no longer possible for me to see the fourteen-odd year old girl lying around in the hallway as a thousand year old dragon, and her obsession with the Tam*gotchi really wasn’t helping. As far as my impressions were concerned, Lefi was as young as she looked. And that was all there was to it.I shrugged and forced a bit of a smile as I turned around and headed out the throne room.So why, you ask, would I bother heading outside? The answer to that question was surprisingly simple. It was because I needed to secure additional funding. Or rather, additional DP. Most demon lords got all their DP from intruders. They would slay the intruders that entered their dungeon and recycle their corpses for points.I, however, basically never got any. The only intruder I’d ever had was the one stupid three headed dog that’d attacked not too long after I first summoned Shii. Of course, the lack of invaders wasn’t without reason. My dungeon lay in Lefi’s, the Supreme Dragon’s, territory. None of the local wildlife dared approach it, let alone intrude. That exact piece of logic applied even more strongly to monsters than it did to regular creatures, as monsters were highly sensitive to creatures that were far stronger than them. They knew that Lefi was here, so they stayed the hell away from the area. Likewise, the races also refused to come anywhere near. Lefi’s territory was considered a dangerous, uncharted region that none dared to invade.I was pretty bothered. How was I supposed to accrue DP if nothing would even so much as come near the dungeon? That was when it hit me. I realized that I didn’t have to wait for intruders to come to me if I, or more specifically the dungeon, went to them. In other words, all I had to do was make the dungeon large enough to encompass them. Fortunately, looking around was enough to fill up the dungeon’s map, and the Supreme Dragon’s presence had generated plenty of DP, so I had everything I needed to put the plan into action.Normally, DP was used to strengthen the dungeon. Demon lords would invest heavily in adding floors, arming traps, and bolstering their forces. I, however, had the ultimate guardian keeping my dungeon core safe. The sorry excuse for a dragon rolling around atop the carpet was more efficient and effective than S*COM [2] could ever be. Hiring additional guards was honestly just a waste of DP, seeing as how I already more or less felt sorry for any potential intruders.That said, I wasn’t planning on totally neglecting the dungeon. I wasn’t comfortable with the fact that the throne room was connected straight to the exterior. I wanted to add a floor or two somewhere in the middle. That said, I wasn’t going to do it immediately. I was planning on focusing on my economy first and foremost.One of the dungeon’s most interesting aspects was that its floors were highly customizable. I could tweak as many settings as I wanted. I could make floors as small or large as I wanted and I could even make the night sky show up in the day and vice versa. [3]The moment I realized its potential was the moment I decided that I was going to make a floor with a huge ass castle in it once I saved up enough DP. Specifically, I wanted to craft the type of overbearing, ominous castle typical of the final boss of a JRPG.The first thing that came to mind was a certain castle straight out of a certain obscenely difficult game by the name of Dark Whatchamacallit: An*r Londo. [4] I didn’t actually need a castle that ridiculously massive, but I still kind of wanted one nonetheless.Just imagining it sent shivers down my spine. The first thing any potential invader would see after braving the cave would be a massive, looming black structure standing in the middle of a land shrouded in eternal nightfall.The moon, which should’ve been hidden from view given the indoor nature of the environment, would illuminate the centerpiece and provide it a dark, dreadful shadow.The scene I pictured was eerie, but also solemn and majestic.It was perfect.Even just imagining it lit my soul aflame with passion. I just had to have it. As a true man amongst men, I couldn’t resist the castle’s fantastical allure.Er, right. I should probably get back to work.I shrugged off my delusions and refocused on the task at hand. I’d planned to spend the day just observing things, so I activated my Stealth and Detect Enemy skills while also popping open the map as I started sneaking around.Speaking of skills, there were two ways to obtain them. The first was to perform an action that aligned with the skill. For example, punching and kicking would provide the martial arts skill. Although effective, the first method was rather tedious and limited to only that of which one was already, to a certain extent, capable of. The second way, using a skill scroll, was much more convenient. It was possible to obtain a skill by mentally duplicating the glyphs carved inside of a skill scroll while also channeling one’s magic through it. It was a super user friendly tool that basically anyone could use. The only downside was that you couldn’t ever use the same skill scroll twice, but that didn’t really take away from its utility. It was still an easy way for one to learn a new skill.I’d only learned about skill scrolls because I happened to see them while browsing the dungeon’s catalogue. Needless to say, I instantly bought the ones I felt would be most useful right away. While it might’ve been possible for me to learn Stealth on my own, I highly doubted that I would be able to do so efficiently and effectively, hence the purchase. Detect Enemy, on the other hand, was something I highly doubted I would ever be able to pick up on by myself.My stat page had changed. It now looked as follows.***General Information

Demon Lord from Another WorldDP: 10220***My level had risen, but not because I’d slain another monster. All the experience I’d accrued had come from working out. Getting lots of exercise was also why my martial arts skill had leveled up. The analyze skill, on the other hand, had only leveled because I’d pumped all my skill points in it. It was an extremely useful skill, after all.Though I’d just gotten them recently, neither Stealth nor Detect Enemy were at level one. I’d used them whenever I had spare time, so they’d progressed quite a fair bit.Stealth had absolutely no effect on Lefi. She could still see me regardless of how hard I tried to hide. The same, however, couldn’t be said for our little slime friend. Shii would occasionally lose track of me when I popped the skill. It would promptly start looking around and trying to find me, only to start happily bouncing around once it finally did. The way it reacted to our impromptu games of hide and seek was super cute.Both skills ate away at my mana while they were active. I couldn’t keep them running forever, but I could at least maintain them for a few hours back to back. According to Lefi, that, in and of itself, was totally absurd. There was simply no way any normal demon could do the same, meaning that my ridiculous mana pool instead stemmed from the fact that I was a demon lord.“Uh… Okay, I should probably not go over there.”I broke out of my thoughts and stopped moving as I caught a glimpse of a monster that looked kind of like a mix between a tiger and a rhino. As it was in the midst of consuming freshly killed prey, the creature was distracted, but it was sure to attack me if I got any closer. It wasn’t that I couldn’t handle the creature, but rather, that I found it too bothersome, so I decided to back off and choose another route.As evidenced by the fact that there was a monster, I’d strayed quite far from the dungeon. I’d gone so far, in fact, that there were actually both animals and monsters wandering about.I was finally outside Lefi’s domain.This looks like a pretty good spot. Alright, let’s add it to the dungeon!I manipulated the menu and tapped the map a few times before I finally felt the dungeon’s magic flood my surroundings.“Okay, that’s that.” I nodded, satisfied. The expansion had eaten away all my DP, but it was well worth it given that it was sure to bolster my daily income.Well, I’m already here, so I guess I might as well explore a bit more and flesh out the map so I don’t need to venture as far next time.***I returned home quite a while after the sun had set. My stomach was completely empty, so I entered the kitchen, which I’d just bought for a flat 2000 DP just the previous day, and opened the fridge—only to find that it was empty. It was completely devoid of all semblance of sustenance even though I’d just stocked it with a whole week’s worth of food last night.It was cheaper to buy an assorted platter of meat than it was to purchase a specific cut, so I’d gone ahead and done that because there weren’t supposed to be any disadvantages.Turned out, I was wrong.The food couldn’t have just disappeared on its own, so I immediately raised my voice and shouted to get the attention of the only possible culprit.“LEFIIIIIIIII!!”And that was how it had all begun.***God damn glutton. I silently complained as I stared at the now prostrated dragon girl.There had been far more food in the fridge than it should’ve been possible for her to eat. Or at least that would’ve been the case had she not been a dragon. Her true form was much larger than her human form, so she likely had the ability to consume many times her current weight with ease.Man, I mean, I know she eats a lot, but god damn. I’ve never even tried serving her anything close to this much before. Wait, does that mean she’s never actually had a chance to eat her fill? Was she always holding back for my sake? Wait, wait, nonononono. Get ahold of yourself Yuki, don’t let her fool you. It doesn’t really matter what she normally does. This whole binge eating incident’s way too out of hand.I couldn’t exactly let her off for emptying out the entire fridge the very day I’d warned her about it just because I felt apologetic. It was true that she was the source of all my DP. Without her, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to supply all that food in the first place, but that didn’t mean she was entitled to it. The deal was that she would be allowed to stay in exchange for a bed and three daily meals. It was a fair trade, even if she didn’t get to eat ‘till she was stuffed.“Well…” I grumbled. “I guess I just won’t have dinner tonight then.”There wasn’t really any other choice. It was too late for me to go foraging, I was flat broke because I’d just spent all my DP on expanding the dungeon. Man, I really should’ve stored a bit of food in my item box. Leaving it all in the fridge was a terrible idea. Never would’ve done it if I knew this was going to happen. On the bright side, I should have enough DP to eat once I wake up.“W-Wait, I understand, so you need not react with such despondence.” Lefi stuttered as she responded to my idle remark. Her voice was filled with guilt. “You require the bizarre currency that you call ‘poynts,’ correct?” [5]
“Pretty much.”
“W-Worry not, I shall return in a mere thirty minutes!”
“…Wait, what?”My response fell on deaf ears; Lefi had already charged out of the throne room before I’d raised my voice.***As promised, Lefi returned after exactly thirty minutes. Next to her was a ridiculously tall pile of corpses belonging to monsters and animals alike.“This is way too god damn many, you idiot!”
“Whargh!?” The dragon girl made a weird sound as I smacked her upside the head. “Nrgh… That is the first time that anyone has done that to me in the span of the past several hundred years.”She flashed me a reproachful glare.“Colour me honoured then, I guess.” I shrugged.
“I care not about your honour. Answer me this, why did you hit me? Is it not better for you to have more ‘poynts’? I made sure to herd the creatures to the dungeon before butchering them to maximize your gain!”Did she just say herd? I’m pretty sure you don’t just treat monsters like you do cattle or sheep.“Well, yeah, but there’s a limit to everything, and you just broke the hell out of it. Look, you stupid dragon, look at all that blood! There’s literally a fucking pool of it, I could go swimming in that! I’m pretty sure that’s going to leave a huge, permanent, red stain. Plus, I don’t even know what to do with all these god damn corpses!” And then it hit me. “Oh, wait, actually, I do. I can just convert them all to DP.”That’s exactly what I did to that one stupid dog, after all.“Does that not mean that I did nothing wrong!?” shouted the dragon, indignantly.
“Yeah, pretty much.”
“Then why did you hit me!?”
“Well, to be honest, because I was kinda going with the flow. I kinda had this whole angry boss vibe going, y’see.”
“What kind of ridiculous excuse is that!? Were you not just criticizing my lack of responsibility? The claim holds little weight if you do not hold yourself to it!”Lefi glared at me in a mix of anger and shock.“Yeah, yeah, my bad. Here, I’ll give your head a pat to make it all better.” I started stroking her hair as I recited a common phrase from my childhood. “Pain, pain, go away.”
“Yay! I’m so.. Unhappy.” Lefi rolled her eyes as she smacked my hand away. “I refuse to play along with your idiocy.”Yeah, I figured.With all that said and done, I manipulated the dungeon’s menu and turned the stack of corpses into a stack of DP. The whole artificially constructed mountain began to sink into the floor as it slowly melted away. Even the bloodstains disappeared, leaving naught but the bare rock and dirt.“What a peculiar sight that was.”
“I know, right?’ I raised a hand to my chin. “Anyway, that’s more than enough for dinner, so I guess we can call it even. But, look. I know that your real body is kinda big, and that you might not really be able to eat ‘til you’re satisfied, but could you please like, you know, try your best to hold back a bit? There’s a limit to how much food I can make, and I can tell you right now that it’s not going to be enough for me to fully satisfy you.”
“Grrrh.” Lefi groaned. “Fine. But if I do desire food, then I merely need to supply you with ‘poynts,’ correct?”
“Yeah, but uh, let’s be real here. You probably shouldn’t overhunt either.”Please no eradicating all nearby life. I literally just expanded the dungeon so I could farm it for DP…“V-Very well. I will endeavour not to repeat the incident.”
“Please and thanks. Anyway, I’mma go eat. You want some sweets or something while I’m at it?”
“That I do! I would like a portion of cookies!”And so, Lefi and I returned to the dungeon, conversing along the way.***[1] Tamagotchi. These are digital pets that, iirc, doubled as pedometers.

An Event in the Forest
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixShe panted heavily as she desperately pushed herself forward. She was completely out of breath. Her legs felt as heavy as lead and refused to do as she told them. Pain assaulted her as the surrounding plants scraped against her skin each time she forced her way past them.Still, the sorrow and fear that filled her heart drove her to continue. She was so focused on escaping that she was able to put everything else behind her.Her destination was wherever her legs would take her. She had no idea where she was supposed to go or how she was supposed to get there. All she knew was that she couldn’t let herself get caught, that she had to flee the encroaching despair at her back.“Shit!” The rugged-looking man that was chasing her stopped right at the forest’s edge. He clicked his tongue and swore, but dared not venture inside. “This ain’t good. The stupid brat’s gone an’ scrambled ‘er ass into the Wicked Forest!”“The fuck is wrong witchu, man!? Why’d you go and drive ‘er in there!?” An equally rugged-looking but slightly shorter man, the first’s partner, raised his arms in an expression of frustration. “Bitch, we gun’ get our asses beat ta high heaven if we let the goods git away!”“Bruh, we ain’t recoverin’ dat shit. You think I’mma ‘bout to hit up the Wicked Forest? Aw hell no. I’mma gun’ get my ass fucked twice as hard if I do. Hell naw bruh, I ain’t down. I ain’t givin’ that damned ancient dragon anymore booty. Heard that bitch ass been more active lately for some god forsaken reason. Shit!”“Tsk.” The shorter man clicked his tongue as he grumbled. “Bitch ass brat, makin’ trouble for us ‘n shit.”Though the child in question had heard the men, she wasn’t able to make out what they were saying. All her focus was directed towards her escape.***“Hah! Rarghh! Aaaahhh!”A series of splatters rang throughout the forest as I tore through a group of monsters. I shouted each time I swung my blade—a decision I wholeheartedly regretted. The third and final creature erupted into a fountain of blood as its head was torn from its body. As it was angled towards me, the geyser covered my face in crimson and filled my open mouth with a rancid, irony fluid.“Oh god! Gross! It got in my mouth!”I spat a few times to get the blood out of my mouth before swinging the blade a few times to clean off the bits of flesh and gore it was slathered in. Though I’d only intended to behead it, the thing that sat in front of me was mutilated beyond recognition. I couldn’t even tell its genus anymore, let alone its species.Frankly put, my stats were ridiculous. My specs were so disproportionately scaled that they blew my enemies’ minds. Literally. Though I was using a sword, almost every monster I hit exploded from the force of my strikes. My attacks crushed my enemies and transformed them into disfigured corpses.Ugh… Why the hell does this have to be so gruesome? I can practically feel my sanity stat take a hit every time I kill something.My idle complaints were, well, idle complaints. I knew exactly why I wasn’t getting the clean cuts I so desired. It was a combination of several factors. The first was my skill with the sword, or rather, my lack thereof. I’d never truly done any swordplay. High school was the last time I’d touched anything that even remotely resembled a bladed weapon, as my high school’s gym class featured kendo from time to time. The sword I was using wasn’t really helping either. I was using one of the cheapest weapons in the dungeon’s catalogue. Not much could be said for its craftsmanship or efficacy.Playing around with the weapon had gotten me the Sword Arts skill. I could feel that it was indeed helping, but that was it. It was still just level one, so its effects were basically negligible. More importantly, I was a total amateur. I had no idea what I was doing. My ability to use a sword was so pathetic that not even the skill’s meager padding did much for me at all. In fact, Lefi had called me out and asked me if I was playing some sort of game when I tried swinging it around for practice’s sake. Worst of all, her comment wasn’t one made out of malicious intent. She was genuinely curious. The whole situation was so pathetic that it made me want to curl up into a ball and cry.Through combat, I finally learned the value of my innate skill, Magic Eye. I hadn’t truly understood what it meant to be able to see the flow of someone else’s magical energy until I was subject to a magical attack. Only then did I realize that the skill allowed me to discern when monsters were getting ready to cast their spells. It told me how their magical energy was flowing, where it gathered, and even the locations they were targeting before their magical bombardments fully materialized.I’d actually used the skill to dodge a powerful spell just a few moments earlier. I was able to quickly move out of the way of an earth based spell that caused spikes to erupt from right under the target’s feet, impaling and instantly killing them. I was sure I would’ve died without Magic Eye’s assistance. I couldn’t have possibly seen it coming otherwise.The combination of my innate skill’s efficacy and my dislike for gore led me to all but decide that I was going to become the type of demon lord that specialized in magecraft. My eyes provided me the ability to sling long ranged spells at my opponent while dodging theirs with ease. The advantage I had in such a scenario was just flat out unfair.Yeah, I really don’t like actually hitting things with my sword. The sensation of the blade striking flesh is unpleasant, and all the blood gets my clothes wet. Close quarters combat is way too gruesome and unsanitary for my tastes. It’s just… blech.Speaking of magic, I’d recently become totally inept at fire magic. Creating a lighter-like flame had been easy for me when I first started, but I could no longer produce anything more potent than a flickering, weak flame, the size of what you’d see on the end of a matchstick. Apparently, my last experience had led me to think fire magic to be something dangerous. My brain had started unconsciously suppressing it so I wouldn’t hurt myself, and there wasn’t really much I could do about it.I was a bit miffed that I’d effectively thrown one of my more potent affinities down the drain, but I didn’t mind it too much. I didn’t need it. I still had a strong affinity for both earth and water, and I was getting significantly better at both. I was already able to control the temperature of the water I created. All in all, my magic was still a bit on the weaker side. It wasn’t of much use in combat quite yet, but that was fine. I would only get better with time.“Alrighty. Looks like this section of the map’s fully fleshed out.” I continued playing around with the menu as I started to move.Like many others before it, I’d spent most of the day exploring and examining the dungeon’s surroundings so I could further expand my territory. I wasn’t actively hunting monsters. I only fought those that I happened to come across along the way. All my expansions had led down from the dungeon’s entrance; I was slowly taking control of all sections of the mountain that lay beneath my cave. My current income had already become a whole three Lefis worth of DP each day.That said, I was almost always flat broke. I blew all my DP on dungeon expansions every single time I had enough. I was really excited to see how my territory would end up once I was finally done taking everything nearby over.“Wait, what’s that?”I felt like I saw something out of the corner of my eye, so I directed my gaze away from the open map and checked my peripherals. Turning to the left, I immediately saw the thing that’d grabbed my attention. At first, I couldn’t make out what it was. All I could tell was that it was some sort of creature, and that it’d collapsed in a bush.A sticky red liquid garnished its body. It was clearly heavily injured. In fact, it was covered in so much blood that, at first, I’d assumed it to be some sort of corpse. As I had already made the surrounding area a part of my dungeon, I glanced to the right and checked the map, only to find that it was marked as an intruder—that it was still alive.Curiosity got the better of me, so I approached it while keeping up my guard. Only after closing in did I realize that the thing was a young girl. She was covered from head to toe in blood and collapsed face first in the dirt.I immediately ran over and gave her a quick checkup. She had a pulse, but she was unconscious. The deep claw shaped wound on her back seemed to indicate that she’d been attacked by a monster. The gash was deep, it didn’t look like she was going to live for anything more than just a few minutes.Fortunately for her, I happened to have a potion on hand. I opened up my item box and grabbed it. The life-saving fluid was contained in a small bottle; there wasn’t too much of it. Uhh… I think I can just pour it on her, right?The bottle hadn’t come with instructions, but Lefi had briefed me on its use a bit earlier, so I knew what to do. I popped off its lid and carefully started to dribble its contents over her wounds. I took excruciating care not to miss a drop. Despite being a deep laceration, her injury began to close at a rapid pace the moment the liquid so much as touched her. She regenerated so quickly I almost felt it disturbing.“Nrghh…” The girl began to stir after I used about half the bottle. The cuts were flat out gone and her skin had been restored to a soft, glossy state, as one would expect from a child. Her breathing, which had started off shallow and ragged, had returned to normal.Whew… Looks like she’s out of danger. I heaved a sigh of relief after confirming that the girl had made it, finally letting out the breath I’d held since I began her treatment. The process of healing her was so exhausting and nerve wracking that cold sweat had formed on my brow, so I promptly wiped it off with an unsteady hand.As demonstrated by the little girl, the high class potion I’d just used was extremely effective. It allowed the person it was used on to regenerate limbs much in the same manner as P*ccolo. It could repair a giant gaping hole in one’s stomach without much difficulty even though such a wound would otherwise be fatal.Holy shit. You could probably use this thing to just rush things down without a care for how much damage you take. You could even turn a soldier into what is effectively a zombie if you just keep using these things… That’s kinda terrifying.Lefi was the only reason I actually had the potion on hand. She told me that it was better for me to hold onto one just in case, as, although my stats were high, I wasn’t exactly the strongest thing around. Her warning was a fair one, so I’d heeded it even though the potion was a bit expensive. Never thought I’d be using it like this though. I guess Lefi really does give good advice from time to time. I should probably treat her to chocolate or something when I get home.Still, that girl’s in awful shape. Her clothes are torn and ripped, and her pretty blonde hair’s all disheveled. She’s got a lot of injuries, and most of them don’t look recent.A single glance was enough to tell me that the young blonde I’d just treated had experienced her fair share of misery.“Either way, I guess I should probably take her home. It’s not like I can just leave her here, after all.”***Editor’s Note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another early chapter of JM down. We’re getting closer and closer to catching up, aren’t we? Heh. In this chapter, we’re introduced to the apparent resident loli. (I know about her, but in case people are reading this for the first time, I won’t say anything. Read on to learn more. Haha, shameless plugging.) Wonder what her story might be, and what our demon lord, Yuki, might do to the hapless bastards who hurt her. Guess we’ll find out in the later chapters, aye? See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Reality of the Situation
Editor: Joker
“I knew not that you were a pedophile, Yuki.” Lefi insulted me the moment she saw the little girl in my arms.
“Yeah, yeah, that’s enough out of you. I don’t have the time to play along with your silly accusations right now.”I placed the still unconscious blonde on top of my Japanese-styled bed, which I conveniently hadn’t bothered putting away. It, like most of the other furniture, was crammed into one of the throne room’s corners. The corner in question had become a bastardized hybrid of a bed and living room. Stuff was strewn around haphazardly, and the layout was about as far from organised as could possibly be. It was effectively a bachelor’s pad. Needless to say, the throne room’s aesthetic had been ruined. All its majesty had long been consigned to the void.But to be fair, that’s kinda just what ends up happening when you live somewhere. It’s not like you can keep everything perfectly clean all the time, right?“Oh?” Lefi raised a brow as she got a second look at the young blonde. “She is a vampire?”
“Apparently.” I shrugged as I took a quick peek at the girl’s stats.***General Information

Sewing I***Her name is… Illuna. I guess you’d probably pronounce that il-loo-na. I guess I’ll have to ask her when she wakes up to make sure. Her stats are kinda low, but she is a kid, so I guess it makes sense. All her skills are related to chores. I guess she must’ve helped out a lot around the house. She looks what, seven, eight? She must’ve been a really sweet child seeing as how she started helping out that early.“How rare. I’ve not seen a vampire in quite some time.” Lefi’s tone carried a bit more interest than usual.
“What do you mean?”Aren’t vampires supposed to be fairly common in high fantasy?“Both succubi and vampires are renowned for their beauty. It is this precise trait that has led to their downfall. Like all other demonkin, the two tribes have fought against human rule, and so, the humans have spent several decades hunting both tribes to near extinction. Those that survive are collared and sold as slaves. She is likely a victim that successfully escaped her captors following one such hunt.” Lefi stopped for a moment to indifferently shrug before continuing. “It is a fate that would likely befall the children of the forest had they not joined the humans in a pact of nonaggression.”
“That’s stupid…” I frowned. The only thing I felt apart from displeasure was a bit of confusion, as I didn’t know what the dragon meant by “children of the forest.” However, my uncertainty only lasted for a moment. The encyclopedia built into my brain quickly filled me in and informed me that they were basically elves, so my confusion faded and was replaced by a second wave of irritation.The worst part of it all was that, as a former human myself, I understood them. Their motives clicked with me and I honestly couldn’t even find myself surprised. Enslaving those that differed from themselves was such a human thing to do that I didn’t know what to say or how to react. It was like that back in the world I came from too. Slaves have existed throughout almost all of history. Hell, slavery still existed when I died. Tons of people like claiming otherwise, but we never did manage to totally eliminate it. All we ever accomplished was changing our terminology. Some people don’t give two fucks about human rights, especially with all that holy war bullshit going on in the middle east. They call people infidels and treat them like total trash for no real reason. It’s fucking stupid. I’m not surprised that this world’s no different, especially since everyone and their mother’s been at war for god knows how long. To them, it may as well be common sense. But you know what? Fuck common sense. In fact, fuck everything they believe in. I don’t care what the humans think. I’m not going to play along. Despite having mostly human sensibilities, I highly doubted I would be able to get along with this world’s human beings. Their culture was just too ridiculous and barbaric for me to want to deal with them.“Okay, I should probably stop…” I took a deep breath and calmed myself down as I continued taking care of the young vampire. I concentrated on treating her and directed all my attention to carefully sprinkling the rest of the potion on her remaining wounds.“Nrrghh.” My efforts paid off. The girl soon began to stir. The groan she made was quiet and barely audible, but I could already tell from it alone that her voice was lovely.“Oh, you’re finally awake.” I spoke to her as she slowly got up off the bed, her body swaying unsteadily. “Good timing, I just finished treating you. Does it still hurt anywhere?”The girl was half asleep and didn’t seem to have heard me properly. She started looking around with her hazy, unfocused eyes, only to start panicking the moment she realized that her environment was unfamiliar. Her anxiety peaked when she finally got a good look at me. In fact, she couldn’t help but let out a bit of a yelp as her entire body recoiled in fear.“Calm down. I’m not going to eat you or anything. Just relax. Chill.” I wasn’t surprised by her reaction. It was only natural to be spooked if you found a stranger by your bedside the moment you regained consciousness, especially as a child.That said, I’d totally forgotten to account for it. I was expecting her to talk to me and was at a loss because she didn’t quite seem willing.Hmm… what the hell am I supposed to do now?I knew for a fact that I wasn’t going to be able to come up with anything that could calm the girl down. Fortunately, I wasn’t alone. Shii, who’d been napping nearby, woke up because of all the commotion. The strange but cute creature got off the pillow that served as its bed and climbed atop my shoulder. It had no eyes and couldn’t speak, but I could somehow tell that the slime was gazing at Illuna and asking me who she was in its usual, cutesy manner.“Wow, it’s so cute!”Illuna was surprised by the monster’s sudden appearance, but fortunately, it seemed she was more curious than she was intimidated, as she soon began looking back and forth between it and me. It was clear that she wanted to play with the small, blue blob, but was worried that I would lash out at her if she did.“You want to try petting it?”I gave the slime a bit of a nudge and got it to jump off my shoulder and inch towards the girl. Unable to contain her excitement any longer, Illuna timidly stuck out a finger and gave the creature a poke. Its body bent inwards as her finger touched it and sprang back into position with an elastic jolt the moment she pulled away.The gentleness with which she performed the gesture allowed Shii to understand that the vampire really wasn’t hostile. The slime happily bounced closer to her and nuzzled itself against her leg.“That tickles!” Illuna giggled as she began to pat Shii over and over. The unease on her face was gone, replaced by a happy smile. Like Lefi and I, she’d fallen victim to the slime’s charms.I breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks Shii. I owe you one.“Hey there. I’m Yuki. The slime you’re playing with is Shii, and the lazy excuse for a person sitting behind me is Leficios. What’s your name?”
“I beg your pardon!?” Lefi cried indignantly. “I have done nothing to deserve being referred to as a ‘lazy excuse for a person!’”Yeah, right. I completely disregarded the “Supreme Dragon,” and kept my attention directed towards the vampire. Though I knew her name, I asked it anyway because it probably would’ve been weird for me to refer to her with it even though she’d yet to introduce herself.“I’m Illuna!” The girl replied with an adorable, beaming smile.Called it. Il-loo-na was right.“So, Illuna, mind telling me why you’re all the way out here in the middle of nowhere?”
“Uhm… ‘Cause I was being chased by some really scary humans.”
“That sucks.” Looks like Lefi’s guess was dead on. “How about I take you home? Do you know roughly where it is?”
“I don’t have a home anymore.” The little girl started sniffling and tearing up as she shook her head from side to side. “Mom and dad died. All our neighbors died too.”
“I-It’ll be okay! Don’t worry, everything’ll be fine!” I immediately tried to soothe the girl and calm her down. Holy shit. Talk about stepping on a landmine.
“How intriguing.” Lefi laughed. “Not even the Supreme Dragon’s presence is enough to panic you, but the tears of a maiden have you at their beck and call.”
“Oh shut up already, Lefi.”I rolled my eyes at the dragon girl and the obvious look of amusement that decorated her face before turning back to the vampire, smiling, and patting her over the head.“Don’t you worry, Illuna. There aren’t any scary humans around these parts, and you’re more than free to stay for as long as you like. Especially if you have nowhere else to go.”The idiot standing behind me is way scarier than any human could ever be. I doubt they’d ever approach us. Hell, this dungeon’s probably one of this world’s safest havens.“Really?” Illuna turned her eyes up towards me. Her gaze was still teary and her expression wary. Her unease was as clear as day.
“Really. Good girls like you are welcome anytime.”As the person that brought her here. Abandoning her would just be flat out irresponsible. Hell, ditching her in the middle of a forest filled with monsters would be inhuman, demonic even. Er, wait I guess I technically am a demon now, but whatever. There’s no reason for me not to allow her to stay. Our living expenses will go up a bit, sure, but it’s just one little girl. Adding her to the equation really doesn’t change much in the long run.“But the humans said that I was a bad girl.” Illuna cast her gaze downward. “They told me that’s why mom, dad, and everyone else had to die. Because we were all bad.”
“They told you that!?”Illuna didn’t say another word. She instead responded with an uneasy nod, one fueled by the worry that I wouldn’t allow her to stay.Are you fucking kidding me? They said that to a little girl!? I swear to god. I’m going to strangle the living shit out of those motherfuckers the moment I get my hands on them. Rage began flaring up within me, but I quickly quelled it. Illuna was still sitting right in front of me, and I didn’t want to scare her.“That’s just silly.” I forced a smile. “They were probably just making fun of you because they were jealous. I mean, look how cute you are.”
“Really?”
“Really.” I nodded. “Listen, Illuna. You’re not a bad girl, and you’re definitely not better off dead, so make sure you don’t just wander off and die on me, alright?”
“Okay!” Illuna was beaming. “Thanks so much Yuki! You’re so nice! You’re like the big brother I never had!”Your “big brother,” is happy to see you so happy, Illuna. The little girl’s smile was so bright that it was infectious. I could feel my lips curving upwards even though I’d been about to throw a fit of rage just a moment earlier.It was then that her stomach began to rumble, and loudly at that. Her body had finally relaxed enough to realize that it was starving.“We should probably get you fed. What’s your favourite thing to eat? I’m not exactly all that great at cooking, but I can at least kind of make most things.”
“Uhmm… Hmm… Well…” Illuna fidgeted a few times before nervously raising her eyes “C-Can I please have some of your blood?”The heck!? Don’t tell me she’s some sort of psychopath! Er, wait. Right, she’s a vampire. I guess wanting blood’s probably normal as far as her dietary concerns go.“Uhhhhh, alright. But are you sure you want mine in particular?”
“Yup!” Her answer was swift and decisive.
“A-Alright. Go for it, I guess.”I can’t help but feel that this whole bloodsucking thing is a bit of a weird request, but at the same time, her being so adamant about wanting mine makes me feel kinda happy. Wait, what the fuck, Yuki? Getting your blood sucked is not something that should make you happy. Shit, is there something wrong with me? Aw crap. Don’t tell me that I’ve got some sort of weird fetish I didn’t know about ‘till now…“Are you certain you truly wish to grant her permission?” Lefi, who’d stayed a silent observer so far, decided to suddenly cut in and join the conversation.
“I mean, it’s not like it’ll kill me or anything, right?”I remember there being myths about vampires turning people into both vampires and ghouls, but honestly, I don’t really care. It’s not like I’m still human. What harm could another racial shift or two possibly do?“I cannot say you are incorrect, but…” It seemed like Lefi knew something I didn’t, but she shrugged it off and didn’t bother explaining. “I digress. It matters not. Do as you please.”That seems awfully suspicious, but it’s not like I can back out. Illuna’s already looking right at me with her eyes full of expectation. Not wanting to let the young blonde down, I leaned in her direction and offered her my neck.She responded by smiling as she climbed atop my knees and bit down on my throat. Her teeth pierced through my flesh and dug into my veins, but strangely enough, it didn’t hurt. In fact, it tickled.Do her canines secrete something that numbs? Like maybe an anesthetic? Either way, this whole losing blood to a vampire thing doesn’t really feel that much different from getting my blood drawn out through a syringe.Though I didn’t feel any major discomfort, there was in fact a serious problem. The young girl clung onto me and hugged me tight as she sucked my blood. The way she desperately grabbed ahold of me made me feel a sense of affection and attachment.I could feel her warmth and smell her charming scent. That, by itself, would’ve been fine, but her breath had started going ragged. Her hot sighs tickled my ears and stimulated me in a way that made my thoughts go down the gutter. Frankly, it was captivating, almost to the point where I wanted to call it seductive.In other words, it felt like I was doing something immoral, something that any reasonable man would refuse and label lewd.Shit. Holy shit this feels so wrong, but so… right. Wait, no, nononono. God damn it Yuki, get ahold of yourself. Calm down man, it’s okay! You’re not a pedophile. Your will is strong and unshakeable. You like your women a bit older and more mature. You’re normal. You’re normal, and you’re definitely not going to end up developing a bizarre fetish for underaged girls. Come on Yuki, you got this. You’re totally normal. Yup. Normal.“So it is true.” Lefi narrowed her eyes and looked at me as she would a piece of trash.“You really are a pedophile…”“I swear to god I’m not!”God damn it. I knew for a fact that I didn’t sound very convincing. Hell, the claim was so lacking in persuasive power that I wasn’t even able to convince myself.***“Hey Lefi.”
“What is it?”
“Could you do me a quick favour and give Illuna a bath?”I was feeling really tired. My body was fine, but my brain was total mush, and I couldn’t even so much as find the energy to get up, so I asked Lefi to help me handle a newfound chore.Illuna wasn’t actually able to drink all that much blood at once. The rate at which she sucked blood was higher than the rate at which she drank it, so much of it ended up leaking out the side of her mouth and spilling all over her clothes—if you could call them that. As far as I was concerned, the thing she was wearing was nothing more than a rag. It was torn all over because of her little forest escapade, and the back was in especially bad shape. The claw marks made it so most of her skin was exposed. Moreover, she had obviously sweat buckets when she desperately fled from her pursuers. Both the girl and her “clothes” were about as far from clean as could possibly be.We had a pretty decent bathroom, and there wasn’t much of a reason not to have Illuna make use of it. It was the type you’d often seen in small apartments in that it served dual purpose as a toilet and a place to bathe as opposed to just one or the other. [1]It was a recent addition and the first renovation I’d performed since creating a kitchen. Both the kitchen and bathroom were considered dungeon facilities. I’d bought them through the menu, and I could customize them through that exact same interface. There were lots of options. I could make the tub as big as a pool or even source the water from a hot spring. I was really keen on the latter of the two options and planned to save up DP to get it sometime in the foreseeable future.“I am not one to work for free, Yuki.” Lefi grinned and folded her arms as she gazed at me.Oh, god damn it. I’m way too tired for this shit.“Fine. Two bags of cookies.”
“You are grossly underestimating the value of my time. I require a minimum of three bags.”
“And you’re forgetting that everything I have the dungeon make has a cost stuck to it. I may have a monopoly on the sweets market around here, but that doesn’t mean I’ve got a bottomless supply. It’d probably be in your best interest not to be too greedy.”The truth of the matter was that I had more than enough DP to get her three bags, but I didn’t want to let her have her way. Spoiling the damned lazy dragon rotten was the last thing I wanted to do.“How regrettable.” Lefi hung her head. Her voice was filled with genuine sadness. “It is unfortunate, but it appears that there is nothing more I can say to alter our circumstances. Very well, two bags it is.”I couldn’t help but feel sorry for her.“Look. Stop pouting. I’ll make it up to you by getting some cake ready for when you guys are done.”
“‘Keik’, you say? I’ve yet to hear of such a sweet. Wonderful, I cannot wait to learn its taste!” Lefi’s mood took a sudden turn for the better. “Come, girl. I shall instruct you on the so called ‘Bahthrum’ and its features. While it is a foreign concept, it is one that you shall never regret experiencing. The bath here is one of the most comfortable this world has to offer!”
“Got it, Leffers!”“Pffft!” I sprayed the water I was drinking all over the floor in front of me as I heard the vampire call the dragon by what could only be interpreted as a bizarre pet name.“L-Leffers!?” Lefi’s eyes went wide. “Youngling, do not refer to me in such a bizarre manner! You must respect your elders and address them appropriately. Refer to me by my name, Leficios!”
“Mmm… that’s kinda long, and it seems really distant.” The little girl frowned. “Can I just call you Lefi? I don’t know why, but it feels kinda like you’re my big sis or something, so I wanna give you a nickname!”
“…” The dragon paused for a moment to regain her senses. The girl’s words had totally blown her mind out of the water. “Very well. I shall allow it.”Heh. Looks like the girl’s already won Lefi over.And with that, Lefi headed to the bathroom, the little girl in tow.***[1] Unlike the bathrooms in North America, many Japanese bathrooms are just for bathing.Editor’s Note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, what a mammoth of a chapter, huh? Of course, Yuki was going to let Illuna stay as long as she wants in the dungeon. He may cuss like a sailor, but he’s got a good heart. At least, as long as you’re not a dick to the ones he loves and cares about. I’ll be honest, I was pissed too when I read what those creeps said to Illuna, and I hope Yuki manages to hunt the bastards down. But, you know what has to happen for that to happen, right? That’s right, more chapters. So, as always, see y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Let’s Roll a Gachapon!
Editor: JokerA full night’s rest was more than enough to allow Illuna to fully recover from the verge of death. In fact, she was so healthy that I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. At first, she’d almost looked like the child of some random hobo. She wore rags and was covered in so much blood, dirt, and filth that I didn’t realize that she was actually quite the looker. I now knew that the child had shiny blonde hair, big, brown round eyes, and a face pretty enough to put celebrities to shame. The height she stood at only added to her charm. She was just tall enough for me to feel the urge to pat her on the head whenever I saw her. Give her a few years, and I’m pretty sure every guy that sees her is gonna end up all over her.Lefi had told me that vampires and succubi were beautiful, but Illuna seemed more than just that. There was no way that she wasn’t well above average even taking her race into consideration. I’m pretty sure the kidnappers that raided her village thought the same, seeing as how they killed literally everyone else.Naturally, I’d replaced her rags with actual clothes. She was wearing a one piece dress that looked near identical to Lefi’s, with the biggest difference being that it was a good bit smaller. Their hair colours were different, and Lefi had both horns and a tail, but I couldn’t help but think that the two looked like a pair of sisters, especially when they stood next to each other. The biggest factor that played into it was that they were both undeniably beautiful.“Woah! What’s that!?” The vampire ran around the dungeon, curiously examining and asking about everything she saw.
“What? Oh, that? That’s the pop up pirate game.”
“The pop up pirate game? What’s that?”
“It’d be easier for you just to try it. You see those toy swords lying around where you found it?”
“Yeah?”
“Try sticking them through one of the holes in the barrel.”
“Okay!”Illuna followed my instructions and impaled poor Blackbeard with several plastic blades. Nothing happened at first, but she kept trying until the toy finally reacted. The plastic contraption made a bit of a clacking sound as the pirate was ejected from his barrel.“Woah!” Illuna grabbed Blackbeard and ran over to me. She held her prize up and spoke with a big smile, to which I responded in kind. “Did you see that, Yuki? The guy in the barrel went flying!”Dungeon life wasn’t exactly what I could call thrilling. Not much happened, and I didn’t really need to do any real work. My passive income was more than enough for the dungeon’s residents to live off of. I needed something to stave off both Lefi’s boredom and my own, so I’d bought a bunch of random, cheap stuff to keep us entertained.That said, the dragon girl refused to play the pop up pirate game. Our good friend Mr. Blackbeard had smacked her dead in the face the first time she got him to pop, so she’d avoided both him and his game ever since.After a few moments of watching over the young vampire with a smile, I sat myself down atop the throne and relaxed. By now, I was so used to the fancy chair that I no longer found it awkward to sit in. In fact, it was extremely comfortable. I popped open the menu and quickly checked over a few key stats.Hmm.. it looks like I’m actually earning quite a bit now. I kind of want to keep growing the dungeon’s territory, but at this point, I don’t really need all that extra passive income. It’s not like I’m going to need it unless I decide to save up for something super expensive. Which means… I can finally “have a little fun.”I’d always been interested in RNGesus’ bounty, but I’d refrained out of the concern that I was just going to be wasting DP. but I mean, it’s not like it’s really a waste. Honestly, all I’m doing is checking out my options. The gacha doesn’t say what it has, so giving it a few spins and finding out is clearly the most obvious and natural thing to do. I’m totally not actually giving in to temptation. Nope.After a bit of self justification, I tapped the gachapon tab and reviewed my options. The menu layout was simple. There were only four buttons. Each had a numeric value on it, designating its price. Let’s see… 100, 1k, 10k, 100k. The more expensive ones probably have better rates and prizes, but the 10k and 100k ones are a bit too rich for my blood. The one that costs 100 has probably only got junk in it, grand prize aside, so I guess I’ll stick with the 1k gacha for now.With that decided and out of the way, I tapped the button. Particles of glowing white light began gathering in front of me and gradually taking form, much as it had when I summoned Shii.“Is that… a pistol?” Huh. Neat.” The thing that formed in my hand was basically a scaled up derringer with a cylinder. Though I called it a pistol at first, I soon realized that it was more of an oddly shaped revolver. Pistols didn’t have cylinders, after all.Fancy engravings ran along both the gun’s barrel and its grip. Whoever engraved this thing has got some pretty good taste.After looking it over, I analyzed the weapon in order to see what it could do.***Magical Handgun: A ranged weapon that uses magical energy as ammunition. Its magazine can hold up to seven bullets.***“Wow. Not bad at all.” Admittedly, I found the weapon awesome. It was the type of gun that would’ve made me throw my wallet at the screen and mash the whale button if I saw it in a game with microtransactions. There was no doubting it. I’d won a pretty damn good prize. I was certain that it was one of the gacha’s rare drops.I wanted to test it right away, but I stopped myself short and instead continued to roll. There’s no point in testing it right now. I’m going to get more cool shit if I keep rolling, so I might as well wait and mess around with all of it at once later. Plus, it looks like I’m a good luck streak, so I should probably keep rolling before it goes away.***Oh god, why? Why didn’t I just stop after the stupid gun?A few minutes later, I found myself lamenting my choices. I’d rolled the gacha a tonne, and found myself staring down a pile of trash. My rolls had produced the followingPan Lid x 3
Dish Scrubber x 2
Soap Bar x 2
Wooden Cup x 1
Some Sort of Cloth x 1
Bottle of Salt x 2
Wooden Spoon x 1
Spool of Hemp x 1
Stuffed Animal x 1
Tupperware Container x 1
Finger Puppet x 1
Plastic Bag x 1
Keyholder x 1
Pencil x 1
Some Sort of Cord x 1Each and every single member of the veritable heap of garbage sitting in front of the throne was worth less than 100 DP.I can’t believe I just fell for Gambler’s Fallacy. Hook, Line, and Sinker at that… God damn it. I kept telling myself that my bad luck streak was going to end, and that I was going to hit the jackpot sooner or later. Evidently, I was wrong. Ugh… I forgot that my luck is even worse than Shii’s. And Shii is a god damn slime. A slime! The weakest monster there is! I swear, this stupid thing’s rigged to hell and back. It must’ve only spat out that gun because it was my first roll and it wanted to bait me into rolling more. Shit. Stupid “random” number generator led me by the nose. And like, why’s the most common thing gotta be a fucking pan lid!? What the hell am I going to do with 3 god damned lids!? It didn’t even get any pans! Like, come on! Why couldn’t the most common item at least be some sort of consumable I could actually get some value out of? Why’s it gotta be something this god damn useless?I sighed as I lifelessly leaned back into the throne. Just seeing the trash pile made me feel dumb and unmotivated. The action caught Illuna’s attention and prompted her to ask me a question.“What’s that weird blue thing?” She pointed straight towards the screen I’d been manipulating just a few moments prior.
“Oh, this? This is the dungeon’s menu. I use it to c—wait.” I cut myself off. “You can see this?”My response had been reflexive, so I hadn’t thought much about her question until after I’d started responding.“Yup! It’s weird, glowing, and kinda transparent!” The vampire said with a smile.Wait, what the hell? Wasn’t I supposed to be the only person that could actually see the menu? Not even Lefi could last time I checked, so why can Illuna?“I wanna try doing what you’re doing. It looks really fun!”
“Uhhhh… Sure. But just once, okay?” Can’t have her falling for Gambler’s Fallacy. Not that I have the DP for it.
“Yay! Thanks Yuki!” The vampire skipped over to the throne, climbed up my knees, and sat herself down in my lap. “Uhmm… So how do I make stuff come out?”
“You see this button?”
“The second one from the top?”
“Yeah. Poke it with your finger.”
“Okay!” Illuna happily tapped the floating screen.Light flooded the throne room. There were far more glowing particles than there’d been on any other occasion. In fact, there was enough to dye the entire throne room in blinding light.“Holy crap.” My eyes felt like they were about to bulge out of their sockets.
“Wow, it’s so pretty!”So many of the light particles had gathered that they didn’t even immediately take a solid shape. I could make out that whatever the gacha was spitting out had four legs and a tail, but that was it.Once the light finally vanished, it left behind a living thing, a creature whose massive frame towered a full head above my own. It was covered from head to toe in a layer of white fur that shone with all the lustre of a fresh coat of snow. Jagged claws extended from all four of its feet, each sharp enough to slice even a boulder in two. Its gaze, which was focused on us, was one that seemed to convey intelligence. I could tell that the creature, the wolf, could think. That it was no mere beast. My overall impression was that the canine gave off an aura of dignity and grace.The only word to describe Illuna’s pull was one that embodied luck itself: jackpot. I was so shocked to see the prize that my jaw dropped and froze in place.***General Information

It’d probably outclass me if we were the same level. In fact, it’s already more agile than me. It’s got all sorts of skills, and its class is ridiculous too. Like holy hell. It’s already Lord of the Wolves even though it was literally just born?“Wow! It’s a really big wolf!” Illuna squealed, got off my knees, and ran towards the wolf.
“Wait! Hold up!” I immediately ran after the little girl and attempted to stop her. Ohhh crap. It’s totally going to eat her.Fortunately, I was wrong. The giant wolf seemed to recognize us as its masters. It didn’t mind Illuna attaching herself to its leg. In fact, it even leaned forward and lowered its gaze to demonstrate that it was tame.“Wow, it’s so soft!”
“You sure are brave, Illuna. What would you’ve done if it attacked you?”
“It doesn’t smell like a bad wolf, so it’s okay!”Uh…what? Is that just a vampire thing? It doesn’t look like she’s got any skills that tell her whether something is dangerous, but she seems really confident, so…Shii, who wasn’t doing anything in particular, approached the fenrir. The slime stood in front of the wolf and bounced around, as if giving it a lecture. Though it wasn’t actually saying anything, I felt as if it was telling the newcomer that it would show him the ropes. The overall impression I got was that Shii was effectively acting no different from a kid puffing up its chest and bragging.Despite being way stronger, the Fenrir didn’t mind that a mere slime was treating it like it was higher up the social ladder. In fact, it almost seemed like the wolf was intently listening to everything the slime had to say. If you could call it that.Wow. That’s uh, one helluva mature attitude. Damn, Fenrir-bro. You a real man.“What an outrageous creature to summon,” Lefi grumbled as she dragged herself over. She’d been asleep, indulging in laziness, but all the commotion had eventually forced her out of bed.
“Yeah, I figured. It sure does look decently strong, huh?”
“Your description is inadequate. It does not even begin to capture the creature’s potential. The fenrir you have summoned is young, a mere pup. It has not yet realised its full strength,” said Lefi, matter of factly. “It will be like me once it matures, a creature of which legends are sung. I have fought just one in the past, and it was so difficult to defeat that I wished not to ever encounter another.” [1]
“Holy shit.” It’s that strong? I can’t believe that even Lefi acknowledges it. Wait, did she just say this one’s still a puppy? Even though it’s already bigger than I am? I was a bit concerned about the wolf’s final size. Hopefully it’ll at least be small enough to comfortably fit inside the throne room.“I must admit, I am quite impressed with both Shii and the girl. Neither is flinching in the face of such a creature. I would not be surprised to find both maturing into individuals of great influence and power.”I know, right?***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, is Illuna a little luck charm, or what? Pulling a FENRIR for 1k DP. What a steal. Although, it is kind of weird that she can see the dungeon’s menu. Wonder what the deal is with that? Well, hopefully it’ll be explained soon. Not much to say today, so sorry if anyone was looking forward to that. See y’all in the next chapter![1] This whole thing is a low key Pokemon reference. Paraphrasing here, but Arcanine is a canine known as the “Legendary Pokemon.” Its signature move (before other Pokemon stole it) was Extreme Speed.<– Prev — Next –>

A Detailed Inspection
Editor: Joker“Oh yeah, Lefi.” I began to speak to the dragon girl as I watched Illuna and Shii ride Rir around the throne room.
“Yes? What is it?”
“Can you see this?” I pointed at the screen I had pulled up in front of me.
“If you are referring to your status, then the answer is no. I cannot.”
“Nah, I’m talking about the dungeon’s menu. You see, it’s this thing that…” I gave her a quick overview of the dungeon’s features.
“I see. So it is the dungeon that provides you the ability to synthesize the mysterious objects you so often spawn.”
“Yeah, pretty much.” I nodded as I leaned back into the throne. “So you see, thing is, Iunno why, but Illuna can see it too.”
“And I presume that you wish for me to explain why that is the case?”
“Pretty much, yeah.”
“While I lack a grasp of the precise reason, I can describe a difference between the girl and I, a difference that may bear a relation to the knowledge you seek.”
“Sure, explain away.”
“The difference is that she has engaged you in matrimony, whereas I have not.”
“Uhh… What?” My voice distorted out of sheer confusion.I immediately turned to face the dragon girl so I could check over her expression, but her face didn’t betray even the slightest hint of amusement. She was dead serious. Bro. What? You’ve gotta be kidding me.“Blood is one of the body’s most crucial elements.” She took the baffled look on my face as a prompt to continue speaking. “Taking the blood of another into one’s own body—engaging in an exchange of bodily fluids—is none other than an act of intercourse.”
“You serious…?”
“Indeed. Most that belong to the vampire race consider the sucking of blood to be equivalent to union between partners, tying the knot, as they say. Of course, there exist members of their species with a lesser degree of integrity. These individuals will take blood from those with which they are not particularly intimate with, but they are far outside the norm. Many judge them as men and women without integrity, individuals that have lost their moral compass. Most members of the species only suck blood from those that they hold strong affection for.”Bro. What? Like. What? I don’t even. Is this real life? Or is it just fantasy? [E1]“B-But isn’t blood just supposed to be food? L-Like, vampires need that shit, right? And it’s not like they could all be married at all points in time. What the hell do single vampires eat?”
“You are correct. Vampires do indeed require blood for sustenance. That, however, is all they require. They require not the blood of any particular species. Even the blood of an animal will suffice, and that is precisely what unwed vampires consume.” Lefi paused for a moment. “I suspect that the girl was not yet taught the precise significance of sucking the blood of another. That, however, is not to say that her instincts have not provided her a rough idea of the act’s nature. Rejoice. She is young, but the affection she holds for you is true. Her desire for your bodily fluids stems from the depths of her heart.”Uhh… I was so blown away by what I’d just learned that it took me a moment to process everything. “Wait… If you knew all this, then why didn’t you tell me earlier!? Why’d you just sit around and let it happen!?”
“It was for your sake. I know that you bear a lust for children and that you have always longed to join one as young as her in matrimony.”
“What the fuck!?”
“I very vividly recall feeling your gaze resting upon my flesh when I first took this form. Your desires were and still remain self-evident and clear as day.”
“T-That’s just a misunderstanding! I was not staring!” I screamed indignantly. Where the hell did all this come from!? It’s not true, I swear, officer! Wait a second! I quickly pulled up the dungeon’s menu as I came to a sudden realization. Specifically, I opened up a detailed display that contained information regarding everything in the dungeon and reported the amount of DP it generated a day. I scrolled right past Lefi and the ridiculous amount of income she provided and checked up on our resident vampire. I knew it! She’s no longer generating any DP.Even the children of lesser monsters like goblins provided me a net daily income of 3 dungeon points. But Illuna, like Shii, was giving a flat zero. In other words, the dungeon thought of her as not an intruder, but a friendly unit that posed no more of a threat to it than its very own monsters.“Ugh… What the hell…?” I groaned. “Why did that have to be the one time you actually tried not to be selfish? I swear to god…”
“Whatever is that supposed to mean!?” Lefi cried resentfully. “I would not have remained silent if I knew not that it was for your sake. I made a choice in your best interests, yet you have done little but complain!”
“And I’m telling you that you should’ve just minded your own goddamn business! In fact, you know what? No more sweets for you, not for a whole three days!”
“What absolute tyranny! I firmly protest the motion! You cannot do this to me without good reason!”I ignored Lefi, who’d started to noisily complain, heaved a heavy sigh, and began to think. Illuna had yet to ask me for any more blood. In fact, she apparently didn’t need any for a whole week. Normal food was enough to satisfy her in the meantime. Alright. You know what? Let’s just do the thing. Yeah. I’mma just put this off and call it future Yuki’s problem. I mean, I’m happy she likes me so much, but she’s just a kid. This whole thing is probably puppy love at best. There’s no doubt I’m going to have to end up raising her. She’ll probably never shut up about how much she hates me and how gross I am the moment she hits puberty. Wait. Imagining that is just making me sad. God damn it. Why am I doing this to myself?I coughed and faked clearing my throat before continuing my mental monologue, albeit in a bit less confident a tone. I-I mean, there’s no way to know how she’ll feel for sure without waiting for her to grow up, so I’mma just put this whole fiasco off until she does by feigning ignorance. I mean, why would anyone expect me of all people to know anything about vampire culture. Mhmm. Yup.Again, I heaved a sigh. I might put some more real thought into all this if she still likes me when she’s older. But not now.***I decided to check out my new toy, or rather, my new weapon, after I finished brooding on the whole Illuna situation. Magically enhanced weapon in hand, I headed out of the throne room and ventured through the cave that enclosed it.I was once again greeted by the magnificent forest, a sight that left my heart pounding every single time I saw it. Today, however, was a bit different. My heart had already started throbbing by the time I left the cave. I was so excited to finally fire the magical handgun that the scenery felt bland in comparison. I died before ever getting to touch one of these babies back in my old world, so I’d always assumed that I’d never have the chance to wield one. Wait, does this even count as a real gun? I’m not really sure how it holds up in terms of technicalities, but I guess it probably counts since it’s got gun in its name.I poured my mana, which I’d only recently gotten better at controlling, into the weapon. I made sure to go slow and kept an eye on my status screen as I did. I wasn’t too used to the feel yet, so I had to use the UI to figure out exactly how much mana I was using.After draining exactly ten mana, I stopped channeling and pointed the gun at a sturdy looking rock situated in front of me. I reproduced the stance I often saw people take in movies and pulled the trigger.The gun bounced backwards with the slightest bit of recoil as its firing mechanism activated. Its projectile, a small glob of mana, cut through the air. A low ring resounded a moment later as the projectile smashed itself against the rock.I ran up to the large stone and traced my finger across the evident bullet mark. The projectile had been powerful enough to chip a piece off the large stone. Wait, this stuff gets stronger if I put more mana into it, right? I began to concentrate even more magical energy into my gun. Heh. Time for some science.***I ended up running five different experiments. First, I put another ten mana into the gun and confirmed that it was consistent and produced a similar result. I then tried four other denominations, specifically one hundred, five hundred, a thousand, and five thousand.The bullet that ate a hundred mana was powerful enough to not only chip the rock, but create a small hole. The bullet with five times that amount, however, was able to drill through to the other side. The bullet containing a thousand mana produced a much larger projectile than all the other bullets. It managed to eat into the rock and blow a good chunk of it away. The final projectile, in which I invested five thousand MP, produced a massive laser that not only completely incinerated the rock, but also flattened thirty odd meters of the terrain that lay behind it.All in all, the gun was powerful enough to render me silent. It was an even better weapon than I’d initially anticipated. I ended up kinda unhappy because I kept getting shit rolls, but honestly, I don’t even mind anymore. Like, seriously. Worth.A part of me is tempted to charge all my mana into a single bullet, but uh, I’m pretty sure that’s just a recipe for disaster. I don’t even think the weapon’s designed to take that much mana. The barrel was shaking mad hard with just 5k. Not that I’ll ever need all 5k. In fact, I highly doubt I’ll ever even need a thousand. God damn.My magical handgun could hold seven bullets at once, and each could contain a different amount of mana. I could totally fire something with just 10 mana to lure someone into thinking the weapon’s a total dud, then hit them with a 1k bullet and pull the rug from under their feet. That said, I’m pretty sure that I’d probably be able to achieve the exact same result if I brute forced it with like 3k mana right off the bat.Another interesting aspect of the gun was that any mana stored inside the gun would stay inside the gun. Gazing at it with my magic eye allowed me to confirm that it didn’t leak energy, and that I could theoretically keep it loaded as long as I wanted. But uh, that’s probably a bad idea. I’m honestly kinda scared I might unintentionally discharge the damn thing and blow a hole in my leg. Or worse. So uhhh, yeah no. I’mma keep it empty ‘til I need it.I placed the gun in my item box as I shuddered at the thought of accidentally shooting myself. A large creature slowly lumbered out of the dungeon and approached me right as I finished.“Oh, hey. Looks like Illuna finally let you go. You did good work. Must’ve been exhausting.”The dungeon’s second monster, the Fenrir, which, by the way, happened to be male, plopped himself down beside me. A single glance was enough to tell that it was tired. Yeah, I would be too. Bro just had to play with both Illuna and Shii with Lefi throwing a tantrum as background noise. Unsurprisingly, hearing that she was banned from consuming sweets had caused the dragon girl to fall into the depths of despair. She’d been reduced to a ball of noise that did naught but whine and complain.The white wolf whimpered and bowed its head after taking a seat. But, rather than complaining, it felt more like it was saying something along the lines of “all in a day’s work, sir.”That interaction alone was enough to give me a grasp of the wolf’s personality. I understood that it was the type of guy that was prepared for anything and everything that life would throw at him. Damn. This dude’s got balls. Of course, the wolf didn’t literally speak to me. I just somehow managed to grasp its intent, the same way I could somehow kind of understand Shii. It seemed that that was just how things worked. It was evident that the dungeon had some sort of mechanism that allowed us to establish a sort of mutual understanding. Unfortunately, it was imperfect. I could only roughly understand him, but it was good enough. The same system seemed to apply between monsters. I’d happened to see Shii communicating with him in a similar manner just a bit earlier.Of course, we didn’t leave our newfound canine companion unnamed. Illuna had christened the wolf Fluffrir. Apparently, she’d chosen it because he was fluffy and a fenrir. His status page naturally reflected this new name of his. The blank had been replaced and updated. A part of me felt kind of bad for Fluffrir. Illuna had only given him such a weird name because I’d told her his species. Yeah uh… Fluffrir doesn’t really sound right. I guess I’ll just cut it short and call him Rir.“Oh yeah. You mind showing me your unique skills?”Rir had a total of seven skills, three of which were unique. I more or less knew exactly what his regular did, but I was just dying to see his uniques.The wolf complied. He got up and started to activate his abilities one by one. They were all fairly interesting. Extreme Speed allowed him to momentarily raise his speed to the point where I could no longer see him. Everchanging Chains allowed him to materialize and freely manipulate a series of chains. The chains could both become thicker and more durable if he chose to invest more mana. Finally, Transformation allowed him to alter his size. He could get both bigger and smaller, with his smallest form being the size of a regular wolf. Oh nice. I guess I won’t have to worry about him actually fitting in places.“Shit. That’s awesome dude.” I was impressed. The most eye catching skill was the one that involved chains. It had a ridiculous amount of utility. It was possible for the wolf to shield himself, create footholds in midair, and even tie up his foes. It was the type of skill whose power was only really limited by creativity. I want that. Too bad it’s unique. It’d probably cost a metric ton of DP to get, assuming it’s even in the shop.Hearing my praise caused the wolf to happily perk up. I couldn’t really tell from his expression, but his tail was very clearly wagging back and forth.“…”Seeing him like that led me to develop an urge, one I immediately followed up on by opening the dungeon’s menu. I instantly bought a familiar looking item, raised it, and called out to Rir.“Hey Rir! You see this? Fetch!”I threw the disk shaped toy, the frisbee, and urged the wolf to chase it down. Rir seemed a bit hesitant about the whole idea at first, but he eventually lost to his instincts. He dashed after it, caught it in midair, and brought it right back.“Good boy! Alright, round two!”I grabbed the frisbee again, mustered up all the might invested in me as demon lord, and chucked it as hard as I could. Rir once again chased it down and returned. But this time, he was too excited to come to a stop.“Wahaha! Wait! Hold up! Slow down! Blraaghgh!”He playfully tackled me to the ground.“You’ve done it now!” I smirked as I reached up towards the oversized dog and started to play with it.***“Whew. God damn. Dem Fenrir things doe..” I lay on the floor, panting heavily as I said something that not even I really understood. My mind was too frazzled to actually process coherent thoughts.You know. I’ve always been more of a cat person, but playing with Rir’s made me think that dogs are cute too. Not that he’s actually a dog, but you know, whatever.Speaking of, the young wolf was laying down right next to me. He was on all fours, with his stomach on the ground and his head hung low. He seemed to be distressed by the fact that he’d given in to his instincts. A clear aura of self loathing emanated from his body. Hmm… I guess letting his instincts control him must’ve hurt his pride a bit. As far as I’m concerned though, it’s a good thing. Who cares, so long as you have fun, right?More importantly though, this whole experience had really reaffirmed that Illuna’s one hell of a girl. Like holy crap. The amount of luck you’d need to actually roll this damn thing. Fenrirs were powerful beasts. The fastest way to find them in the dungeon’s catalogue was to sort by price and start scrolling down from the top of the list.And not to mention that Rir’s even got powerful unique skills. I mean, he’s not too strong right now, but one day, he might end up growing as powerful as the fenrir Lefi fought. Dude’s got hella potential.“Oh yeah, Rir, you know how the dungeon’s mana systems work, right?”The wolf raised his head and nodded.“Alright then, listen up. Everything above where we are right now is Lefi’s domain. But most of the stuff under it is the dungeon’s territory. My territory. I’d like you to live down there and hunt monsters and stuff.”Unlike Shii, Rir wasn’t just a pet. He was a monster strong enough to defend himself. Some of his stats were even higher than mine, so I couldn’t just let him laze around. I decided to have him work and help me earn DP. Heh. I’ll work you hard, boy. Git stronk so I can just sit back, relax, and just enjoy life.“But uh, hunting stuff aside, you can pretty much just do whatever you want. I’ll come visit you from time to time so we can play, hang out, and kill stuff together. Oh, and don’t forget to stop by every once in a while, ‘kay? Illuna’ll probably cry if you don’t.”You’re one of us, Rir. I know we just summoned you, but this right here? This is your home. You’ll always be welcome here.Understanding my intent, the wolf lowered its head in a deep bow.***[E1] I’d say Beelzebub has a devil set aside for you in hell, lolicon. >_> (Bohemian Rhapsody lyrics in case no one knows) ← This is an editor’s note.Editor’s Note: Hey guys! Joker here. Another early chapter down. This one dealt with the ramifications of Illuna actually drinking our demon lord’s blood. Boy, was he shocked or what? Hah, what a dumbass. If it were me, if Lefi was acting coy like that, I’d ask her what was up before doing anything. Lack of information in this world could get you into real trouble one day, rookie. Not that I can talk. Heh. And of course, we learn just how much of a badass Rir actually is. But really. Fluffrir? I think I’d just have to take the single bullet’s way out if I was named that. But Rir is a loyal Fenrir, so I guess that’s not an option. Hey, look at that. My mojo’s back. Just in time for my work week to burn it away. *sigh* Well, whatever. It’s food on the table and internet in my laptop, I guess. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Wings Please
Editor: Joker
“Holy shit! I found it! I can’t believe I finally found it!” I shouted like a madman as I stood up from my throne. The abruptness of the action led both Illuna, who’d been playing nearby, and Shii, who’d been sitting on my lap, to each give me a look. The former was gazing upon me curiously, as if wondering what’d suddenly gotten me so riled up. The latter, however, seemed to regard my action with resentment. My sudden shift had displaced the slime from its perch and knocked it onto the ground.I would’ve apologized, but I was too preoccupied to notice the slime’s displeasure. All my attention had been directed towards the thing I’d just found.“Hahaha… Mwahahahahah…! Mwaaahahahahahaha!” I laughed three times, with each lasting longer and sounding more sinister than the last. Only after I finished did I finally shout a slightly distorted version of a quote from a famous manga. “I reject my humanity, J*jo, and the inability to fly that comes with it!”With that said, I left the throne room, cackling like a deranged psychopath as I went on my way.Of course, I hadn’t actually lost my mind. I was still perfectly sane and in control. The reason I’d suddenly burst into a fit of joyous laughter was because I’d finally found one of the things I’d been looking for since I first became a demon lord.I spotted it because I decided to look for Everchanging Chains, the overly convenient skill that Rir had shown me the other day. I suspected that the skill was in the catalogue, so I went through the unique skill section and looked for it, only to do a double take as a certain other skill caught my eye. A skill that would allow me to lift my feet off the ground and ascend to the heavens.Flight.At first, I’d actually thought that the skill just didn’t exist. It wasn’t in the list of regular skills, and I hadn’t expected it to be a unique skill. Moreover, Lefi had told me that, to her, flying was just something natural. It wasn’t a skill. It was just something that she had always been able to do. From that, I’d come to the conclusion that flight wasn’t a skill.But my guess was off the mark. And never before had I been happier to be wrong.I tapped the purchase button the moment I saw the skill. It was an impulse buy. I didn’t care that it cost more than ten times what regular skills cost. The fact that it ate two thirds of the DP I had on hand was just flat out irrelevant.Because I was a man, a man with fantasies that burned with all the passion of a fiery star, a man that knew in his heart that chasing his dreams was the one true way to live his life. I had to follow in the footsteps of the king of the pirates and leave the nest to set sail in pursuit of my ambitions. As any real man would.That was why I had made the transaction without hesitation. Lefi’ll probably chew me out for this if she ever finds out since I always try to discourage her from wasting DP, but I doubt she will. It’s not like there’s any way for her to know how much anything costs. None of the excitement pumping through my veins waned as I materialized the wings I normally kept hidden away. I still can’t tell if these are supposed to be bat wings or dragon wings, but whatever. Doesn’t matter.In my past life, the thought of having jet black wings would’ve made me flash a wry smile at best. But now, they were more than just an edgy joke. They were a reality. My reality. From my back extended a pair of appendages so dark in colour that they almost seemed reminiscent of a bottomless void.Though I had wings, they hadn’t been of any use. At worst, they were in the way. And at best, they were decorative. They may as well have been part of some sort of weird cosplay. But all that was going to change. For they had finally gained purpose.My wings were going to graduate from uselessness and become powerful vehicles capable of ferrying me into the sky and taking me wherever I pleased. Finally. It’s finally time to liberate myself from the confines of the ground and experience nature from a whole new angle. It’s time to soar, to gain freedom and everything that lies beyond.“Alright! Let’s go! Beyond the great blue!” As I shouted, I tensed my wings and urged them to flap.………………Uhm… What the actual fuck…?Nothing happened. Nothing changed, no matter how long I waited. My wings refused to respond to my will. Rather, they failed to fulfill my wishes. They were flapping just the slight bit back and forth, but that was it. They weren’t actually producing lift. Alright, you know what? I’ll just… give it another shot.“Alright… Let’s go! Beyond the great blue!” I took a deep breath and repeated myself with yet another energetic shout. But again, nothing happened. The sky continued to remain far outside my grasp.“W-What the fuck!?” My jaw dropped in disbelief. I didn’t understand what was going on. I mean, the skill’s working. I know that much for sure. It’s a bit hard to explain, but I can feel it. It’s kind of like how I can tell that my arms are moving when I swing them around, or how I just know when I’ve closed my eyes, even in total darkness.But, even though the skill was active, I couldn’t lift off.“What the fuck!? Why isn’t it working!?” I tried jumping around and flapping my wings in a manner reminiscent of an immature chick trying to leave the nest. I repeated the actions until I found myself out of breath and exhausted, but never once did I ever truly leave the ground.Was I just… not meant to fly? I grimaced as my internal monologue made a turn for the worse. It might just be one of those things. Like how you can’t make a dog cook even if you somehow get it to learn the skill. I might just not have what it takes.All the excitement I had built up drained from my body as my mood plunged all the way down to rock bottom; a single negative thought was all it took to take me from a record high to a record low.I turned my eyes up to the sky above and observed it in all its splendor. Looking at it like this almost makes it seem… cruel. It’s right there. Right before my eyes. But I just can’t reach it, no matter how hard I try. God damn it. I guess this whole flight thing really was just a pipe dream after all. All remaining hope drained from my system. It was as if some cruel mastermind had pulled a curtain of despair right over my eyes, and I’d remained none the wiser until the very last moment. Reality weighed down on my shoulders and caused me to collapse. I fell onto my hands and knees and hung my head in resignation.I had failed not only myself, but also my passion. My dream had hit a dead end, a brick wall, an invisible ceiling. And there was nothing I could do about it.God damn it, Yuki! What the hell are you doing!? Get ahold of yourself, you dumbass! It’s too early to cast aside your dreams. Right as I was about to give in, words of encouragement bubbled up from somewhere deep inside of me. That’s right. I can’t give up just yet. Brick wall? Invisible ceiling? Fuck, bring it on. I don’t care what needs to be done. I will fly.After taking a deep breath to calm myself down, I began to reevaluate my options. Let’s see… Flight’s a unique skill, so it hasn’t got any levels in it. But that doesn’t mean that knowing the skill is really all I need to do to understand and master it. It’ll probably start working if I just git gud, so I guess I’ll go pick the brain of someone who knows how flight works. Good thing I’ve got just the right person in mind, huh?***“And that is why you have come to beg for my grace?” The dragon girl narrowed her eyes as she watched me prostrate myself before her.
“That’s exactly it.” I said. “Please, Your Scaliness, lend me your knowledge. Teach me your almighty ways. You’re my last hope.”
“This subservient act of yours is revolting, Yuki,” replied Lefi, her face twisted into a frown. “Have you already forgotten the injustice you subjected me to? You robbed me of the sweets I adored and forced upon me the miserable, sugarless taste of despair for three days and three nights. Do you truly believe that a mere shift in attitude would suffice to right your wrongdoings? Preposterous! What ridiculous conceit!”
“Alright, alright. I get that you’re unhappy,” I said, reverting to my usual tone. “Look, I’ll make it up to you. How about I lick your feet?”
“Lick my feet!?” Lefi shrunk back in disgust. “You would go that far?”Ey mang, I wants ta fly. Ain’t nothin’ finna stop me. I dismissed Lefi’s question by speaking to myself in a funny dialect.There was nothing wrong with desperately wanting to fly. It wasn’t an uncommon desire. In fact, it’d been a common one that had crept up throughout my old world’s history. People had always wanted to fly. And machines, airplanes, had indeed been a realization of that exact dream. But alas, the metal contraptions had failed to truly fulfill it. What mankind truly wished for was to soar through the skies with none other than their very own flesh and blood—an act that, in this world, was actually possible. I didn’t care what I needed to do. I was going to fly. I wasn’t about to pass up the opportunity to fulfill one of my species’ oldest desires.“Desperate or not, Yuki, you must know that all things in this realm come at a price.” The dragon girl brought her thumb and index finger together to form a circle. In Japan, such a gesture would clearly have referred to cold, hard cash. Japanese coins, modern and ancient alike, often featured circular forms with hollowed out centers. But of course, Lefi knew nothing of Japan and its culture. And although she’d hinted at an exchange of currency, she didn’t desire wealth. What she wanted was a fried pastry with a hole punched out its center. A donut. Seriously? Is that really all she wants? The request she made was incredibly easy to fulfill, so I decided to take it a step further and grab her something a bit fancier. I searched through the dungeon’s catalogue until I found a pack that came with a nice, white, paper box.“How fragrant!” Lefi exclaimed. She slowly lifted the paper box’s lid as carefully as she would that of a treasure chest. “How incredible! There are three whole servings!? I cannot believe it! Each is a different flavour from the last, and all three bear a powerful aesthetic charm. Their appearances truly serve to function as a testament to their quality.”Her eyes had shot wide open; the look she gave me was one of joyous disbelief.There was no denying that the donuts I handed the dragon girl were more expensive than usual, but that was only because I normally cheaped out and got her the least costly type there was. At most, they would have cost me about six hundred yen back in Japan. Yet, she was treating them like they were made of solid gold. It was evident that her common sense as one of this world’s residents had led her to believe that sugar was extremely expensive. It was a reasonable conclusion. That was how it used to be back in my old world too. Sugar had started off as a luxury, something that only the well off could afford.In other words, Lefi believed that the donuts I spawned her had come at an incredible cost. It was for that reason that she was regarding me as she would a generous saint. This is making me feel a bit guilty… It’s almost like I scammed her or something.“Here, you know what, take this too.” I presented her another sweet as a bit of an added bonus. Mostly to curb my own guilt.
“Unbelievable!” cried Lefi. “Is that perhaps the fabled Kast-Ellah!?”Again, her eyes opened wide. Huh. She thinks castella is the stuff of legends? Oh. Must be because I only ever bought it once. I never bothered getting it a second time because I thought she cared more about quantity than quality. Yeah uhhh… whoops. Didn’t realize she liked them that much.“I am amazed, Yuki. I am amazed to see the man that does naught but grumble and complain prepare such a magnificent feast.” Lefi placed a hand on her chest and nodded. “Very well. I see now the extent of your ardor. I will forgive you and forget the incident in which you refused to quell my hunger and transform you into one that rules over the sky. Of course, I shall remain its Supreme Overlord, but you too will become one of its masters. I shall make you none other than the Skylord.”
“Skylord? Sounds good to me.” I nodded, handed her the castella, and sealed the deal. Huh. She seems pretty attached to that Supreme Overlord title.
“Wait! That’s no fair!” Illuna, who had watched our conversation unfold, pitter pattered over as she raised her voice in objection. “I wanna eat sweets too!”
“Listen well, Illuna. I shall impart upon you an important life lesson,” said Lefi. She twisted her lips into a cocky, shit-eating grin as she directed her gaze at the young vampire. “It is only natural for me to be the sole consumer of the sweets that I was granted. They were goods I gained in an equal exchange. I offered my labour, the transfer of my knowledge, and received them in return. If you too wish for sweets, then you must do the very same. Those that do not work have no right to eat.”That’s real rich coming from someone that does nothing but eat and sleep all day… Hearing her led me to immediately think of a retort, but I refrained from voicing it in the interest of preserving her mood. She might go back on her word if I piss her off too much.“Fine!” said Illuna as she turned to me. “Can you give me work, Yuki? I really want sweets too!”
“Hmmm, alright. Help me make dinner tonight, and I’ll pass you a plate of dessert. How’s that sound?”At first, all our food had come from trading in DP, but I soon started growing sick of ordering stuff off the dungeon’s catalogue. The fact that it was ready by the time I hit the button made me feel like I was eating fast food every single day. That was why I’d purchased the kitchen. Having the facility allowed us to make our food. And by us, I meant me.Lefi wasn’t exactly the type to cook. She was far too lazy and I somehow doubted that she even knew how. Illuna, on the other hand, had helped out in the kitchen at home, so she at least kind of knew what she was doing. That said, she was still young, so I didn’t want her to handle anything major. Most of her tasks ended up being something along the lines of peeling the leaves off a stalk of lettuce. Thus, by process of elimination, cooking duty ended up falling onto my shoulders.I wasn’t all that great at cooking. I couldn’t make anything too special, but repeating the task had caused it to grow on me. The task was surprisingly entertaining. Or at the very least, much more fun than I gave it credit for.“Okay! I’ll do my best!” said Illuna.
“I admit…” said Lefi. “Dessert does indeed have quite the ring to it.”
“I mean, the same rules that apply to her apply to you,” I said. “You can have dessert too, so long as you help out in the kitchen.”
“…” Lefi’s face twisted into a frown as she took a moment to think the idea over. “It is fine. I will refrain.”Her response caused a wry smile to show up on my face. Looks like her sweet tooth only comes second to her laziness.***Editor’s note: Hey guys! Joker here. Well, looks like our resident demon lord finally got his wings the potential to work. Now he just needs to figure out how to use them. If I were him, I’d probably jump out of a tree or something. Either I learn to fly, or I twist my ankle. Seems like decent motivation to me. Wonder what Lefi’s going to do. Also, depending on when the boss releases this and if you celebrate it or not, Happy Thanksgiving! May your turkeys be big and basted, the potatoes be warm and creamy, and the company happy and relaxing. Eat, drink, make merry, but don’t drink and drive. Otherwise, you won’t find out how any of these stories end. Plus, I’ll really miss seeing the hits on the site drop off. (can’t actually see the hits on the site, but likes it as a motivation to not drink and drive. ^^) See y’all in the next chapter, or when you wake up from your food coma!<– Prev — Next –>

Wings Please – Part 2
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix
Lefi and I left Illuna in charge of the house as the two of us ventured outdoors.“Ugh…” The first thing the dragon girl did as she stepped into Mother Nature’s realm was groan and narrow her eyes. “It has been many a day since I last saw the light of the sun.”
“That is kind of what tends to happen when you shut yourself indoors all day,” I said with a shrug. Despite being the “Supreme Dragon,” Lefi was incredibly lazy. She had never left the dungeon except for when she felt like stretching her limbs or going on a hunt. And, while the latter at least sounded respectable, it was by no means something she could brag about. Every single hunt she went on was fueled by gluttony and gluttony alone. She would always strongarm me into buying her higher end sweets once she was done by stating that she had helped me earn enough DP to justify them.In other words, she was on the verge of falling into depravity and joining the legions of NEETs who did nothing but mooch and laze their days away. Wait. Just how the hell is she not actually morbidly obese? All she ever does is eat, sleep, and play around in ways that don’t require moving in any which way. The stuff she eats is sugary as hell and super high calorie too. If I was her, I’d probably be bloated enough to be considered a land whale and a half by now. Well, she is a dragon after all, so it makes sense that she’d be able to eat like one. Must be nice to be able to eat all you want while still keeping thin…I couldn’t help but frown as I was once again forced to realize that she truly did reign supreme. And in more ways than one, at that.“Oh yeah, didn’t you have a nest or something? You sure it’s okay for you not to check up on it every once in a while?”
“I’ve no longer a need for it. It was a territory I procured solely for the quality of its honey. However, as I have now acquired a means of consuming sweet foods of an even higher quality, I no longer consider it a thing of value. I mind not bestowing it upon you such that you can claim it as your own.”Seriously? THAT was why you lived there? God damn it Lefi, why did I ever expect anything else from you? God. Now I feel stupid for trying to be all considerate. I even went out of my way not to extend the dungeon up the mountain.I gave Lefi a bit of a miffed frown, but soon ended up just shrugging my shoulders and heaving a sigh. Yeah, no point getting mad. She’s always been like this. I don’t think I’ve ever really thought of her as anything more than just one big disappointment. The final expression I ended up wearing before materializing my wings was a wry smile.“I… am impressed” Lefi gulped. “Your wings are quite the splendid sight to behold.” She started fidgeting as she repeatedly glanced at and away from my wings. The hell’s up with her?
“Yeah, they kinda get in the way, so I normally just keep them tucked awargh!?” I jumped in response to a sudden bit of stimulus. “W-What the hell!? Stop touching them! That tickles!”The dragon girl reached towards my wings yet again even though I’d just backed away from her, so I ended up having to twist my body to avoid her hands. Wait, I can feel stuff through them? Aren’t they just made up of mana? Hmmm… I guess materializing them must give them some sort of physical substance.I had to escape Lefi’s hands several times before she finally gave up.“They are quite magnificent,” she muttered despondently. “Hiding them is wasteful. You would do best to leave them out for the world to behold.”Magnificent? Seriously? Dragons sure do have weird tastes. Personally, I would’ve preferred something more birdlike. You know, with feathers and stuff. This whole half bat half dragon thing is a bit too bony as far as I’m concerned.“I think yours are a lot prettier than mine, Lefi.” I said, casually. “And could you please stop reaching towards them already? Holy shit.”When I first met Lefi, I had been totally overwhelmed by her ridiculous stat page. But, despite that, I still had a very vivid recollection of exactly how she had looked, wings and all. Her form was both dignified and noble. She was a perfect fit for her title and the very embodiment of the the term “legendary dragon.”There was no doubt in my mind that I would have been equally impressed had she shown up in her current form. Even while humanoid, Lefi radiated an aura of mystery, awe, and power. But our first meeting, of course, had already long become a thing of the past. I was no longer able to associate her human form with any sort of majesty whatsoever. To me, she’d long since become nothing more than a selfish roommate.“I-Indeed they are,” stuttered the dragon girl. “A-And I would like to point out that your c-coquetry is misplaced. N-nothing will come of your advances, Yuki.”Lefi stammered, blushed, and fidgeted about. It was clear that she wasn’t used to praise. But coquetry? Really? She sees that as me flirting with her?I frowned. Yeah uh, this is pretty bad. She really needs to stop acting so embarrassed. I know that she’s completely rotten on the inside, but I still can’t help but not know what to say because of how much impact it has when combined with her pretty face. “T-To give an example, your usual form is akin to that of a sugarless donut,” said Lefi. She was still stuttering out of nervousness. “But now, you bear all the charm of a cake covered from top to bottom with delicious frosting. Of course, it is clear as day that my own wings reign supreme, but that means not that yours are lackluster. They are more attractive than what most dragons bear, to say the least.”
“Really? Well uh… Thanks, I guess…” I was a bit confused by her choice of example, but it at least seemed like a compliment. Might as well just nod along with a smile or something.
“You have every right to take pride in your appearance, Yuki. My praise is an honour, one that only a select few have ever experienced.”Lefi faked clearing her throat before continuing in a much more nonchalant, relaxed manner. “But I digress. I recall that you have the Magic Eye skill, correct?”
“Yup.”
“Good. Then watch me. Open your eyes and behold!”
“Roger that ma’am.”Lefi projected a pair of silver wings from her back. They almost looked like the complete opposite of my own. My wings absorbed light. Hers, on the other hand, reflected it.“Is that the same pair you have in your dragon form?”
“It is not. This pair is but a set of false appendages crafted through the use of magic. Its function, however, is near identical.”Gazing at it with my Magic Eye allowed me to confirm that her wings really were constructed of mana as opposed to being something physical that had sprouted from her back. Actually, now that I think about it, it should’ve been pretty obvious from the start seeing as how they’re kinda not the same size. Derp.“Have you nothing to say, Yuki?” Lefi spoke in a tone that seemed to indicate that she was asking for praise.
“Uhm… Err… Uhhhhhh… They’re beautiful. They shine in a way reminiscent of a moon on a cloudless night.”
“How out of character,” said Lefi, with a smirk. “I do believe that it would have been better for you to keep your comments for yourself.”Why you little… You were literally asking for it, god damn it. Seeing the peeved look on my face caused Lefi to break into a smirk. Yeap. She totally did that on purpose. Blech. I got got.“Now let us get on with our business,” she said after a light giggle. “Behold.”A dense wave of magical energy began surging through her body. It looks like she’s… pouring mana into her wings?The dragon flapped the silvery appendages and ascended into the air with a single, fluid motion. So elegant was the action that it rendered me unable to speak. I was completely blown out of the water by her grace and majesty.“Wow…” Only after a brief moment of silence did I finally recover enough to leak a mandatory, shocked gasp. I can’t believe I never realized. I’d always just assumed that my wings had enough mana to function since they were made up of the stuff to begin with. Holy shit.
“If you understand, then there is nothing restricting you any longer, young fledgling. Repeat the steps that I have demonstrated.”
I nodded and followed her instructions. I pumped a concentrated volume of magical energy into my wings and began to beat them with vigour. Prior to Lefi’s instruction, they had only ever moved the slightest bit. But now, they had truly become a part of my body. Manipulating them felt as natural as moving my arms and legs. It was almost like they had always been a part of me.Experiencing the sensation of having functional wings caused me to realize that what I had tried to do earlier in the day was no different from pedalling a bike whose chain was stuck in place, an endeavour bound to fail from the onset.“It is time, Yuki. Take to the skies. Leap into the air with but a single motion!Again, I followed her instructions by flapping my wings with more vigour than ever before. My whole body was assaulted by a sense of weightlessness, and a load of wind pressure to my face.And then, a moment later, I found myself soaring through the sky.“Woooooohoooooo!” I cheered. Or at least I did until I realized that my speed had failed to drop. “Wait! Why can’t I stop!?”The scenery beneath me continued to visibly shrink. The ground was getting further and further away by the moment. I’m going to be honest here. This is fucking terrifying. “Dampen the flow of your mana. You are using too much,” said Lefi. Her voice was coming from right beside me. She had accelerated, caught up, and matched my speed.Following her advice, I reduced the amount of magical energy I had concentrated in my wings. I had practiced controlling my magical energies for quite some time, and I had grown accustomed to it, so it only took me a moment to stabilize myself, albeit with my body bent into a bit of a weird pose.“Woah…”Only after slowing down did I finally get the chance to take in and enjoy the scenery beneath me. The sights I saw were impressive. It felt like I was right next to the sun, like I was in the clouds. My new perspective on the world made the very same scene look completely different. My newfound altitude provided me a much better grasp of nature’s splendor.My whole body began to quiver with emotion. I had always thought that getting a birds eye view of my surroundings would be awesome. And that was exactly what it had turned out to be. In fact, the scene that lay before me was even more beautiful than the one I had imagined.“Amazing, is it not?” asked Lefi. Her face was decorated with a boastful smile. Yeah, I can see exactly where she’s coming from. I mean, who wouldn’t want to brag about a sight like this?We spent a few moments in silence. The dragon girl allowed me to admire the scenery for a bit before speaking up while flashing me a provocative grin. “Now follow me, Yuki. I shall illustrate for you the core concepts of flight and unravel its mysteries. My sole condition is that you must be able to keep up with my speed.”
“Them be fightin’ words,” I replied. “Listen here, Lefi. I can fly. I’ve finally conquered the sky. I’ve become one of this world’s most powerful beings, and there’s no longer anything that can stop me. Not even you!”
“Hah,” Lefi scoffed. “That is absurd. You are still but a fledgling. I shall show you what it means to truly be one of this world’s mightiest.” Lefi hit the gas the moment she finished speaking and flew off without so much as even waiting for a reply.
“Wait, hold up!” Likewise, I once again filled my wings with mana and gave chase.And so, the two of us ventured through the sky and enjoyed ourselves a midair stroll, albeit one that had a bit of speed to it.<– Prev — Next –>

The Unfortunate Adventurers
Editor: Joker, SpeedphoenixThe definition of an adventurer, as I learned it, was a vague one. It denoted the profession as one consisting of individuals that discovered, sought, and confronted the unknown. Adventurers accepted all sorts of requests, fulfilled them, and then returned to their clients for rewards agreed upon at the onset. In some cases, the rewards were plentiful and generous. Many adventurers had, throughout history, amassed immense fame and wealth through their actions. Some even went on to become nobles and were granted pieces of land over which they could lord. Thus, adventuring was a career often sought by those that dreamt big.On its own, the term adventurers actually referred to a large and varied group of people. There were all sorts of different requests for individuals with different skill sets. But even so, adventurers still fell into three main buckets. The first contained those that earned their livings by defeating monsters. The second focused more on gathering resources and materials. The third and final type consisted mostly of scholars involved with the excavation and examination of ancient ruins.Regardless of specialization, there was just one thing that remained true of all adventurers. Every last member of the profession was, at least to some extent, well versed in the art of combat. Our villages, towns, and cities were safe. But that was it. Venturing outside a human settlement was never any different from putting a noose around your neck and stepping atop a stool. Monsters and other non-humans could be found around any corner. And most were hostile.Earning a living in such an environment was something that could only be made possible through a combination of strength and courage. Only the strong could take down their enemies and protect themselves. And only the brave could continue to struggle without yielding, even when while looking death right in the eye. Adventurers that lacked the two aforementioned properties had only two possible fates awaiting them. The first was to die, to be weeded out by tasks and monsters that they were unable to handle. And the second was to stagnate, to be forever stuck at the same rank without any hope of advancement.But that much was common knowledge. It was just what it meant to be an adventurer.Of course, specialization was by no means the only manner in which adventurers were sorted. With it being as important as it was, adventurers were obviously grouped based off of their combat prowess. There were seven different ranks. In ascending order of strength, they were bronze, iron, silver, gold, mithril, adamantite, and orichalcum.We, my two companions and I, were considered mithril. We could only ever possibly ascend another two ranks, so it was safe to say that we were quite strong. Individuals belonging to both the ranks that stood above our own were monstrous in nature. Adamantite tier adventurers were well known as one man armies, whereas orichalcum tier adventurers were pretty much on the tier of strategic armaments. There were as many adventurers out in the world as there were fish in the sea, but even then, there were rarely any more than a few dozen people amongst the top two ranks.Alfyro, the city we were based in, was located in our country’s fringes. There were a lot of monsters in the area, and therefore lots of experienced adventurers. But in spite of that, it wasn’t home to any of our orichalcum class coworkers. Most were under the country’s employ and hidden away except for in times of need. There were a few adamantite adventurers around, but they were currently out of town on a job. And it was precisely for that reason that the Adventurers’ Guild, the organisation responsible for gathering adventurers under their banner, had ended up looking for a party of mithril ranked adventurers to handle a certain task. My party was free at the time. We had just gotten back from another job not too long ago, so we happened to be lazing around the town resting and recuperating. Thus, it was only natural for the aforementioned task, investigating the Wicked Forest, to fall right into our hands.The Wicked Forest was home to the strongest monsters in the area surrounding Alfyro. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the number of monsters the Wicked Forest contained was through the roof. Its population density was ridiculously high despite the environment being far too harsh for human life. It was said that any who entered and attempted to explore the uncharted territory would never return, that thirty minutes was the longest any normal person could ever survive within it. Stepping into the Wicked Forest was no different from entering a dog eat dog world. Might was right within its bounds, and the only laws that applied were those enforced by nature itself.No adventurer ranked gold or lower was allowed to even enter the region, and even orichalcum class adventurers were strictly banned from the forest’s inner sanctum. Anyone that broke any rules related to the Wicked Forest would suffer harsh penalties, regardless of who they were.And it was all because of a single monster: the overwhelmingly powerful creature that lorded over the mountain at the centre of the forest’s deepest depths.Biological superiority was a trait long associated with dragonkind. Dragons had always been and would forever remain the world’s most powerful race. The greatest of them all, the entity that reigned above all other members of its race, was a creature that appeared in historical texts and legends alike, a living calamity. And thus, it was denoted The Supreme Dragon.Calamity class monsters were, in general, capable of ravaging an entire country all on their own. But the Supreme Dragon was different. To it, crushing one measly country was barely an achievement. For it had, in the past, destroyed several at once. Every group sent to subjugate it was completely obliterated. Every attempt on its life was thwarted. And everything that opposed it was met with brutal retaliation. The legendary dragon was so much of a threat that it had forced several countries previously at each other’s throats to form an alliance, one created solely to bring it down. The combined army that was sent to defeat it numbered a whole three hundred thousand strong. Historical records from the era testified that there were even many adamantite and orichalcum adventurers among their ranks. Even so, the army was defeated. Of the three hundred thousand men that left their homes in a quest for glory and justice, no more than a thousand returned. All the others had literally been reduced to ash in a single night.And that was only one of the tales of which the bards would sing. Many, many more had been handed down. They testified that the beast could warp the terrain with but a breath, that the magic it casted matched even the most powerful magus’ trump card, and it would fling them all over with ease. Every single story concerning the dragon sounded more like the tale of a natural disaster than it did a living thing. Fortunately, the creature had little interest in anything but itself. It didn’t care for us humans so long as we left it alone. And so, the allied forces announced a decree. They stated that the Supreme Dragon was to be left to its own devices regardless of the circumstance. A decree still enforced to this very day. There had been over a hundred years since the Supreme Dragon last saw any human interaction, so there was little knowledge regarding its intentions. No one knew if it had changed its mind during the many years it had shut itself in the Wicked Forest’s depths.Or at least that was how it had been.It all started rather recently. The almighty legendary beast that rarely left its nest had been witnessed moving about on more than just a single occasion. Following that came reports of strange occurrences within the Wicked Forest. Territorial disputes had started to occur much more often than ever before, and the many monsters that had been displaced as a result had scattered into the surrounding areas.At first, the guild wrote the occurrence off as a result of the Supreme Dragon’s actions. They thought that the greater frequency with which it moved about had scared the nearby monsters into fleeing further from its domain. But they soon realized that their assumption was off. Supreme Dragon sighting reports failed to always coincide with reports centered around changes in monster activity. It was deemed that the two events weren’t necessarily correlated. The guild instead began to suspect that both the Supreme Dragon’s actions and the monsters’ actions were instead the cause of a third party. Something was making the monsters flee. And that same something was causing change in the Supreme Dragon’s behaviour.Of course, the monsters that left the forest were the less fit, the ones that found themselves unable to maintain their hunting grounds and territories. But even so, they were only weak by the Wicked Forest’s standards. They were still much more powerful than any of the monsters that lived in the areas surrounding it. So much so, in fact, that they immediately ascended to the top of the food chain in any environment they conquered.Fortunately, monsters had the tendency to prefer areas with more magical particles in the atmosphere. These areas were the exact opposite of the areas humans preferred, and thus, very few casualties came as a direct result of the monsters’ movements. Still, the situation was one in which the guild could not simply sit around and twiddle its thumbs. There was a need for an investigation.Risk was the first thing that came to mind when I heard the request’s details. It was a mission that would put the lives of both me and my party members in danger, one that I had honestly wanted to refuse. But I chose not to. The guild’s system was set up in such a way that refusing a direct request from it meant sacrificing one’s reputation. And more importantly, I felt that the issue was one that simply could not be left uninvestigated. It was one that could potentially spiral out of control if left unchecked, and we were the only group that was even potentially up to the task.With that in my mind, my two party members and I soon found ourselves within the Wicked Forest..***“What the fuck!? This is bullshit!” screamed Reyus, the party’s scout.
“Shut up and run, you idiot!” I yelled back. “Save your breath if you don’t want to die!”
“I can’t believe it!” added Lurolle, the party’s mage. “The rumours really were true after all!”Both Reyus and Lurolle were running as hard as they possibly could. I was following right behind them, and right behind me was a horned tiger. We could hear entire trees splinter as easily as would small branches as the beast plowed through one after another to catch its prey, us, as soon as it possibly could.Monsters were, in general, grouped into seven different tiers: non-threats, hazards, menaces, destroyers, disasters, catastrophes, and calamities. Horned tigers fell into the middle tier, the destroyer tier. It was weak enough for a single adamantite adventurer to somehow handle on his own, but mithril class adventurers like us needed a lot more effort to subdue the beast. On average, it took an entire party just to scrape by with a narrow victory.It was strong enough to merit folklore had it taken up residence anywhere outside the Wicked Forest. But with the uncharted region being as ridiculously abnormal as it was, the tiger wasn’t anything special. That said, its presence still did indicate that something was amiss.As mithril ranked adventurers, we had been on expeditions to the Wicked Forest on many an occasion. And never before on any of those journeys did we ever run into such a beast only a few hours in. It was far too close to the forest’s edge, meaning that it had been pushed out of its natural habitat. Further evidence of such a claim could be garnered just by giving the creature a second glance. The feline was thin, abnormally thin. It had very clearly failed to eat for several days, and the way it regarded us made it obvious that it was desperate and impatient. It understood that it would die from starvation if it allowed us to escape its grasp.“How’s your MP looking?” I asked the mage as I maneuvered past a tree.
“Sorry Griffa, it isn’t looking good. I’ve still only got less than a tenth!” she replied.As was mentioned, a party of mithril adventurers would normally come out on top if forced to fight a beast on the level of a horned tiger. The reason that we were running from it regardless was because of the precise issue that I had just mentioned: Lurolle’s MP.Our mage was out of mana.The horned tiger wasn’t the only destroyer tier monster that we had encountered thus far. In fact, we had been fighting monsters equal to it almost nonstop. We were all exhausted, but our mage had it the worst. She was completely out of mana and we had already used up all our options. Knowing that the situation might turn sour, we had brought more supplies than we would have for one of our usual expeditions. But not even that had been enough for us to engage the Wicked Forest’s denizens without rest. My mind was plagued with regret. I knew now that I should have chosen to sacrifice my reputation. The request we were given had turned out far beyond the scope of our abilities.“Grrhhh…”“Woah!” I smashed my foot into the ground and brought my body to a complete stop. The feline at our backs used some sort of skill and suddenly gained a burst of speed, one it used to circle around us and block off our intended route of escape. “Damn it. It looks like we’re going to have to fight.”I drew my sword and grimaced as I resolved myself for death. But at that exact moment, the situation changed. I heard a pair of sounds. The first was a sort of whistling accompanied by a sudden rush of wind. The second, which followed a moment after the first, was also one I easily recognized. A raw, bloody splat.The horned tiger that had cornered us only a moment earlier was lying on the ground, dead. And above it, where it had been only moments prior, towered an even more powerful monster. The aura it exuded was so overwhelming that just seeing it had caused me to completely stiffen up.The creature, the giant wolf, had fur so beautiful I found myself charmed. But accompanying its glamour were four legs, each thick as a log and constructed purely of muscle. It was tall too. The creature stood at about the same height as a single story house, roof and all. Its jaw, which was large enough to swallow any of us whole, contained sharpened fangs massive enough to induce fear.Laying eyes on the creature had caused my heart to begin beating like crazy. I was an experienced adventurer. I had spent much time in the business, honing my senses. And now, every single one of those senses was telling me that I was no match for the creature. My fight or flight instinct activated and urged me to flee. But I couldn’t.I was frozen solid, unable to so much as budge.It felt like death itself would lower its scythe and tear my head from my shoulders the moment I so much as blinked. The little bit of willpower that I managed to scrounge up allowed me to turn my eyes towards the two companions at my side. Like me, they too were frozen stiff. They could do nothing but watch as the overwhelmingly powerful creature standing before them did as it pleased.Fortunately, it cared not for us. Its glance had momentarily fallen upon our forms, but it soon turned its head away in disinterest. It instead grabbed the tiger it had just killed with its mouth and left.All the strength drained from Lurolle’s body; she collapsed onto her butt the moment the creature vanished from her sights. It was malpractice. We were still in the middle of the wicked forest. Monsters could appear from anywhere at any time. But though I wished to scold her, I was none the better. My knees were weak and my palms were sweaty. I was sure that I would begin to tremble the moment I stopped trying not to.“W-We’re alive…” Lurolle muttered under her breath as she stared off into the distance. Her voice was filled with a hint of relief, one that made it seem as if she was still trying to process the situation that had just unfolded.
“Yeah…” agreed Reyus. “That wolf’s gotta at least be disaster class or somethin’.”
“…That’s not even the worst part,” I said.
“Whaddya mean?”
“The wolf. It was collared. It was wearing a choker with engravings around its neck, the same type you’d give to a pet dog.”
“What!?” Reyus’ eyes bulged out of their sockets. “You mean to say that thing’s acting under someone’s orders!?”I knew exactly how he felt. Seeing the collar had led me to suspect that my eyes had gone bad. Disaster tier monsters were incredibly powerful. It would normally take an entire army just to exterminate a single one. Taming them wasn’t supposed to be possible. I knew for a fact that no human was capable of such a feat. And I doubted that demihumans or beastkin had the means to do so either. Hell, not even the demons, mankind’s most detested foes, could pull off anything that ridiculous.“There’s probably something absolutely absurd living in this forest,” I said.I had come to a conclusion. Something was terrifying all of the Wicked Forest’s beasts. That same something had even tamed a disaster tier monster. Even now, it was lurking within the forest’s depths. And there was no guarantee that it wasn’t watching us at this very moment.“We need to get out of here,” I said as a shiver ran down my spine. “As it is now, this place is way beyond us.”
“Agreed,” said Reyus. “We could be immortal and still not have enough lives for this shit.”
“Yeah, let’s just leave. I really don’t want to be here,” said Lurolle.With a unanimous decision made, we retraced our steps at full speed, almost as if to flee the something that lay within the forest’s depths.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, this chapter is following a group of adventurers rather than our demon lord protag. Shift in tone and what happens in the chapter probably gave it away, but just in case, I figured I’d make a mention of it. Let’s see. So the monsters in the forest are trying to get the hell out of dodge to avoid… something. Lefi? Yuki? Or maybe the new big dog on the block, Rir? I’ll take a safe bet and go for all three. All three sounds like a surefire win to me. I’m a guy who likes a surefire win. Like that time I bet on the 1919 White Sox to win it all. *Family Guy style sketch plays* Son of a bitch! Why the hell did they lose this World Series?! They were a surefire win! What, did they cheat or something? Throw the game? I lost thousands on them! *back to the present* Ehehe… maybe not. But I feel confident about this one. Considering how strong they all are, after all. Well, that’s enough from me. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Hunting With Fluffrir
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixIf I had the ability to make only a single comment about flight, then it would be that the sensations experienced during it felt nothing short of amazing. Taking to the sky made me feel as if I had become one with the wind, like I had been liberated from my limits and granted the ability to swim through the great sea of clouds above. And while I knew that it was more likely than not a result of my mind playing tricks on me, I even felt as if the sun had started shining upon me with an even greater degree of radiance, as if it had accepted me and chosen to share with me more of its warmth. It was almost as if its rays had me in a gentle embrace.Both wyverns and massive birds had become a part of the natural scenery around me. And strangely, I related to them. They were just like me, creatures that could soar the skies and experience its glory. I felt an affinity for them. They were my kind, my people.Alas, my sentiments were unreciprocated. All sorts of aerial monsters attacked me regardless of the fact that I had become one of their brethren.“Hmmm….” I frowned as I wiped the blood of a freshly killed wyvern off my face. “I’m getting pretty good at this whole flying thing, but I’m still nowhere near good enough.”Aerial movement no longer felt as foreign to me as it had when I first started out—I was finally used to it. But there was still a long way for me to go. Seeing Lefi fly had imprinted in my mind the reason she prided herself as the Supreme Overlord of the Sky, and why I was still nothing more than another fledgling.Her arrogance was well deserved. I very vividly recalled the way Lefi looked when she first descended upon me in her dragon form. The act of landing had been a display of might, one that was only emphasized by the overwhelming aura radiating off of her body. There was nothing I could do but endure as she subjected me to her majesty. Likewise, her human form was also impossible to ignore, albeit for a different reason. Lefi’s entire flight sequence, as a humanoid, was a thing of beauty. The way the light sparkled as it reflected off her wings and the way in which she gracefully navigated through the sky was so breathtaking that it almost gave me the impression that the sky had been constructed solely to function as a stage to express her magnificence, that the world was a production and she was its star. So otherworldly and stunning was her descent that I could have sworn I was gazing upon an angel.“Oh, there he is!” My thoughts wandered from the dragon girl as I spotted the wolf I had been looking for throughout my airborne expedition. “Hey, Rir!”Shouting in Fluffrir’s direction immediately grabbed his attention. He turned towards me, sat down, and nodded as I landed right beside him. His expression was a calm one. I never would have realized that he was excited had his tail not been wagging back and forth. That’s adorable.“Who’s a good boy? You are! Wait, is it just me, or have you grown a bit? I guess that must mean you’re eating well. Good for you!” A few lines reminiscent of a mother whose son was living away from home left my mouth as I started stroking the puppy’s fur.It was entirely possible for Rir to sustain himself through the absorption of the dungeon’s mana, as with all dungeon monsters. He didn’t need to eat. That, however, didn’t mean that he couldn’t eat. He was able to consume the same things as every other member of his species. If he so wished, he could even remain outside the dungeon’s territory and live purely off the meat of whatever poor creatures he happened to come across.However, staying away from the dungeon and not consuming its mana was bad for him. All dungeon monsters would gradually lose their strength if they avoided the dungeon for too long.Rir’s orders were to kill monsters, with his primary focus being those that were within my territory. Having the dungeon consume corpses was second only to having things die in the dungeon as far as DP income went, but I told Rir that he didn’t have to bother dragging his kills back within the dungeon’s territory, and that he could eat whatever he wanted. It felt like it was a tad bit inefficient as far as min-maxing my DP income went, but I didn’t really mind it all that much. I wasn’t so cruel a master that I would order the poor woofers to live off of just the dungeon’s mana. I knew that such an experience would be nothing short of awful, as like all creatures, the wolf was sure to get sick of eating the same thing day in and day out. Not even someone that really likes curry can eat curry three times a day every day without going mad. Not unless they’ve got some sort of eating disorder. Or their taste buds just don’t work the way they should. But even then, they’d probably get sick of the texture and crave something else.Of course, the reason I told him that it was specifically okay to eat his kills wasn’t because I was too lazy to make him anything better, but rather just because monster meat happened to be tasty as all hell.Curiosity, being the beast it was, had gotten ahold of me and whispered into my ear over and over, and over again until I finally gave into the urge to try it. So, knife in hand, I went through the painstaking process of butchering one of my kills before finally roasting it above an open flame.The result? It was so good that it immediately made me think of super high class marbled beef. It was one of the most delicious, if not the most delicious, things I had ever eaten despite the fact that I likely botched up the blood draining process on account of knowing jack shit.Lefi later informed me that monster flesh being more delicious than the flesh of non-monsters was a part of this world’s common sense. Monsters were creatures whose bodies contained magical energy, and that same magical energy would continue to saturate their flesh even after death, enhancing its flavour.Learning that bit of knowledge had led to a change in the state of my inventory. I started shoving countless corpses into the magical item box, one after another, in hopes of being able to consume them at my leisure. I had so many, in fact, pulling them all out would have created a stack large enough to be called a mountain. It was still inferior to the stack Lefi had made just the other day, however. Man, am I glad time doesn’t tick inside my inventory. I can store as much shit as I want without ever having to worry about it going bad.“I’m not really all that familiar with the area we’re headed to, so you’re probably going to have to show me around. That okay, boy?”Rir woofed to affirm before turning his side to me and crouching.“What, you want me to ride you or something?”While I couldn’t speak wolf, the happy bark I got as a response told me all I needed to know. “Alright boy, I’ll be glad to take up that offer of yours.”Following Rir’s prompts, I got onto his back and straddled it to secure myself. He only got up once he was sure I was firmly on his back.“Mmkay. I’m ready. LegggooooooOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!? HOOOOOLY SHIT!”I was assaulted by an incredible amount of wind pressure as Rir burst into a sprint. He was so quick that I had to grab ahold of his fur and squeeze down even harder with my legs if I didn’t want to risk falling off.“This is fucking awesome! You’re the man, Rir!” I cheered and enjoyed the ride as Rir carried me deeper into the forest.Today was supposed to be a bit of a recreation day for Rir and I. I felt as if I hadn’t hung out with the wolf nearly as much as I should have, so I decided to spend the better part of the day playing with him.Of course, playing didn’t necessitate hunting. Or at least it wouldn’t have had I not wasted most of my DP on Flight. My figurative wallet, which had been fat as a whale, was now as thin as a tightrope and I wanted to see it refilled. Hunting just so happened to be an activity that satisfied both the “hang out with Rir” and the “make bank” goals I had in mind. Its dual purpose led it to be my top choice.The forest consisted of four major areas, which could each be conveniently attributed a cardinal direction based on its location relative to the cave that the throne room was in. North of the cave was what used to be Lefi’s domain. It was more or less devoid of monsters. Their fear of her had caused basically everything notable to vacate the area.Opposite her former home lay the area in which I focused my dungeon’s expansions. Unlike the northern region, the southern one contained many monsters. That said, they were extremely weak, and even I found myself exterminating them en masse with ease, despite knowing little to nothing about martial arts.The eastern region was the most average of the bunch. The monsters that showed up there weren’t particularly weak, but they weren’t particularly strong either. A few tougher ones did show up every now and again, but it wasn’t anything too far off the deep end. The eastern region was the best match for me given my current skills. If I were to train with the intention of growing stronger, then the eastern region would be the best possible choice.Finally, there was the west. Unlike the other three regions, the western region was rather dangerous. Most of the monsters were too powerful for me to handle in my current state. It was so strikingly obvious that I could tell with just a glance. Even its weaker monsters were a good bit stronger than the ones in the eastern region. I only ever ventured west with Lefi in tow. It wasn’t safe otherwise.Though with that said, the regions were only loosely defined. Their definitions weren’t strict by any means, and both the east and west contained monsters that could totally obliterate me without a second thought. Fortunately, I had to go fairly far in either direction in order to run into anything that powerful.Lefi had warned me not to venture too far since I was still weak, and I did take her warning to heart, but it had also inspired in me a spark of curiosity. Half of me was extremely curious and wanted to go check it out, but the other half bitched and screamed about how awful and terrifying an idea it was.Most of my DP had naturally come from monsters that lay to the dungeon’s south. Keyword: had. It seemed that Rir and I had accidentally hunted a few too many monsters and kinda sorta maybe damaged the whole region’s ecosystem. Just a bit.As a result, all the monsters that lived in the area immediately south of the dungeon had migrated further south in an attempt to escape our hunting grounds. They, in turn, displaced the monsters that used to live within their new territory, and so on, and so forth. In other words, many of the monsters that lived in my domain ended up moving outside of it, thereby reducing the amount of DP I passively gained on a daily basis.Venturing further south myself was of course an option, but I decided against it. I felt as if it made more sense to pull out of the south and hunt elsewhere until the southern ecosystem fixed itself, hence why Rir and I were headed east instead. I might as well use this as an opportunity to start expanding the dungeon eastwards while we’re at it.***“Horned tiger spotted.” A little bit of exploring and a few corpses later, Rir and I chanced upon a creature that basically looked like a tiger with a unicorn’s horn protruding from its forehead. The oversized cat promptly started to growl as it caught wind of Rir’s presence.My wolf, however, was the only thing it had detected. The soon to be dead kitty had yet to spot me, in part because I was no longer on the Fenrir’s back.Horned tigers appeared ferocious and deadly, but they were far from it. They were slow and their attacks contained next to no power. I wasn’t even the slightest bit afraid of them. In fact, I saw them as less of a threat than the massive bunnies that roamed the forest. Giftig rabbits and horned tigers were quite similar in the respect that they were roughly the same size and equally durable. However, unlike horned tigers, giftig rabbits were actually threatening. They were extremely quick on their feet. Their core strategy consisted of darting about until their foe lost sight of them before closing in and delivering a fatal blow with fangs coated in a deadly poison. Calling that shit deadly might even be an understatement.I had once witnessed a giftig rabbit bite something ten times its size. Frankly, it was quite the terrifying sight to behold. The limb it bit had changed colours in less than ten seconds, and the whole creature had died in less than thirty. Yeah, at this point, I’d say I’m pretty confident in my assumption that specialized fighters are much more difficult to deal with than generalists. Anyway, enough about rabbits for now. Focus, Yuki. Focus. This next bombing run won’t be any fun if you let yourself get distracted.Discarding my rabbit-related thoughts, I lifted my sword and dove. I let gravity take control as I plummeted straight towards the horned tiger in my sights. The moment I passed the orange ass son of a bitch by, I swung my blade and smashed its skull. R. I. P. Kitty cat.There was a violent bloodsplosion of brain and flesh as the tiger, which remained unaware of me to the very end, fell over and died. Again, I had successfully executed the strategy that Rir and I had devised just a bit earlier. Not that it actually deserves to be called a strategy, but whatever.All the “strategy” consisted of was having Rir bait out a target while I used Stealth to rise into the air and then suddenly descend and blow its head to bits. The wolf would ensure that everything went well by using Everchanging Chains to bind the target in place in the case that it noticed me prior to the completion of my descent.Though I was now happily going along with gravity’s whims, diving headfirst into the ground was in fact not a part of the original plan. I was supposed to be slowly gliding down and sneaking up on my foes instead of showing them how it felt to be involved in a car accident, but experiencing Rir’s racecar-like speed had made me thirst for it. My mind, thrown off by adrenaline, had somehow managed to come up with the brilliant idea of diving into the ground and not slowing down until the moment before I landed.While I was by no means as skilled a flier as Lefi, I felt as if I would still be able to pull it off, which somehow led to the conclusion that I should man up and give it a try. And so, I ended up descending as would a payload from a high flying bomber.Naturally, my attempt at slowing down and landing totally failed. In fact, I wasn’t even able to alter my speed before I hit the ground. Rir panicked a bit upon the “technique’s” inception. The mix of shock and worry on his face at the time was quite the sight to behold. To be honest, I almost shat myself back then too. Totes thought I was gonna die. Fortunately, my body was that of a demon lord’s. It was so resilient that the fall didn’t so much as drain a single point of my hp. I got off completely scot-free. And the moment I came to that realization was also the moment I completely chucked the concept of hitting the brakes out the window. I let gravity take control and became a single bullet, a tool constructed purely to inflict damage and cause destruction.The “technique” was an embodiment of brute force, one made possible through my body’s specs and my body’s specs alone. That, however, wasn’t why I continued to reproduce it. I didn’t really care for showing off.All I wanted to do was have fun.I had always been the type to love amusement parks, specifically the rides designed to make you scream. Actually, now that I think about it, I could totally turn this into an attraction and spin a fuckton of profit. I’d probably need to find it something to give it critical acclaim for that, though. I wonder what that ad would sound like? “Spread your wings: a fun, family friendly free fall! Try it now and get your review featured in our limited edition pamphlet!” Heh.“Oh god damn it… Not another one.” As I was patting the blood, dust, and gore off me with one hand, I looked at the other and realized that my sword was missing its blade. The sharpened part of the weapon had snapped right off its grip. Yeah, this is a problem. I really need to do something about my whole weapon situation.I contemplated my options while adding the area I was in to the dungeon’s territory. I’ve still got that gun, but it takes a while to reload. I mean, it works for a good trump card, but I still need some sort of main weapon.As much as I wanted to use them, swords were no good. They just didn’t cut it. I’m not sure if it’s me or them, but for some odd reason, swords and I just can’t work well together. They don’t really feel all that natural and I’ve already destroyed quite a few more than I’m willing to admit.While I couldn’t deny that my lack of knowledge and skill had played into it, I felt as if swords were far too fragile for me. I couldn’t draw out all my power unless I made use of a sturdier weapon. They also weren’t as easy to handle as I had expected. But I dunno what else I’m supposed to be using… Actually, you know what? Fuck it. I purchased a literal bar of iron from the catalogue and holstered it over my shoulder. I mean. It’s at least kinda weapon shaped, so it should work. Besides, it’s not like I was actually using the sword to cut stuff anyway, so why not, right? A metal rod is more of a blunt weapon than a sword is, so it might even be more effective, the way I’m using it. And so, Rir and I went around looking for more prey. The poor wolf’s expression distorted each time I ended a creature’s life. It was clear that he was starting to pity our foes, or at least their butchered remains.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another prequel chapter of Jingai Musume down, and we’re one step closer to catching up and correcting the multitude of errors in the previous translation. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that he was translating it, but I personally prefer quality over quantity. Hence why I moved here. Looks like our Demon Lord is slowly learning his strengths and limitations in terms of weapons and fighting. Gotta say, sneaking up to a monster and crushing its head with a bar of iron just makes me a bit queasy. Speaking of queasy, obviously Yuki hasn’t met Fran, otherwise he’d retract his statement about curry right quick. Man, can you imagine Yuki and Fran teaming up with Sword-dad and Lefi? They could have two worlds under their control. All Yuki would have to do is buy tons of curry from the catalogue and he’d be golden. All right, I gotta split. My sister’s boyfriend, the one who’s trying to kill me by getting me Raisin’ Cane’s constantly, graduated today, so we’re having a party at the house. I hope there’s still pizza left. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Insects Sure Do Cause Goosebumps, Don’t They?
Editor(s): Joker“Oh shit!” I shouted out of reflex as I swerved my face to the side to dodge a wad of acid. “Hooooly crap, that almost got me!”The yellowish green liquid flew right past my face and hit a nearby tree. The unfortunate plant was killed by the attack in an instant. Half its trunk was immediately turned to goop. The other half was unable to support its own weight, so it snapped and collapsed. Oh god. That could’ve been my face. Rir and I were in the midst of a desperate escape. Behind us followed a veritable army group of ants. Massive, gigantic, oversized ants. Every single specimen was at least the size of the average dog.And when I said an army, I meant an army. There were so many of the carapace-clad, six legged freaks that the thought of counting them didn’t even cross my mind. It was a fool’s errand, one that I really didn’t want to bother wasting my time with. The wave of insectoid bodies almost seemed to swallow the scene behind us as they gave chase. Some were on the ground, others were in the air, but either way, they almost seemed to pollute the environment with their sheer numbers. It was a disgusting sight to behold. There were so many creepy crawlies that I started to get goosebumps.It hadn’t started this way. At first, there had only been a few. They were rather weak, so I thought them easy prey. But a second, slightly larger group showed up almost right as we defeated the first. And then a third, and so on and so forth. I hadn’t thought much of it at the time.My naivety had gotten the better of me.Every time I killed one, several others came to take its place. That, in and of itself, wasn’t a problem. I expected to be able to slaughter them all eventually. But the eventuality I expected never happened. Their numbers never diminished no matter how long we fought. Before long, Rir and I found ourselves overwhelmed with a force far outside our expectations, so we fled.Only to encounter another problem.Rir was fast. He was more of a sprinter than he was an endurance runner, but he was still a fenrir. His speed was undoubtable. If he were to race against most other monsters, he would likely reach the goal before they even left the start zone. But, despite his outstanding speed, Rir was unable to escape the ants.They were still right on his tail.“Hey uh, you sure I shouldn’t get off!?” I was well aware that I was slowing the large wolf down, but he responded with a growl as if to tell me that my concern was unnecessary. He and I both knew that he was faster than me. And since the ants had fliers among them, I was sure to be swarmed, torn to bits, and devoured if I didn’t remain on the wolf’s back. The thought made me shudder. Oh god. Why the hell did I have to go and imagine that? Ugh…“A-Alright.” I shook my head a bit to ward off the scene created by my imagination before spinning around while still on Rir’s back. Evidently, the young fenrir was prepared to carry me for as long as he was capable even if it meant his death. As his master, I’m not about to just idly sit by and let him be the only one to act like a man. “Then I guess I might as well give it everything I got.”I was now facing the incoming army, but that, in and of itself, didn’t actually free up too many options. My gun was out of ammo, and the iron rod I had in my hand was well… an ordinary iron rod. Unlike Sun Wukong’s Ruyi Jingu Bang, it couldn’t suddenly extend and allow me to strike the enemy’s army in just a single fell swoop. Though I wish it did. That’d make this easy.Let’s see… Yeah, uh, looks like I’m pretty much all out of options. Welp. Magic time, I guess. I had yet to use magic in a real battle, but I was fairly confident that there wouldn’t be any undesired surprises. Granny’s always told me that everything would work out as long as I believe in myself. Not that I’ve got a granny. Topkek.After making my decision, I immediately kneaded my mana and cast the spell that I had spent the better part of the last few days practicing. Three massive oriental dragons materialized around me. Their long serpentine forms were constructed of water. Specifically hot water around the same temperature you’d have it at when filling a bathtub, but that part’s not important.Their clear, distinct forms served to evidence that my imagination was becoming more vivid. Wait, doesn’t that just mean that I’m getting more delusional? Fuck. Feelsbadman.“Take this, you assholes!” I shrugged off my laments and had all three dragons assault the incoming army. They shot through the air like bolts of lightning and swallowed many an ant whole.Although it didn’t look it, the deadly spell I casted was rather simple in nature. The dragons would swallow their targets and then coil up. The high speed currents running inside of them would swirl about to prevent the targets from escaping while also functioning like pressure cutters. I even mixed a bit of sand into the water to give it extra grit, and therefore power. Those that the pressure based blades failed to slice to bits would be held within the powerful currents until they drowned.If I had to be completely honest, there was no logic behind the spell’s shape. It simply looked the way it did because I liked the aesthetic. You know what? I need to show this spell to Lefi. She told me to do exactly that if I came up with anything so she could judge it, and I’m pretty sure she’ll give me full points given the way it looks. I mean, it’s both artsy and badass as fuck. What could possibly go wrong?The dragons did their job and shredded a large number of ants as I sat on Rir’s back, lost in thought. Seeing that, I crossed my arms and began to haughtily laugh.“Mwahahahaha! Take that, insects! Fall! Fall b-before…” My eyes went wide as the ants that hadn’t been caught in the spell began a counterattack by blasting corrosive acid in my direction. “Fuck! Oh god, I’m sorry! I’M SORRY!!”Unable to contain myself, I began to scream and apologize vehemently, but to no avail. The discoloured, formic-acid like attacks kept coming right at us.“You know what? Fuck you! You assholes are just ants! Ants! You ain’t got shit!”I continued creating water dragons and firing them at the incoming swarm. Although my position seemed favourable, it wasn’t by any means. My spells were working exactly as intended, but I was most likely going to run out of mana before I managed to eliminate them all. There were just too many of them.Magic was supposed to be more versatile and adaptable, but I had failed to practice anything but the one spell that I had been using nonstop. I didn’t have the means or experience to cope with the situation. Shit. I would’ve spent more time expanding my repertoire if I knew this was going to happen. God damn it, what do I do? Do I have anything to slow them down? Wait! Yes, I do!I reached into my inventory and grabbed a monster corpse, which I promptly chucked right at the mob. I repeated the action several times even though I felt it a waste of good food. At first, the ants avoided the projectiles, but stopped upon identifying them. They instead started to swarm the previous meat and gorge themselves with it. Uhhh… That was a bit more effective than I was expecting it to be. Really didn’t think they’d stop entirely. “T-totally calculated,” I stuttered. “Let’s go, Rir. We need to get ourselves the fuck outta here.”Having seen through my bluff, the large white wolf put on the canine equivalent to a wry smile before evacuating the area.“Whew…” Only after losing sight of the ants did I finally breathe a sigh of relief. “Holy shit, that was exhausting. Why don’t we call it a day.”
“Woof.”
“Yeah, you too. You did real good out there, boy.”
“Ruff?”
“You know what, yeah? I would appreciate if you brought me all the way back to the cave. You know what? You might as well stay the night while you’re at it.” I paused for a moment to stretch the stiffness out of my shoulders. “Man, those ants. I swear, there were enough of the goddamned things to traumatize a guy for life.”
“Woof?”
“Good point. There probably was an anthill nearby.”I put a hand to my chin as I recalled the anthills that I’d seen on TV back in Japan. They were easily the same height as the average person even though the ants that inhabited them were tiny. Which means those giant ass ants we were dealing with just now probably live in a literal mountain or something. Actually, thinking along those lines, finding it and making the area a part of the dungeon would probably net me mad bank. But uhhhhh… yeah no. I don’t think I’ll ever be going there again.While I didn’t particularly hate bugs, the sheer number of them had left my skin riddled with goosebumps. I was so terrified of the giant ass ants in particular that I almost wanted to start ranting on and on about how the world would be a much better place if all insects suddenly ceased to exist. Man, thinking back on it, you know who gets chased by giant fucking bugs all the time? Indi*na Jones. After experiencing it myself, man, I respect the hell outta the guy. He’s gotta have balls of steel to stay sane after all that shit.“I’m really going to have to work on expanding my arsenal though…” I continued to think as Rir gently carried me home. I need more weaponry. I’ve been managing with basically just my stats so far, but as all those annoying ass bugs have proven, I’m still a few steps away from having all my bases covered. Really going to need something to deal with massive swarms of enemies if I don’t want to die. Magic is nice and all, so I’ll be working on that, but I should probably look into other stuff too. Yeah, you know what? I’ll make sure I sink a good bit of time into finding something I can work with in the short term.***I ended up showing Lefi the water dragon spell I had developed a few days later.“…Yuki, I’ve a question.”
“Ask away.”
“Is there a particular reason for which you have forged the spell in a dragon’s image?”
“Nah, not really.”
“Your preferences are… “ Lefi took a moment to find the right word to describe how she was feeling. “Quite bizarre.”Yeah… Can’t really say she’s wrong there.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Boy, Yuki really stirred up the ant’s nest this time around, didn’t he? He should’ve known better. Anthills contain literal THOUSANDS, after all. Plus, they can spit acid, so there’s that as well. Luckily, he managed to break through by sacrificing his lunch and launching his multiple water dragons. Rir did good as well. He’s not an endurance runner, as it said, so he’s probably real tired. Good boy, Rir. You get first dibs on the good meat today. And of course, Lefi’s not impressed by Yuki’s taste. Maybe if it was a majestic European dragon, with a bigger body and longer neck, she might be. Or just say that you did it because of how cool she looks. Appeal to her vanity, after all. See y’all in the next chapter!Translator’s note: Yuki used 2ch slang this chapter. So voila, 4chan slang to match. I didn’t add references tags this time because I was lazy because I think most of them are obvious, but just to be safe, there was a Mai Otome reference, an Indiana Jones reference, and a Journey to the West reference. Probably not in that order.<– Prev — Next –>

The Demon Lord of Creativity
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerHunting with Rir had led me to a pretty significant realization. While I was a Demon Lord, and had all the strength to back my title, I didn’t have any sort of tool that let me demonstrate said strength to its fullest extent; I still lacked a weapon. I’ve been using a sword so far, mostly just ‘cause that’s what people who get taken to other worlds tend to do in novels and stuff, but they don’t actually work for me. Hmm… I guess I’ll just look through the catalogue and see if I can find anything decent.I sat atop the throne with my legs crossed and my chin propped up by my left arm, as I usually did while racking my brain. Most of the items listed in it were swords. Probably because they’re so orthodox. I’d only ever bought cheap blades for myself thus far. It was possible that I wouldn’t have so much trouble with them if I bought something a bit more expensive, but there was no guarantee that even a higher quality product would suit my needs. Naturally, purchasing and trying each and every single one was out of the question. That would basically just be a huge waste of resources.Spears, bows, katanas, and many other weapons were in the catalogue, but none quite seemed to fit my needs for the exact same reason I couldn’t use a sword. They didn’t appear durable enough to withstand the full brunt of my power. Traditional weapons aside, there were even full blown embodiments of badassery, like steel threads for example, but I knew for a fact that I wouldn’t be able to use them either. I’ve got some pretty good dex, which implies I should be hella good with my hands, but apparently dex doesn’t actually apply to weapon usage… My good friend the iron bar had actually worked out surprisingly well. It was easy to use. There wasn’t really any finesse or technique involved in handling the effective stick; all I had to do to hurt something with it was to give my target a good old smack. I guess I should probably get a blunt weapon then. Something that relies mostly on brute force. Oh, I guess I could do a club. That actually sounds pretty good. …Wait a second. What kind of demon lord uses a club? That’s lame as hell. Let’s not. I shifted my posture a bit as I approached the problem from a different direction. I want to use something more… iconic. I need a weapon that makes me feel more like a final boss in a JRPG. Whatever I use needs to be badass as fuck. Wait. What do final bosses use anyways? Swords? Nah, not really. Hell, most of them aren’t even human shaped. Wait! That’s it! I could just find myself a skill that lets me transform into some giant ass monster! Yeah! That could be fun. I’ve always wanted to roar at people. Wait wait wait. God damn it, Yuki. Stop that. Get ahold of yourself. You need to take this more seriously.After a bit more brooding, I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t going to be able to use anything that relied heavily on technical skill. I needed a weapon that delivered fatal blows. Its strikes needed to be heavy enough to smash my targets to bits. In M*nster Hunter terms, I’d probably want something more like a greatsword or hammer than twinblades or anything one handed. Wait. That’s an idea. I could just use a greatsword! I began browsing the catalogue with vigour immediately after coming to the conclusion. Greatswords were technically still swords, so my Sword Art skill wouldn’t go to waste. They were also heavier than iron bars and therefore could put out a larger amount of force.Most important, however, was the fact that they were badass as fuck. Training is a huge pain. Cool weapons can really help me walk the extra mile since they make it easier for me to motivate myself to keep trying. Yup. Totally legit reason. I definitely don’t just want a cool weapon because I’m immature. Nope. Not at all.There were several listed in the catalogue with some being much more expensive than the others. Unfortunately, I had just splurged on Flight. I didn’t have all that much DP on hand, so I picked the most expensive one I could afford.I grabbed the weapon by the handle and started examining it in more detail the moment it materialized.“So you finally discarded those toys of yours and sought a more potent weapon?” asked Lefi. Her tone was triumphant, but not because of anything I had done. The dragon had just beat our resident vampire at Othello, and was in high spirits as a result. She’s probably only that happy ‘cause she’s never managed to beat me. Heh.
“Don’t you worry. One day, my swordplay will be good enough to take a scale or two off of you, even in your dragon form.”
“A bold claim.” A fearless grin appeared on Lefi’s face. “I pride my scales in their durability, for they are harder than even divine steel. I do look forward to the day you become capable of damaging them.”The fact that she seemed to think my claim a total bluff had me a bit miffed, but I shook it off and went back to looking at the two handed blade. This thing sure is light…I didn’t need to swing the blade to know that it lacked the weight I desired. It was obviously significantly heavier than the literal iron bar I had resorted to using, but it still wasn’t enough. I need something that actually feels heavy in my hands. Something with so much weight that it can smash right through a boulder.Despite never having been able to even so much as do a handstand in my past life, I was now able to swing my own body weight around with ease. How do I put this… the blade’s too thin. I was expecting something as fat as the stuff you find in Monster H*nter, something with a blade as thick and wide as my waist. This thing is more like a claymore or zweihander than a Monst*r Hunter style greatsword. It’d probably snap right in half if I smashed it against a boulder. Though, that’s kinda fair since it probably wasn’t made with smashing boulders in mind.…Wait! That’s it! I get it now. This thing wasn’t made with demon lords in mind. It was made for a human. Greatswords were large, heavy weapons. And as a result, they were hard, very hard to use. Hence, with human ingenuity being what it was, blacksmiths and other artisans had worked to develop them to be as light as possible such that they could be even the slightest bit less unwieldy.In other words, the blade I was holding in my hand had been refined such that it was exactly the opposite of what I was looking for.There were several higher quality weapons sitting around in the shop, but even the cheapest amongst them were two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than the blade I had in hand. I couldn’t afford them, and naturally, looking for something cheaper wasn’t going to help either. Actually, wait. I could’ve sworn that I saw just the right skill for this type of situation just the other day.I scrolled through the catalogue and eventually found the skill I was looking for. Its name was Weapon Transmutation. And according to its description, it was capable of turning materials into weapons. All I needed to do was run my mana through the materials while envisioning the form I wanted the final product to have. The quality of weapon it created was based on the clarity of my mental image of it, the amount of mana I put into it, and the quality of the raw materials used.Apparently, leveling the skill allowed it to produce higher quality weapons without the need for as many materials or an excessive amount of magical energy. Heh. If there ain’t any weapons that fit me, then I’ll just make one myself. All I need to do is become the sole Demon Lord capable of anything and everything, The Demon Lord of Creativity.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, Yuki’s got himself a handle on what kind of Demon Lord he wants to be. That’s good. It’s always good to have a clear idea of what you want to be. There you go. That’s the inaugural post of Joker’s Life Lessons (trademark pending). Have a good idea of what you want to be in the future so you can work towards it. Huh? What do I want to be? That’s easy. I want to be *Transmission interrupted* have six pumpkins in an herbal jacuzzi. Phew, that took a while to get out. My throat’s dry and my voice is almost gone. But I hope that gives you some idea of the kind of life I have planned. ^^ All right, all. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Demon Lord of Creativity — Part 2
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixAll I need to do is become the sole Demon Lord capable of anything and everything, The Demon Lord of creativity. Aw hell yeah, that sounds badass as fuck. I’ll open up a brand new path for all Demon Lords to come. I shall show them that it would only be right for them to follow in my footsteps!The most important tool in fulfilling my newfound ambition would be none other than Weapon Transmutation. Fortunately, I had everything I needed to make good use of the ability. Iron wasn’t all that difficult for me to obtain. All I needed to do to get my hands on it was literally buy it off the catalogue. Likewise, I was also able to easily fulfill the other requirement, the ability to form concrete images within my mind. Practicing magic had led me to become much more skilled in the art of delusion. Even Lefi’s given me the thumbs up and told me that my ability to cast spells is at least above average. I’m confident I’ll be able to churn out something decent.Truth be told, weapon transmutation was not the only skill that had caught my eye. Enchant had done the same. The skill’s effects did exactly the same thing it described. It allowed me to imbue a weapon with magic-based techniques. Magic-based techniques were similar to magic, but of a different vein. Their effects were driven by logic as opposed to the power of one’s imagination. As a result, scholars and other academics cared more for magic-based techniques than they did magic itself. According to Lefi, anyway.To be more specific, Enchant was capable of enhancing items with magical effects by engraving them with magic circuits. I was capable of engraving both the circuits provided by the spell as well as any that I happened to know. The former of the two categories would be expanded upon each time the skill gained a level. At level one, it only came with a pair of seemingly worthless skills: Lesser Spell Range Boost and Lesser MP Cost Reduction. Yeahhh, I should probably take some time to learn myself a few magic circuits.The number of circuits an item could hold and the effectiveness of each was dependant on three factors: the size of the item, the shape of the item, and most importantly, the quality of the item. Of course, quality denoted the literal quality. Better made items were far more suited for enchantment than poorly made ones. However, the individual qualities associated with the base materials also played a role. For example, an item made of mithril would be far more suitable for magical enhancements than an otherwise identical one made of iron. Unlike Iron, Mithril was a substance that naturally overflowed with magical energy. Thus, it would result in greater compatibility with magical enhancements. Any magical enhancements engraved into it would also be more powerful than those engraved into the identical iron weapon.Huh. Those two level one enchantments don’t really amount to much, but they honestly don’t look all that shabby. That little bit of extra oomph they give might make a difference in a fight. And I was kind of planning to learn more magic anyway. Might as well, right?Contemplating the two circuits the skill came with sparked a thought: I wanted to enhance my weapons. I wanted to enchant each to have more devastating effects than the last. I wanted to ultimately end up with some sort of endgame weapon with all sorts of different special effects plastered onto it. Just like in RPGs. That thought in mind, I immediately hit the purchase button and learned both Enchant and Weapon Transmutation, after which I immediately glanced at my stat page.***General Information Name: Yuki

Supreme Dragon’s OwnerDP: 32041***Woo! Looks like I succeeded in learning both.My level had gone up quite a bit since I last looked. And all my stats, luck included, had risen accordingly. Oh thank god. I’m so glad my luck actually does rise every once in a while. Man, I was worried it was going to be stuck at 70 forever.The reason I only had three skill points remaining was because I had thrown everything I had into Analyze. I’d long since decided to invest in the skill until it was max, given how useful it was. My ultimate goal was to have it show me Lefi’s stats. It’s already level eight, but I still can’t see shit. God damn. Why d-WAIT A SECOND! What’s with that weird ass title!?I slid my finger over the title in question and gave it a quick tap in order to check over its details.***Supreme Dragon’s Owner: A title granted to the individual fearless enough to tame the dragon that reigns supreme over all else.***I blinked a few times as I stared the description down. So uh… The hell did I do to deserve this? Hmm… I mean I guess I did basically feed her until she got used to me, which is what people do to tame wild animals. So I mean, it isn’t really wrong, but… She’d totally kill me if she found out I was basically treating her like a pet. I could totally see her throwing a fit and stamping her feet in anger. Speaking of titles, Lefi had totally seen the title indicating that I had come from another world, but she didn’t pay it much heed. I even tried pointing it out to her by telling her that I hadn’t started off as one of this world’s denizens, but again, she hadn’t really reacted. She had basically just brushed me off with a disinterested grunt. It didn’t really seem like she cared.While it wasn’t possible for me to declare that I didn’t have any regrets about leaving Japan behind me, I really didn’t care all that much either. My death back there was a fact. It, like everything else that had ever happened to me, was already all in the past. Living life as a Demon Lord was fun, after all, and enjoying the moment was what mattered. I had long ago decided that whatever world I was in would be the world I belonged to. And that was that. That resolution alone would never change. And that’s why… it’s okay for me to put my past, my old life, behind me. Anyway, moving on. It’s time to use me some skills! Woo!First thing’s first, I decided to go for a trial run in order to get a better feel for the way the skill worked. I used a bit of DP and bought myself a fist sized iron ingot. Kinda a bit late to be asking since I’ve already gone ahead and bought the damn thing, but what the hell’s this doing in the catalogue anyway? Damned thing has got more variety than a variety store.“I see that you are doing something strange again, Yuki,” said Lefi, as she wandered over.“Are you going to show us a new magic trick?” added Illuna. The younger of the two girls had just lost to Lefi in Othello, so she had puffed up her cheeks at the dragon in a childish expression of indignance, but that had all changed the moment she noticed that I was about to do something. She, like her Othello partner, had curiously started walking towards me.“Uhhh… kinda, but not really,” I said. “And Lefi, how about you don’t try to make it sound like I do weird shit all the time?”Like, come on! All I ever do is test whether or not certain things are actually possible.“Anyway, you guys are free to look all you want, but honestly, it probably ain’t gonna be that fun to watch.”Seeing the two monster girls’ expressions brought a wry smile to my face. The vampire girl’s eyes were brimming with curiosity. She couldn’t wait to see what I had in store. Likewise, the dragon girl was equally invested in my actions. She tried to feign disinterest by calling me weird, but she was definitely every bit as curious as Illuna.My first product was going to be a dagger. The image I had in my head was that of an army knife. Specifically, the type that typically had everything from handle to blade made entirely of stainless steel. Its form was easy for me to imagine. All I had to do was recall the days I used to play first person shooters. The knife I had in mind was exactly the one I always used for close quarters combat.Magical energy flowed into the ingot as I sharpened my image of the weapon. Only after said energy evened out did I finally activate the skill. The raw material began to morph. It moved in an eerie, disturbing fashion, almost like a creature with a mind of its own, as it took on the form of the dagger I had in mind. Eugh… that’s gross.“Hmmm… Not bad.” I nodded as I looked over the completed product. It looked exactly as I had imagined it. The blade, which was nice, thick, and meaty, sat at the comfortable length of twelve centimetres. Every bit of it was made purely of iron. The only problem I had with it was that the grip was a bit edgy. I should probably wrap some sort of rope or something around it later.Opening the item box, I pulled out a random piece of monster meat and sliced at it in order to test the knife’s edge. The motion was smooth; the knife slid right through my test target without any noteworthy resistance. Wow, this blade seems pretty tough. I didn’t cast or forge it, so I was thinking it might be kinda brittle. But guess not. How’s that work? I suspected that the answer to my question was that the magical energy somehow operated alongside the molecules within the iron in order to manipulate it, but of course, that was just a random conjecture. Anyway, enough of that. Let’s analyze this thing and check it out.***Demon Lord’s Dagger: A dagger crafted by a Demon Lord by the name of Yuki. It doesn’t have a name. Quality: B-***Analyze shows quality now? That’s neat. Pouring so many points into it has really paid off. For some reason that not even I was able to explain, I somehow knew that an item with a quality rating of B- was fairly decent, and that it was worth roughly a thousand yen more than the average knife. Though, I guess that doesn’t really make much sense, does it? Yeah, iunno. Not even I can make much sense out of what that means, and I’m the one that’s somehow sensing it.My first attempt at creating a weapon had proven successful. According to Weapon Transmutation, it had to do with my dexterity stat. The higher the caster’s dexterity, the higher the quality of the good produced. Heh, nice to see that overinflated dex stat I’ve got is finally proving itself useful. I swear the damned thing’s just been sitting there doing nothing up until now.A confident smirk showed itself on my face as I turned towards the (imaginary) demon lords learning from my example. Now listen up, maggots! If you girls want to become real men, real Demon Lords of Creativity, then you’ve gotta invest heavily in dex! That’s a firm rule, boys! No questions or rebuttals.“How interesting,” said Lefi, as she focused her gaze on the newly crafted knife. “I see that you have casted one of the blacksmithing magics used by the mountain people to create a weapon. I admit, it does appear rather well made.”
“Wow Yuki!” added Illuna. “You can do anything! You can make all sorts of cool stuff, and you can even cook! You’re so cool! You’re just like a mom!”Uhh… I mean, I know that’s a compliment, but I’m really not sure how I’m supposed to feel right about now.“Heh, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. That was just a test run. This time, I’ll go all out and make something even better.”I opened the catalogue again and bought a second iron ingot, one that weighed about ten kilograms. I wanted to work with mithril instead, but I couldn’t afford it. ‘Kay. I’ve got the gist of this whole Weapon Transmutation thing. Time to make myself a real weapon.The plan was for my second weapon to be a larger, double edged version of the first. Wait a second. The effectiveness of any magical circuits created through Enchant depend on the shape of the weapon, right? I guess that means I should probably make it all flowy and streamlined and stuff, since I’m going to be casting a lot of water magic. What if… I made it look like a drop of water? Yeah, that could be cool.And so, I followed my heart and created the exact item I had just described.“…” I was rendered speechless by the “greatsword” that lay in my hands. Though iron had been the only thing used in its creation, the resulting weapon was tinted with a dim shade of blue. I looked at its handle and traced my eyes along it to find the “blade,” which looked… exactly like a drop of water. A fat, stubby drop of water.“Wow! It looks just like Shii!”Illuna was spot on. The blade bore a striking resemblance to our resident slime.“…And what would that be?” asked Lefi, in a totally serious tone of voice.
“A uh… weapon. Yeah, a weapon.”
“Intriguing. Could you explain to me the method by which you intend to use it?”
“Uhhh… well… first, you grab it by the grip. And then you see the part that has all those like… watery markings on it? Yeah, you use that to just smash stuff. Yeah.”
“I see,” nodded the dragon girl. “I do admit, it appears quite powerful.”Wat? How? I. Really? What?I felt the urge to breathe a sigh of relief. Thank god I didn’t use any mithril on this. Would’ve been heartbreaking to waste so much DP on what ended up as an oversized piece of junk. Oh man, it would’ve taken forever to recoup the cost.“A-Anyway, whatever. Moving on.”I once again began scrolling through the catalogue and reached for the button to purchase a hefty chunk of iron, but stopped myself right before I did. Wait! I still had that one thing!Instead of buying another ingot, I instead opened up my inventory and grabbed one of the black pointy things I had lying around inside of it. A single glance was all that was needed to immediately identify the object as a horn. Specifically, it was one I’d looted off a monster that was basically just a rhinoceros beetle the size of a car. The beetle had torn up massive trees with said horn with ease. And upon killing it, I’d obviously ripped it off the monster’s corpse because it had seemed like a handy thing to have around.Observing the horn again reminded me that it was of a decent size and had a fair amount of weight to it. It was obviously far harder than wood given its ability to tear right through the trunks of trees. Which means it’s pretty much the perfect material for a greatsword!I had been using iron because I assumed it was the standard material used in weapons, but according to the part of my brain that knew a lot more about Monster H*nter than was otherwise necessary, there was no problem with making use of the horn. Alright Yuki, enough of that. Focus. No more random bullshit, no more whims. Just focus. All you need to do is make something simple. Sharp. Decently heavy. That’s it. Don’t bother overcomplicating the blade’s shape either. All you need is for it to have a grip and be double edged. Two thirds of my remaining magical energy flowed into the horn as I sharpened the mental image of the weapon I wished to produce. The mana cost was only as high as it was because the horn was a far better material than the iron ingots I’d been using to date.And so, after most of my mana had been drained, I finally activated the skill. I happened to see Lefi approach me with a huge grin plastered all over her face the moment I did. She moved right beside me and whispered into my ear. “F. L. O. W. E. R.”Wait what? Flower?“HOLD UP! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT!?”The skill had activated and crafted a weapon based on the image I had in mind. From the sword’s grip extended a blade, or rather, a stalk. A stalk with a flower blossoming atop it.Analyzing it produced the follow menu page.***Demon Lord’s Greatsword: A beautiful weapon crafted by a Demon Lord by the name of Yuki. A flower blossoms from its tip. Quality: A-***My thoughts had been interrupted at the last second; Lefi had made me suddenly think of a flower near the very end of the transmutation process. And as a result, the sword had morphed to take on the form of well… a flower. Oh come the fuck on! Why the hell did it have to have this retardedly good quality rating too! “W-what the hell, Lefi!?” I stammered.Weapon Transmutation didn’t allow me to ever retransmute anything that had already gone through the transmutation process. The skill could never be used on the same target twice, and my mana had already stopped flowing through the item. The process was done. There was no turning back.The horn I had used in the process was the only I had. It was of course possible for me to hunt another beetle, but I had no doubt that the process would be time consuming as all hell. I’d yet to see any others of its kind.In other words, I was going to have to live with the fact that the flower-blade I had in hand had become my most powerful weapon.“What a beautiful flower,” said Lefi between stifled laughs. “It is both beautiful and a functional weapon. How impressive!”
“You do know I only had one of those, right?”
“I fail to see the problem. You simply have to use the sword you have in hand,” said the dragon girl. A bit of a giggle escaped her lips each time she started a new sentence. “I am sure it will allow you to slay many a monster.”The dragon girl was unable to hold her laughter any longer. She fell onto the floor and started rolling around with her arms wrapped around her sides. Her laughter was so loud that it resounded throughout the entire throne room.“God damned childish little shit… At first I just thought you looked childish, but you totally act like a god damned brat…” I grumbled. “The first spell you taught me was some weird flower shit too. Makes it pretty obvious that something’s up with you and flowers. Hah! What a fair maiden you are, oh great Supreme Dragon. To think that you would like both flowers and sweets!”“I-I fail to find fault in my preferences!” cried Lefi, indignantly. “And they are of little importance to begin with! They matter not!”
“I mean, I really don’t care what you’re into. You do you. Only complaint I’ve got is that they really don’t suit your image. Iunno about you, but when people say the world’s strongest dragon, I really don’t think up some snot nosed brat.”
“You dare! That is a claim I cannot forgive!” roared the dragon girl. “Very well! I shall illustrate to you what it means to pick a fight with none other than the Supreme Dragon!”
“Supreme Dragon, my ass!” I shouted back. “You keep going on and on about that fancy title of yours, but you ain’t got shit! All you do is laze around like a potato! Supreme Dragon? More like Subjugated Dragon if you ask me!”
“I cannot believe you! You dare insult my title again!?” Lefi stamped her feet against the ground as she reddened with rage. “Prepare yourself, Yuki! For I shall show you the reason for which the term Hell was defined!”The vampire girl observing our argument heaved a heavy sigh before turning towards her pet slime and speaking in a barely audible tone. “Ugh, they’re doing it again. Come on, Shii. Let’s go play somewhere else.”Although the flower-blade pissed me off, it had great stats, so I ended up doing exactly as Lefi said and used it as my main weapon for quite some time. God damn it… I need more materials…***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like our resident Demon Lord is learning how to make his weapons on his own. Very nice, very nice. Now if only he can concentrate without being affected by external stimuli. Thank you, Lefi, for pointing that weakness out to him. Pft. A Demon Lord wielding a flower sword. If that was in an RPG I played, I wouldn’t be taking that boss seriously. Like, at all. I’d go off, grind up to max level, get the ultimate weapons, come back and say “I’m your god now, boy” before smashing him and his flower sword to pieces. But yeah, concentration is pretty important to have. Casting magic, using skills, most all of these require concentration. So sharpen that up, boy. You’ve got a long way to go to be a drill sergeant, kid. So don’t even try. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Series of Thoughts on the Man Named Yuki
Editor(s): Joker, SpeedphoenixI have never found it a simple task to succinctly describe the man known as Yuki. The most appropriate approximation is to label him bizarre, for I find him both peculiar and incomprehensible. “How come Yuki’s okay even though he just fell out of the sky?” Evidently, the child situated by my side felt the same. She too was questioning the sanity of his actions.
“An excellent question, young one…” I paused for a moment to consider the most optimal way to answer her question. It would be best for me not to disrupt the girl’s understanding of normalcy. “The cause is a magical pendant he retains on his person. It negates the impact of the fall.”I momentarily directed my gaze towards the child, the dungeon’s newest resident, only to immediately turn it upon the Demon Lord once more.Bearing witness to his wild antics once again reminded me of the tales that he had told. I was impressed. His plots were so well spun that they lead my heart to pound with excitement in a manner unbefitting my age. I felt like a child before the unheard tales that he presented us, one after another.His stories were not the only new experiences he presented. The items he produced and the knowledge he demonstrated fell into the realm of the unknown on many an occasion. I was only a hair’s breadth away from thinking him wise. I was stopped, however, by his complete and utter lack of common sense. He would often know not what even I found obvious. His wealth of knowledge appears discontinuous, incongruent, and mismatched. And that was precisely the reason for which I thought him mysterious. At first, I suspected that the fault lay with his origin. He was only recently born into this world as a Demon Lord. However, I soon came to understand that there was fault in my suspicions. His status as the master of a dungeon could not possibly have reflected his oddities. He acts in a manner distinct from any other Demon Lord I had ever encountered.There was no simple way for me to put the concept into words. However, I was able to conclude that the differences lay with his aura. Yuki bears a presence that brings with it great comfort, and it is for that reason that he holds the ability to draw other individuals to his side. I was certain that the young girl by my side had felt the same, that she was drawn towards him because she intuitively understood that he held the ability to calm the hearts of those in his vicinity. I daresay that his ability to render those around him at ease is akin to a magic spell.While I had not any definite answer, I suspected that the key lay with his personality. Yuki is unrestrained. He does not hide his emotions, and he speaks with a frankness that is almost innocent in its expression. It is odd. He both does and does not give the impression that he is capable of managing his affairs and taking charge of his own well being. Truly, I fail to understand him. But alas, even this sort of elaborate description fails to capture the entire essence of the man known as Yuki. I can only conclude that he differs from any other. I had spent many of the past centuries enduring a wave of boredom. There had been nothing for me to do. The same could not be said for the preceding era. The world had been filled with conflict and unrest. Many senseless imbeciles had attempted to challenge my might. I found that engaging them in combat served as the perfect way to kill time, and so, I fought. I fought, fought, and continued to fight until one day, I found myself dubbed the Supreme Dragon. And that was when the embers of conflict burned their last. All those that confronted me were filled with naught but fear of my title. The challengers began to wither away. Even my fellow dragons prostrated before me despite being born into this world as its most powerful race.I became an avatar of terror.Yuki was different. At first, he too had been overwhelmed by the difference in our strengths. However, he soon lowered his guard and began acting in a manner I could only describe as brazen. It did not take long for him to begin refuting my will. I was shocked. He was the first with which I had ever engaged a verbal quarrel. And to this day, I know not whether he knows no fear or if he has simply overcome it.Yuki was the first to see me not as the Supreme Dragon, but as an individual. As Leficios. I cannot deny that I find it both fresh and pleasant.He was the first and only to have ever provided me comfort with his mere presence. I know not when my time with him will end… but I very much wish to continue immersing myself in the comfort he brings me. At least for just a little longer.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like we get a sneak peek inside the thought process of our favorite Supreme Dragon. Could those be the embers of a relationship starting to flare up I sense? Maybe, maybe not. Only time will tell, after all. Also, Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone! I hope that this chapter finds you in good cheer. If not, maybe the fact that there is a chapter to read, albeit a small one, gives you some good cheer. Alas, with such a short chapter, I really don’t have anything more to say. Usually, I’d pull something from the chapter and talk about that, but I really can’t this time. So sorry, everyone. I know you all enjoy reading these notes (I hope). But I’ll have to end it here for now. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Character Summary
Editor(s): Joker, SpeedphoenixCharacters Affiliated With the Dungeon
Yuki
Class: Demon Lord
Race: Archdemon
Notable Traits: Dungeon Master, Protagonist.
Description: Yuki was once a human, but strangely enough, he does not mind the fact that he has traded his humanity for his status as a Demon Lord. He is, for the most part, able to take care of himself. He has wings composed of magical energy, but he keeps them retracted during his everyday life because he finds that they tend to get in the way. Yuki tends to be rather shameless, but is still embarrassed by the fact that his magic eye skill had turned one of his eyes a deep crimson nonetheless.Leficios
Nickname: Lefi
Class: Supreme Dragon
Race: Ancient Dragon
Notable Traits: Platinum hair.
Description: Lefi is very knowledgeable, but it doesn’t show too often due to her childish, selfish nature. She has recently discovered that remaining in her human form is rather comfortable, and thus, she has seldom reverted to her dragon form. She loves sweets. She had once kept her preferences hidden because she felt that her tastes failed to reflect her image. However, Yuki’s discovery of it had led her to decide that there was no point in attempting to keep her love of sweets hidden. She now asks him for them every single day. The humans see her as a thing of legend.Illuna
Race: Vampire (Demon)
Notable Traits: Blonde, little Girl, innocent.
Description: Illuna, like Shii, brings solace to the dungeon’s residents. Her favourite food is Yuki’s blood. While the idea seems rather psychotic, it is in fact normal behaviour for members of her race. She is actually quite intelligent. While she was unable to beat Lefi in Othello at first, she soon became better at the game than any of the dungeon’s other residents. However, she doesn’t want anyone else to find out about her abilities, so she often loses on purpose. Yuki has noticed the signs and now spends his days living in fear that Illuna will eventually grow up into a cunning, manipulative woman. Neither Yuki nor Lefi have caught on to the fact that she has a few hidden titles and skills.Dungeon Affiliated Monsters
Shii
Race: Slime
Notable Traits: Cute pet.
Description: Shii is the first monster that Yuki ever summoned. Yuki has yet to realize it, but the slime has actually gained quite a number of levels over time. It loves to sleep and spends much of its time napping. Its favorite spot is on top of one of the cushions. Napping aside, the slime spends its days playing with Yuki, Illuna, and even Lefi on occasion.Fluffrir
Nickname: Rir
Race: Fenrir
Notable Traits: Pessimistic.
Description: Fluffir is, by all means, a legendary creature that deserves to proudly stand shoulder to shoulder with Lefi. However, all the dungeon’s other residents treat him like the resident newbie. Hence, he is often stuck playing with Illuna and Shii. He finds most of his meals by hunting monsters within the dungeon’s territory.Extras
Reyus, Lurolle, and Griffa: Adventurers based in a human city. They are the first extras to have names and exist to pave the way for many other extras to come. They might show up again, if they’re lucky.<– Prev — Next –>

The Incident
Editor(s): SpeedphoenixThree of my five senses were subjected to a heavy assault. My ears had to endure the sound of a viscous liquid flow down the throat of a fair maiden while her warmth was conveyed to me through her skin on mine. As she was still just a child, her body temperature was higher than the standard thirty six and a half degrees; her touch was so hot I felt it would light me aflame. Most powerful of all however, was the assault on my sense of smell. The sweet scent coming off her body tempted me to take deep breaths and inhale as much of it as I could.Only after what felt like an eternity did Illuna finally detach herself from my neck, sighing in satisfaction as she did. “Thanks Yuki! That was really tasty!”The vampire happily smiled as she wiped the corners of her mouth. And only then did I return to my senses. The way my blood had dribbled down the sides of her cheeks had been so bewitching that I couldn’t help but but stare ‘till it was gone. The contrast between her joy and the almost gruesome scene made her seem like something along the lines of a tiny, adorable manifestation of the devil himself. I could almost picture an even smaller version of her sitting on my shoulder and whispering immoral temptations straight into my mind.“A-anytime.” I replied to the girl’s expression of gratitude by averting my gaze. The tone in which I spoke was dry and husky, a result of severe mental exhaustion. God damn it. I kind of hate how we have to do this whole bloodsucking thing. I mean, don’t get me wrong. I don’t particularly mind giving Illuna my blood, but this whole damned thing feels like a test of my mental fortitude. Keeping myself in check until she’s done ain’t no walk in the park. Shit’s as hard as stopping myself from getting pulled through Hell’s gates. Man, Illuna’s scary. I’d never been one of the “gentlemen” that advocated the classic Japanese phrase “yes lolita, no touch,” but even I was finding it ridiculously hard to resist her charms.“I love your blood! It’s really tasty and drinking it makes me all happy.” Illuna elaborated as I shivered in my metaphorical boots. Her tone was cheerful, and for some odd reason, reminded me of an elder sibling praising a dish cooked by one of their little brothers or sisters.“Does the blood’s source really change its taste that much?”
“Mhm! Totally!” The young vampire crouched herself into a ball before standing up and stretching her legs and arms as far as they could go in order to emphasize the idea. That’s adorable. “Your blood has a really nice, mild flavour. It goes down really smoothly too! It’s so good I think it has me hooked! And best of all, having you inside me makes me really warm and happy!”
“I-I see. I guess I’ll be taking that as a compliment.” I forced a smile and nodded. Ooookay there, time out little lady. You better not be saying that in public. I’d probably get taken straight to court if anyone else heard you.
“Okay! Now that I’m done, I’m going to go play outside!”
“Alright, have fun. Don’t go too far. And make sure you come back before it gets dark, okay?”
“Kaaay!”The little girl gave an energetic reply before leaving the throne room.But despite telling me that she would, Illuna never returned.Not even after the sun had long made its way beyond the horizon.***“Have you found her, Rir!?” I dashed up to the wolf and began to question him the moment he entered the room. It looked like he was intending on making a report, but shelved it in order to answer my question; he apologetically shook his head from left to right.Fuck! I cursed and ground my teeth against one another as my mind flew into a state of panic. Where did I go wrong? Should I have been more strict? Was letting her do whatever she wanted why this all happened!? Shit!Shii, clearly worried, nestled itself against me in an attempt to help abate my anxiety.“Yeah, you’re right, Shii. It’ll all be okay.” I began taking deeper breaths. Alright Yuki, calm down. No point getting your panties in a knot. Panicking isn’t going to help anyone.“Right. Sorry. What were you trying to tell me earlier, Rir?” I spoke again after fully calming myself down.Following Illuna’s scent had led Rir to discover that she had not upped and left on her own accord. A group of human scents had suddenly appeared alongside hers and extended all the way out the forest. In other words, our resident vampire had been kidnapped. Rir had hurried back to ask my opinion immediately upon discovering that the trail that lay outside the forest’s boundaries had relatively fresh marks on it, ones that could only have been left behind by some sort of wagon or carriage.It was a good call. There was no knowing exactly how far the kidnappers had gotten. I had no doubt that even Rir would struggle to retrieve her if they’d already made it to some sort of large scale settlement. He was a Fenrir, a powerful legendary creature, but even he had his limits, especially seeing as how he was apparently still fairly young.Although I absolutely detested the fact that Illuna had been kidnapped, I did have to admit that it was at least better than the alternative. It would’ve long been too late if she’d been attacked by some sort of monster. The fact that it was just a kidnapping meant we still had a chance to save her. But who would do such a thing?A moment of thought was more than enough to lead me to a conclusion. She’d been pretty deep in the forest. We were fairly close to the forest’s inner sanctum, and because I often checked my map, I knew that Illuna preferred to remain near the throne room. She would occasionally wander into the forest, but even then, she’d never ventured too far. Her captors had to have come to her, not the other way around.The humans thought of both Lefi’s territory and the forest around it as uncharted territory. They knew that entering it was dangerous and that it was in their best interest to stay away. There was no reason for anyone to venture this deep without reason. The kidnappers had to have known that Illuna was here. She was clearly their target. In other words, the only possible answer to my question was that they were slave traders. They were the people that Illuna had escaped right before she became one of the dungeon’s residents.Identifying the men responsible for her disappearance immediately rendered their motives clear as day. They were only willing to go as far as to wander into a forest filled with dangerous monsters because of the young vampire’s beauty. It was obvious to them that she would sell for more than just a pretty penny. Hell, they might even have already a buyer lined up and ready. And that… would be bad. Real bad. If they’ve already got someone waiting, then there’s a good chance she’ll have slipped out of my grasp come morning.“Lefi, are there any human settlements nearby?”
“There is one to the southeast. A mere two hours by flight, if my memory serves me correctly.”Two hours? That’s it? Oh, wait. Going by flight means you don’t really have to avoid stuff, so that’s gotta be based on the straight line distance. Makes sense, if I think about it that way.“…”I had intended on continuing my train of thought, but was interrupted by the sudden surge of a dark, murky emotion. Fuck. You. Fuck all of you! How dare you touch Illuna!? I’m going to fuck you bastards up so badly that you’ll beg me to kill you!Seething hatred dyed everything before me a shade of red as I reached into my inventory and produced from it a crude looking greatsword, the flower-blade’s successor. Its shape wasn’t anything special, but the blade possessed both the power and weight I desired. It was more than enough to smash a human or two to bits. Its name was the Violet Carving Knife. I managed to embed it with the magical circuit I’d learned from boosting the Enchant skill’s level by one: Inflict Lesser Poison. The spell could be activated by pouring mana through the blade, at which point it would gain the ability to inject venom into anything it cut.Though the skill described its secretion as a “lesser poison,” it was by no means truly weak. Its inferiority came from its efficiency. That is, the poison secreted was only weak relative to the amount of magic invested in it. And said amount was a variable. I’d already confirmed that it was possible for me to use my ridiculous mana pool to load it with a near excessive amount of magic. In testing, the poison had become so powerful that it caused the area around the cut to immediately turn a shade of purple. I was quite dying with anticipation. I couldn’t wait to see the strength of a weapon enchanted with a poisoning spell with a higher efficiency rating.“Alright, let’s go Rir. Show me where Illuna’s scent leads. As for you, Shii, I’mma have to ask you to stay home.”The slime jiggled about in protest.“I know how you feel, but that’s just how it has to be. Sorry,” I said. “But don’t worry. I’ll make sure she gets home in one piece.”I turned towards the dragon girl after issuing orders to my monsters.“Lefi, could you do me a favour and come with us?”
“I see not why you would assume otherwise. I too consider that youngling a member of my household, my brood.” The dragon crossed her arms and made closed her eyes in a manner that relaid a state of rage. “I too seek to deliver retribution to her assailants. However, I must ask for you to wait.”
“Wait? What for?”
“That, you shall soon discover.” A fearless grin appeared on Lefi’s face as she turned to face the cave’s entrance. “What impeccable timing. They have now arrived. I have gathered all that lay in our vicinity.”
“All what?”
“After me.”
“???”I couldn’t make heads or tails of what Lefi was getting at, but did as instructed and followed her to the cave’s entrance regardless. Tracing her gaze, I noticed several… dots along the horizon. I couldn’t tell what they were at first. But once they drew close enough, I recognized them. Dragons. Lefi had called for dragons.They were so numerous that their massive, bulky frames had ended up blotting out the sky. Not a single member of the brood was a wyvern or any other sort of draconic subspecies. They were all true dragons. Their stats matched those of the forest’s most powerful creatures, the ones that reigned over the land to the west.“Who are they?”
“I supposed it is most accurate to label them my… subordinates. I had suspected that their assistance may prove useful in uncovering Illuna’s whereabouts. However, it appears that our goals have undergone a minor shift.” A cocky grin appeared on the silver-haired girl’s face. “Humans are creatures often too stupid to identify those that are more powerful than them. I am certain that it would do us no harm to arrive at their gates with an entourage, for it will reinforce the power we hold over them.”So that’s what she was doing this whole time. I had thought that Lefi was just sitting by and quietly idling the time away, but it turned out that she too had involved herself in our search.“God damn, Lefi.” A smirk appeared on my face. “You sure are one helluva woman.”
“And you have only realized that now?” She smirked back. “It is about time.”I couldn’t deny her words. They were true. Lefi always had been one real good catch.“Now, Yuki, let us be off, for we must pick up the girl that has functioned as a younger sibling to us?”
“Yeah, let’s. I’ll be counting on you, partner.”The dragon girl’s only reply was a fearless laugh as she once again turned towards the dragons.Sit tight, Illuna.We’ll be right there. I promise.<– Prev — Next –>

Caged
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“Mmmnnnn…?” Illuna groaned as she awoke to a foreign sensation. The warm and soft fluffiness of her Japanese-styled bed was nowhere to be found. She was lying on top of something hard, stiff and cold. And it was precisely the surface’s lack of comfort that wrenched her from her dreams.A bit of a frown crossed her face as she sat up. Her vision was still blurry, so she rubbed her eyes before looking around. The first thing she saw was a series of evenly spaced, iron bars. Situated right above her head was yet another flat chunk of metal; the cage she was in was so short that it didn’t even allow her to stand.The stark disparity between the sight before her and the one she had expected jolted the young vampire awake. A sense of malaise urged her to look down at her own neck, where she found the exact item she’d expected: a collar. The metal ring around her neck was just as obtuse as the broad chain that affixed it to the bottom of the cage. Magical energy emanated from Illuna’s collar. She could tell that it was enchanted with a spell meant to prevent her escape.Bright as she was, the vampire discerned her circumstances with ease. She had been captured and locked away. She immediately began to search through her memories in order to identify when it had happened.A gasp escaped her lips as she recalled it.It had happened while she was playing outdoors. A pair of men had jumped out of the foliage and doused her in some sort of strange liquid. And then, everything had gone black.Illuna’s eyes restlessly darted around her surroundings. The room was dim. It was hard to see too much about her surroundings, but she was at least able to make out that she wasn’t alone. The room was filled with cages no different from her own. She spotted within them a girl with animal ears, a girl with sheep-like horns, and many others. The list went on, but each and every single person on it was female. There were no men. Only women.Gender aside, the women had little in common. There were many different species, all with their own quirks and traits. The only thing they truly shared was that their eyes were filled with despair. They were so deprived of hope that even Illuna, a young child, could make out their suffering.Despite her initial confusion, Illuna was able to decipher the situation she now found herself in. But of course, that, in and of itself, meant not that she had a solution. And she wasn’t given much time to think.A pair of footsteps echoed through the room, gradually growing louder as their owners approached. Soon, she saw them.“Shit, we was hella lucky there. I thoughts we was gonna die.”
“Talk about it man. I was just thinkin’ that we were about to end up in some ditch with monsters eating us ‘live. Fuckin’ scary.”The men strode straight across the room and headed for her cage, their footsteps reverberating on the stone floor below all along the way. They were captors. And more. They were a part of the group that had attacked her village and slaughtered her kin.“Well, would ya look at that? Little bitch ain’t sleepin’ no more!” One of the men grinned sadistically as he looked her in the eye. “Fuck’s sake, you little brat. You know how much fuckin’ shit you put us through? Fuck you!”The man drove his fist through the cage and right into Illuna’s face. There was so much force behind the attack that it knocked her away and made her smash the back of her head into the cage’s bars. So intense was the pain that it caused tears to seep from Illuna’s eyes.“Man, fuck. I know how you is feelin’ right now, but you gotta make sure you don’t damage the merch. The boss’ll beat the shit out of us if you hurt her so bad that her value drops. Shiet. Y’already know that she’s gun end up fuckin’ that one child-loving noble we gunna be sellin’ her to, so calm yo ass down,” said the second man.
“Tsk.” The first man clicked his tongue and frowned. “Fine.”That said, he didn’t withdraw his hands. In fact, he reached into the cage and grabbed Illuna by the hair, forcing her to face him. He looked her right in the eyes and spoke in a tone dripping with malice. “Now listen here, y’little shit. You’re doomed. You’re about to end up as a whore that gets bedded by an old man that loves fuckin’ the shit outta kids. He’s gunna play with you erry single day. It’ll be so bad you’ll wish you was dead. Ain’t that just gun’ be great?”The smile on the man’s face was so revulsive that Illuna couldn’t stand to look at it. Her body rejected it on a physiological level. The combination of his mug, which was uglier than a brain damaged pig’s, and his words made the young girl want to cry for reasons other than just the pain assailing the back of her head.But she held it in.Because she knew.Because she knew that Yuki would come for her.Her impression of the man was that he was nice and warm. Though she was scared of him at first, she now regarded him with her eyes full of affection. Thinking of him was all she needed to do to bear with her suffering.She had been alone the last time she suffered at the humans’ hands. The destruction of her village and the death of her family had left her with no one to lean on. But that was no longer true. She had her kind adopted brother. So long as she persevered, he would come. And Lefi would too. Illuna’s impression of the dragon was that, while she was lazy, she was someone that could be relied on. She could always be relied on when push came to shove.Both her adopted brother and her adopted sister were incredibly powerful. They could defeat the monsters that the villagers had always told her to steer clear of with ease.“Tsk.” Again, the man that attacked her clicked his tongue. He swivelled around, as if bored by her lack of a response, and spoke to his companion as he left the room. “Fuck this. Let’s go.”***Illuna’s supervisors were gone. With her captors at bay, the child was finally able to rub her eyes, get ahold of herself, and put her mind to work.She knew that she couldn’t just sit around and wait for her rescuers. Experience taught her that wailing in sorrow was not the way to salvation. Help wasn’t something that just fell into one’s lap. If she wanted to live, then she had to act.But she didn’t know where she was. She didn’t know where to run. Escape was off her list of options.So what could she do?The answer the little girl arrived at was that she could stall for time. She could hide to ensure that she would be able to wait until her family arrived.“Spirits of the earth, please lend me your power.” She spoke in an energetic tone, as if to drive off the sense of helplessness assaulting her mind.A dim, brown light almost seemed to appear out of thin air in response to her words. Its shine was so dull that it was almost unnoticeable in the dark, but there nonetheless. The interaction that had just occurred was one only made possible by one of the vampire’s titles: Blessing of the Spirit Lord.It granted her Yggdrasil’s blessing, which allowed her to cast spirit sorcery and detect those with ill will. One of the title’s additional effects was to mask both its existence, and that of the spell it granted. And it was effective. Neither Yuki nor Lefi had caught on.Yggdrasil’s protection was what allowed Illuna to escape her pursuers the first time. And it was also what had kept the Wicked Forest’s monsters from killing her.“Spirit of the earth, please unlock both my collar and cage,” said the girl.The spirit almost seem to nod before moving towards Illuna’s collar. And then, it vanished. It had almost looked like the collar had sucked it in. Before long came a metallic click; Illuna’s fetters had become undone.Of course, as Illuna had already escaped once, the slavers had chosen to lock her down with a magically enhanced tool to ensure that she would be unable to pull the wool over their heads a second time. But their methods were wrong. Spirits were creatures that ate, acted as mediums for, and even embodied magical energy.And as enchanted items needed magical energy to operate, breaking one was a task that any spirit would find simple. All they had to do was consume all the item’s magical energy, draining it dry and rendering it invalid.After completing its first task, the light darted through the air and entered the cage’s keyhole to complete its second task. Again, there was a metal click, and Illuna was set free. Double checking to make sure that both the collar came off and the door opened, Illuna thanked the earth spirit and dismissed it. In its place, she called for the spirit of darkness.There were six different types of spirits, fire, water, earth, wind, light, and darkness. Each specialized in a different type of magic and had different properties they could easily manipulate. The earth spirit, for example, could manipulate soil, minerals, metals, and everything else of a similar vein. Likewise, the darkness spirit worked with the shadows and could leverage and bend them to its will.Illuna looked around before activating the spirit’s power. She wanted to save all the others. But she knew that it was a poor choice. Releasing them would surely cause a commotion, so she didn’t. Instead, she swore not to abandon them. She pledged that she would release them as soon as her beloved brother came to her rescue.“Thank you, spirit of darkness.”And so, with the spirit’s power, Illuna faded into the shadows. No other slave, nor slave driver, was aware of her disappearance. Her magic had left them all none the wiser.Editor’s note: Today’s editor’s note has been canceled to Joker flying into a rage at how Illuna is being treated. He will returned calmed down once Yuki arrives. See y’all in the next chapter. *in the background* THOSE DICKLESS LUMPS OF PURE SHIT! I’M GOING TO SHOVE THEIR FUCKING *censored* SO FAR UP THEIR ASSES, THEY’LL HAVE TO PUT THEIR FACES UP TO THE TOILET BOWL TO PISS!<– Prev — Next –>

Strife in Alfyro
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Joker
“Ugh…” Alfyro’s governor groaned as he awoke to the sound of someone banging on his door. “What’s with all this noise?”
“Governor Raylow! Are you awake?! We have a dire situation on our hands!” A familiar voice called to Raylow from beyond his door. It belonged to one of his subordinates, a magistrate under his employ.
“What is it this time? Are we under attack? Is it a group of monsters?” The feudal lord pressed a hand against his face as he slowly sat up.
“That’s exactly it! A flock of one hundred has been spotted flying towards us. They seem to be coming from the Wicked Forest!”The magistrate’s words caused Raylow’s eyes to shoot open; all his drowsiness was instantly blown away.“Tsk.” The governor clicked his tongue in annoyance. “So it is finally happening. You said that the monsters were airborne? Are they wyverns?”
“No, sir.” The magistrate hesitated and took a deep breath before continuing his report. “The men have used the Crystal of Observation to confirm our assailants’ identities. They were Full Dragons.”
“What!?” Raylow was so shocked by the revelation that his jaw dropped as far as it would go.The term Full Dragon referred to a member of the Dragon Race that had reached adulthood. In other words, it was a general descriptor for the world’s most powerful creatures. Each Full Dragon was so powerful that it would need a whole party of adamantite ranked adventurers, literal one man armies, to take it down. And there were a whole hundred approaching the city.It was literally the worst possible scenario Raylow could fathom, one that would lead to the destruction of not just his city, but his entire country should he fail to resolve it.“Rouse the guards and all the adventurers we have standing by. Have them gather and prepare for combat immediately. Inform the public of the emergency and have the citizens evacuate immediately!”The magistrate dashed out of the governor’s room and began executing his instructions as quickly as he could. It didn’t take long for the whole manor to follow suit.Like the rest of his staff members, the governor got straight to work. He got off his bed, put on a simple, baggy garment, and headed straight to his office.Raylow had known that something was bound to happen. He had received reports telling him of the abnormalities within the Wicked Forest. And so, he had increased the number of combatants under his employ. But, even with his forces bolstered, he doubted they would prove to be of any use at all against a hundred dragons.But still, he hoped. He hoped that they would at least be able to hold until he evacuated his people.He knew very well that this night would likely be his last. And yet, he hurried to his office. To take command. And to play the role of the tragic hero if need be.***The draconic brood soared through the moonlit sky. Contrary to my expectations, their ranks were orderly. Their coordination was so perfect that I was tempted to think they were all working under a single consciousness, that they were all parts of the same whole.The dragons followed Lefi’s orders to the letter. I was impressed at how tight a grasp she had on them, even if it happened to be because they were disproportionately terrified of her. While each and every creature present was powerful in its own right, they were nothing before the strongest member of their species. The disparity between her and them was so high that she could end any of them in an instant. And for that reason, none dared to defy her. The thought likely didn’t even cross their minds. That was just the sort of world this was. Strength was everything; it made little sense for the weak to disobey the obscenely powerful.Below us was Rir. The wolf’s speed was ungodly. He had no trouble keeping up with the dragons despite having to traverse the terrain.“There it is!” I shouted as I spotted the human settlement, the city, off in the distance. It was still quite a ways away. I would never have been able to see it from so far had my eyes been as they were while I was still human.Encompassing the city was a solid, outer wall. A bulwark. The settlement itself was quite large. It was way bigger than the tiny town I’d expected to see. And though it was the middle of the night, it was still bustling with activity. Much of the city was lit, and people seemed to be moving through its streets in a hurry. Outside its walls stood a division of fully armed guards. We were still a fair distance away, but they’d already seen us coming. They probably have some sort of item that lets them see or detect us. Either way, I found myself face to face with a city in another world. Man, I really would’ve liked to visit this place in some other capacity. Like, you know, without an army of dragons in tow.“Yuki.” Lefi, who’d been at the front of the formation, dropped out of it in order to align herself beside me. She was still in her humanoid form, albeit the variation in which she had wings.
“Yeah?”
“I have little choice but to admit that it would not be wise for me to unleash my power upon this settlement. Illuna would likely perish should I raze it to the ground. You will need to retrieve the little lady yourself.”
“Got it. But you better make sure you keep the dragons under control while I’m down there, ‘kay?”
“Those were precisely my intentions all along.”We passed over the city’s walls as Lefi answered, so, after nodding to her, I promptly folded my wings and descended upon the city, dodging any arrows and spells haphazardly fired in my direction as I did.There was a loud thud accompanied by a cloud of dust as I landed. The force of the impact coursed through my entire body, but I didn’t mind it. Rir soon followed. He cleared the city’s walls with ease and dashed along the rooftops until finally arriving at my side.“Can you smell her, Rir!?”The wolf growled in affirmation as he turned his head to face away from the wall that we’d just breached.“Perfect. Lead the way!” I wrapped my arm around his neck and hopped onto his back in a single, fluid motion. After ensuring that I was secure, the wolf burst into a full on sprint. Armed men, the city’s guards, passed us by as we moved, but we paid them no mind.Their goal was to investigate the spot in which I’d landed.And ours was to save Illuna.That was all.There was no point to eliminating or contesting them.***It only took Rir a few minutes worth of bounding across rooftops to trace Illuna’s scent to its source.The two of us found ourselves in front of an estate that was significantly larger than those around it. It was clear that whoever owned it had more than their fair share of influence.We’re finally here. I closed my eyes in an attempt to suppress my rage. This… is where those child trafficking shitlords run their operations. But I couldn’t.A feral scream escaped my lips as I leapt off Rir’s back. I drew my greatsword in midair and smashed it into the building’s entrance. The flimsy front door was blown away by the force of the attack, completely destroyed.“The fuck!?”
“Shit! What the hell was that, and who the hell are you!?”Two of the crude looking men shouted in surprise at my sudden entrance, but I ignored them and looked around. The venue I had entered looked to be the interior of some sort of store. Man, whoever did the interior design around here has got a serious case of having shit taste. The walls, furnishings, and decorations all looked like utter crap. But worst of all was the stupid, gaudy chandelier situated right beside the grand staircase leading to the second floor. It was the kind of thing you’d only ever see in a building owned by a member of the nouveau riche.Apparently, I had caught the men in the middle of their escape—or at least their preparations for it. They were obviously ruffians. If their appearances weren’t enough to give that away, then their actions were. They were dragging around a series of chains, each connected to a young maiden with an uncomfortable looking metallic collar around her neck.And although Illuna wasn’t amongst them, the scene was one that pissed me off to no end. It was so infuriating, in fact, that it prompted me to gnash my teeth together in frustration. First, you kidnap Illuna. And now, you show me this. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. Just how much do you fucking dick sucking shitwads plan to piss me off?“Do it! Now!” One of the men, a supposed leader, gave his lackies a vague order. And though I didn’t know the way their business operated, I understood just as well as anyone else that he’d told them to attack because he’d judged me a threat to the operation.A few of the underlings violently pushed the enslaved girls into another room while the rest drew their weapons and attacked me all at once. Well, I suppose there isn’t much harm in ending a lowlife or two.The closest man raised his mace above his head and leapt straight at me. He was a good bit ahead of his companions, and sure to be credited for the kill if his attack landed. Keyword: if. I retaliated before he could so much as lower his arms. I casually lifted my greatsword with one arm and gave it a nonchalant sweep.I felt both the sensation of tearing through meat and the sensation of rending bone as I severed the pitiful piece of flesh that connected his skull to his shoulders.His blood splattered all over everything nearby. And of course, I was no exception. A bit of red ended up dirtying my cheek as the man’s head rolled onto the floor.Although the men continued to angrily scream at me, seeing one of their allies immediately fall caused them to falter. They only remained intimidated for an instant, but that was more than enough to create the opening I needed. I dashed straight into their ranks while swinging my weapon with all the strength I could muster.A fair number of the slave traders managed to raise their weapons in time to catch my blade. But it didn’t matter. Both those that guarded and those that didn’t ended up falling prey to the attack, with the only difference being that the former of the two groups ended up getting smashed against the room’s walls, while the latter had their torsos separated from their legs.The greatsword’s ability to perform the exact feat that I had just demonstrated was the reason I had chosen it over its alternatives. My monstrous brute strength allowed me to dominate my foes regardless of whether or not I had mastered the corresponding techniques.“Die!”One of the men, the only one near me that had reacted by stepping out of my range, dashed at me and attempted to split me in two. His timing was good. But I wasn’t alone. The Fenrir I had entrusted my back to dashed up to the man and batted him in the chest with one of his front paws. So fast was the wolf that he disallowed the man a chance to react.Unable to withstand the attack, the lowlife’s chest caved. His ribs stabbed through the organs in his chest and instantly ended his life.“Fuck!” The man that looked to be in charge cursed. “This asshole’s a tamer! Get the thing! Now!”A group of grunts responded to the orders by quickly running into the building and returning with what looked like a crystal. They activated the magically enhanced item and caused it to begin emitting light.Rir seemed to suffer from a sudden moment of disorientation. His legs wobbled unsteadily, but he brushed it off and steadied himself immediately afterwards. The wolf’s expression, however, belayed that he was still feeling a sense of discomfort.“You okay?” I asked.The monster nodded in affirmation, but I highly doubted that he was telling the truth. I could tell that he wasn’t back to his best.I turned my eyes upon the item and analyzed it.***Crystal of Obstruction: This magically enhanced tool disorients monsters by disrupting the flow of magical energy within their bodies, thereby dulling their movements. The range of this effect is proportional to the strength of the monster it is affecting. Quality: B+***Oh. So that’s why these weak ass retards were able to make it so deep inside the forest. Learning of what happened to Illuna had left me with many doubts and unanswered questions. I knew that the humans considered the forest uncharted territory. Entering it was no different from gambling one’s life away. Yet, there’d been a pair brave enough to chase Illuna all the way into its depths.There was no way a single young girl was worth that much to the likes of a slaver. That was why I’d assumed that the humans were ridiculously powerful, which had never seemed quite right. And it turned out that my suspicions were correct. The humans weren’t powerful. They’d only made it as far as they had because of the tools they wielded. Which means I’ll have no problem butchering the rest.My emotions must’ve shown on my face, as the man in charge only grew more irritated as he gazed upon me. He didn’t bother hiding his annoyance as he continued spitting out his orders.“Ignore the fucking smirk on that asshole’s face! He’s just bluffin’! We all know tamers ain’t worth shit when their monsters are down, and we got way more men than he can handle! Surround him and take ‘im out!”What fucking retards. Did they not just see me tear through a whole bunch of them by myself? Or are their brains just so dysfunctional that they’ve still yet to process it?“I’ll be fine, Rir. Sit tight and let me handle this.” Rir tried to step in front of me even though he clearly wasn’t doing too well, so I spoke to him before turning to the slavers and casting a spell.“What!?” The boss screamed in shock as he witnessed the magical assault. The precise attack I chose was the usual, the one that created dragons out of jets of water.“Go.”The psuedodragons almost seemed to let loose joyful roars as they arced through the air, opened their maws, and swallowed the ruffians whole. Though they tried to struggle, the humans were incapable of escaping. There was nothing they could do but drown as the high speed currents shredded them to bits of blood and flesh.By the time the dragons were gone, so were they.The grunt-filled room had been reduced to a veritable hellscape. Corpses were lying around in piles, and entrails were splattered all over. Everything from the floor to the ceiling to all the furniture that lay about was dyed a deep shade of crimson.And I felt nothing. Looking at the wanton destruction I had caused didn’t fill me with guilt. The fact that I had killed not just one, but a whole group of human beings felt like exactly that: just a fact. I couldn’t bring myself to care for the moral ramifications of my actions. It was precisely this lack of a reaction that led me to understand that I truly had lost my humanity.“Well…” I sighed as I smashed the enchanted crystal with my greatsword. “That’s convenient, I guess.”It seemed I wouldn’t have to worry about hesitating while handing these lowlives their one way tickets to hell.“Hey Rir, where’s Illuna?”The wolf growled apologetically. The smell of blood was too strong for him to discern her exact location. Oh well. That’s fine too, I guess. All that means is I gotta go around killing everyone I run into until they spill the beans. I’m sure I’ll run into someone that knows where she is eventually.***Editor’s note: Yes. YES. Kill them all Yuki. Leave none alive. Murder and burn the scum until naught remains but ashes and urine as I piss on their charred corpses! Muhahaha! Oh, what? We’re on? What do you mean we’re-? Oh. Uh… Ahem. Hey guys! Joker here. Another chapter to close the gap, and we see that you do not fuck around with people Yuki cares about. Of course, you can really only fuck around with Illuna and Shii at this point. Lefi would probably turn you into a smear on the ground, and Rir would use you as his new fire hydrant. Of course, those would probably be preferable to what they’d do to you should you choose to mess with Illuna or Shii, as is being shown now. It’s a shame he was a bit slow. Illuna already got out though. Wonder if they’re going to be able to meet up see. Guess we’ll find out. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Fugitive***The only conclusion I could possibly draw from my analysis was that humans were weak. Every single one of the men I had just slain was a veritable piece of human trash. They lived their lives as members of the underworld and actively engaged in the application of force. Yet, they remained completely useless in combat. Their stats were almost all in the one to two hundred range, which was a far cry from the six hundredish of everything that I had started with. Hell, their MP and magic stats are even worse than Illuna’s. And she’s literally a child. Like, holy shit. Now I see why the dungeon decided to just go ahead and make me a demon. Humans ain’t worth jack.“So? You seen her?” I spoke in a malevolent tone as I kicked aside the corpses in my way and walked towards the only man I had left alive. The chair was already occupied by the morbidly obese, sorry excuse for a human being, so I sat down on the desk in front of him instead. I had already described Illuna’s appearance to the man, but he didn’t quite seem as cooperative as I had hoped.“You won’t get away with this, you little shit! Don’t you know who I am!?”
“Sorry Porky, but as far as I can tell, you don’t look any different from the next pig. You’re all just livestock. If you want someone to be able to tell you apart, then you better call in a god damned farmer.”I casually retrieved a dagger off one of the nearby corpses and used it to nail the pig’s arm to his chair as I insulted him.“D-Do you really think you can get away with this!?” the pig stuttered. “The nobles aren’t going to keep their mouths sharrtjahgjkshdgkh!?”
“Stop that,” I glared at the pig as I drilled my foot into his face. “Stop spitting everywhere. It’s gross, and it’s making me really want to kill you.”I was unable to immediately slit the man’s throat because I had to ask him for Illuna’s whereabouts. I scoured the manor, but I was never able to find her, regardless of how many scumbags I cut down. I had used a skill to search for any enemies remaining in the area. The results it produced were what led me to the office.Likewise, Rir was also doing his best to find the little vampire. He too was wandering the manor, his nose as his guide.“I guess all that fat you’ve got is stopping my words from getting through to you. I’m not repeating myself again, so listen carefully, Porky.” I raised my blade and pressed it against the oversized pig’s neck. Oh wait, this is the perfect chance to do the thing.I had yet to test out my weapon’s ability to intoxify my foes. They’d all been far too weak for me to bother. But now, I had the perfect thing to test it on, and I saw no reason to discard the opportunity. A series of geometric patterns appeared on the blade as the magical circuits reacted to the mana I channeled through the weapon. The toxic liquid the blade secreted slowly dripped down its edge. Everything it touched would sizzle in the same way as something that had been exposed to sulfuric acid. Seeing the effect caused the man to twitch, almost like he’d been zapped by a sudden jolt of electricity.“And if you can’t answer me, then I’m probably gonna get real sad. Sad enough to accidentally let my blade slip.” I purposefully made my hand tremble a bit to burn the threat into his mind. “Now, dig into those memories of yours, Porky. I’m looking for a 7-8 year old vampire. She’s got blonde hair and is about as tall as you’d expect anyone her age to be.”
“I-I don’t know!!” Porky answered me right away, but the answer he so desperately shouted wasn’t the one I’d wanted to hear.
“The fuck you just say…?”
“I-I’m not lying! I really don’t know! No one knows! She just upped and vanished!”
“What…?”The pig realized that he grabbed my attention, so he immediately began babbling as fast as he possibly could. The words left his mouth so quickly that I almost found his actions entertaining. Long story short, Illuna had somehow managed to escape, all on her own. They knew that she was tenacious enough to escape into the Wicked Forest’s depths, so they’d given her a special set of magically enhanced shackles and even assigned a pair of guards to keep watch. In spite of all their efforts, Illuna had still managed to escape.She had already been sold, and delivering her was all they needed to complete the transaction. They began frantically searching the area for the girl’s whereabouts the moment she disappeared, only to be interrupted by the incoming draconic horde; we had cut their search short.And that was all the information they had. The only way I could learn anything else was by questioning the pair that was in charge of keeping an eye on her. But it was too late. Their heads were amongst the pile I’d created when I first barged into the office. Welp. There goes that lead. Guess this means I might’ve been a bit too trigger happy. Thinking about it led me to recall that Illuna had been on the run when I first found her. Smart as she was, the young vampire had judged that there was no point in remaining in her cage, so she broke out and escaped.I had no idea exactly how she managed it all, but I didn’t particularly care. All that mattered was the fact that she was okay.“I’m back, boss! And I’ve brought reinforcements!”Oh great. More scum. I rolled my eyes as I looked towards the man that had just entered the room.“Excellent work!” Porky cackled triumphantly before pointing at me with a huge grin on his face. “You’re a moron! Did you really think that I was scared of you. I was just buying time so… my rein…forcements… could…”He’d started off with an absurdly cocky tone, but soon began trailing off, eyes wide, for the man wasn’t the only thing to arrive. Rir had too. In fact, the wolf had casually knocked the newly arrived man aside by swatting him the same way he would have a mosquito. The man was unable to react to the sudden development; his head ended up smashing into the wall, spilling its contents all over.“Looks like she’s not here,” I said to the wolf.
“I-It’s not over yet! M-my reinforcements will—” Porky started prattling again, but I was sick of it.
“Your reinforcements? You mean the guys with their entrails splattered all over the hallway?” I directed Porky’s eyes towards the hallway. It seemed to be filled with a bunch of fresh corpses—ones I didn’t remember creating. Evidently, Rir had happened to squish a scumbag or two on his way over.“Damn it!” Porky grabbed a sword off a nearby corpse and swung it at me. Only now had he finally realized that waiting on his men was fruitless. “Take this, you bastard!”
“Oh come on, you seriously think that’s gonna hit? You need some serious exercise, Porky.” I avoided the attack with ease before retaliating by giving the pigman’s shoulder a light nick.The amount of damage the cut inflicted was tiny, but Porky Pig began writhing in pain and screeching in agony, for the blade’s poison had entered his system through the wound. The colour of his flesh changed as the toxins slowly began invading his body, eating him from the inside out. Sweating profusely, Porky extended an arm towards me in an attempt to beg for salvation.“Wow, Porky. You don’t look so good. It looks like I should probably excuse myself and let you get some much needed rest.” I gave the pig a casual sidelong glance as I excused myself and left the room.***Upon exiting the manor, Rir and I found ourselves surrounded. A group of humans had been waiting for me just outside the entrance, where they stood in a semi-circular formation. Every last man had their weapons drawn and pointed straight at us. Wow. Talk about being vigilant. All they’re up against is a dog and its owner. Only then did I finally understand why we hadn’t encountered any of the city’s guards inside the manor. Unlike the ruffians, the guards were trained. They knew not to recklessly charge in without first uncovering their foes’ identity. Their equipment was in good order, their movements were agile, and their decisions were rational. It was clear that they were true warriors, men who earned their keep through the practice of war. Ugh… What a pain in the ass.Though I could’ve dealt with the men, I decided not to. I flat out ignored them as I took a deep breath and shouted at the top of my lungs. “ILLUUUUUUNAAAAAAAA!!”
“Yuki! You came!”I had raised my voice because I had expected the young vampire to take refuge a bit further away. But, much to my surprise, she’d actually been nearby. Turning towards its source, I found myself face to face with an empty alleyway, in which she suddenly appeared. The effect looked like one based in magic; she’d basically popped out of a random building’s shadow.She pitter pattered towards me and leapt into my arms, so I gave her a tight squeeze and gently pat her over the head. “There you are! Good job getting out on your own! I’m really proud of you.”“Mhm! I did my very very best!” She buried her face into my chest as her eyes began to water. But then, as if suddenly recalling something, she jerked her face back upwards. Her expression was one of pain. It looked like she was about to burst into tears. “I’m not the only one they caught. There are lots of others. Please, please help them!”
“…” I looked at her for a moment before nodding. “Got it. I’ll make sure I do something about it, so how about you and Rir go on ahead?”
“Okay! Thanks so much! Me and Rir will wait ‘till you’re done!” Illuna smiled cheerfully as she nodded.
“No problem,” I said, before turning to the wolf. “Take Illuna and get out of town. I’ll be there soon.”Rir looked a bit worried for my safety, but he ended up acknowledging his orders with a nod. He placed Illuna on his back and kicked off the ground.“The wolf’s making an escape!” One of the guards pointed towards Rir and shouted.
“That’s fine! Just ignore it!” shouted the commander. His subordinates once again demonstrated how well trained they were by following his orders to the letter. They immediately redirected their attention and turned their weapons back towards me.But I wasn’t impressed. I didn’t have the liberty to be impressed.“Accursed humans…“ My mind was so clouded with crimson that I forgot my own former identity and loosed a feral roar.. “I’ll kill you! I’ll kill every single last one of you!”My magical energy mirrored my rage and overflowed from my body. It blew out all the windows in my vicinity. The air seemed to tremble in the same way it would if it had potent electrical currents coursing through it. As my mana leaked into my surroundings, the armed men began to collapse, one after another. They simply toppled over, unconscious.The pure anger within me had stemmed all from a single source.Illuna.Someone had hit her. Someone had left a visible bruise on her face. And that someone had been human.I saw no reason to allow a race that would brazenly beat young children to be allowed to continue existing without consequence or fear.I grinded my teeth against each other and gripped my greatsword with such force that its handle began warping out of shape.“Calm yourself, Yuki.” Something wrapped itself around my back right as my anger reached its peak. Its warmth comforted me and abated my rage, melting it away like snow in springtime.
“Lefi…” I spoke the name of the girl that had embraced me. She was standing on her tiptoes so she could rest her chin on my shoulders and whisper straight into my ears. Her ever familiar scent was, for reasons I failed to understand, soothing.
“Calm yourself,” she repeated. “You have already achieved your goal. You have retrieved Illuna and rewarded those that have hurt her with their well deserved retribution. You’ve not any more business here. It is time to return.”
“…”
“More importantly, I am rather famished. The work I have done today was significant. I take that you will provide me a meal befitting my efforts?” She spoke cheerfully as she flashed me a grin.
“Yeah, I guess it’s only fair.” I too couldn’t help but smile as I responded to her, albeit wryly. “I’ll go all out and feed you the best sweet I’ve got.”
“The best you have, you say!? That does sound rather appealing.” she said. “I trust that it will live up to my expectations?”
“Heh.” I smirked. “Don’t be silly. It’ll be so good it’ll totally blow your taste buds away and desensitize you to sweetness for days.”
“D-Days? Perhaps I may do best to proceed its consumption with caution…”The way Lefi had spoken to me was no different from usual, so I too had reciprocated in kind. And before long, I found myself restored to my usual state of mind.I had finally managed to calm down.“I-I apologize for interrupting, but… are you a demon?” The sole conscious human approached us and timidly addressed us. Unlike the others, he had only fallen to his knees.
“What do you want, old man?”
“I-I am Raylow Lurubia, this city’s governor. Am I correct in assuming that you’ve only visited our humble town because you wished to pick up a relative?”
“Pretty much. Some asshole kidnapped my little sister, so we came to pick her up.”
“I-I’m terribly sorry,” stuttered the man. “I would like to extend you an invitation to my manor as an apology.”The hell? I’m pretty sure he knows that I’m a demon, and that demons and humans don’t exactly get along. Why the hell would he invite us over? Only after a moment’s contemplating did I realize that man was nervously shooting glances in Lefi’s direction. Wait, is he analyzing her?Double checking the man’s stats confirmed that, surely enough, he had the Analyze skill. In other words, he knew that Lefi was the Supreme Dragon. Well, turns out that Lefi wasn’t bullshitting about being a thing of legends after all. Yeah, I can kinda see how you’d start acting all subservient and shit with a literal legendary beast around. “What say you, Yuki?” The dragon girl turned towards me. “I’ve not a preference towards either possibility.”
“I’ll accept,” I said. “There’s still one more unfinished item we’ve gotta check off before we leave.”I had yet to fulfill Illuna’s request.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Nice, Yuki finally managed to meet up with Illuna. Saw her bruise and now he’s going to go to town. Or so I thought… Oh well. At least Porky and his ilk got what they deserved, even if I wish Yuki stayed to watch him die. Bah, I can imagine it well enough, so it’s all good in the end. Yes, good. Drown on your own blood. Muhahaha. Next time, I hope we get to see him stick it to the governor about why the hell they sent people after Illuna, and to warn them exactly what will happen if they try and take her again. Also, I wanna try something. If you’ve got a question for me, leave it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it in the next chapter’s editors notes.. Yeah, I know. Creative and all that. But it’s just something I wanna try out. If no one likes it, I’ll stop. *shrug* Just curious to see what kind of turn out I get. Who knows, it might blow up in my face, we get over 100 comments on the chapter, and boss’ll ask me what the hell I was thinking. At least then, senpai would notice me…. Uh, anyway, that’s all for now. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Conclusion – Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“I cannot apologize enough for everything that’s happened.” The governor spoke as he showed us to his reception room and sat down across from us.The sofas we were situated on, like the rest of the governor’s mansion, appeared to be more modest than gaudy. Of course, that wasn’t to say that the governor was a poor interior decorator. In fact, I very much preferred his manor to the overly flashy, poorly decorated base that I had just finished raiding. It just feels more refined this way.“I’m sure that the trouble we’ve caused you has frustrated you to no end. And for that, I must apologize. Please, find it in your hearts to forgive us,” he continued. His voice was laced with exhaustion.His subordinates had kept popping up and pointing their weapons at us throughout our trip to his manor. The old man had no choice but to spend a few moments ordering them to stand down each and every single time. The sheer number of repetitions had been so great that I had begun to empathize with him. Like, god damn. Sure sucks to be him right now. And the worst part is that I can’t say I don’t know how it feels. Eugh…“Human, Raylow, I take it you are aware of my identity?” Lefi took the initiative in replying to the man as she cast her gaze upon him. The lazy tone of voice she normally spoke with was nowhere to be seen. Her words were so cold that they almost seemed to be coated with a layer of ice.
“O-Of course,” stuttered the governor. He tried his best to cover up his nervousness, but he was unable. It leaked through nonetheless. “I am fully aware of your identity and the majesty it entails.”
“Then I suppose you know of the pact I share with your ancestors? I see not why knowledge of it would be kept from one who governs over others.”
“A pact? What?” I raised an eyebrow as Lefi mentioned a term I hadn’t expected to hear.
“Only now have I recalled that I’ve yet to inform you of it,” said Lefi. “There was once an age filled with strife, an entire era in which every last fool sought strength and glory. I was challenged by many a warrior. Their vain attempts were but obnoxious; I appreciated them not. Annoyed as I was, I sought to eliminate the problem at its source. I began to attack the human nations from which they stemmed. My efforts were met with panic. The human kings of the past appealed against their destruction and offered a pact of non-interference. That is the pact of which I speak.”I… see… So you basically put so much pressure on them that they had no choice but to get things done through diplomacies that worked to your benefit? Yeah, makes sense to me.“The young maiden this incident revolves around is one I see as my kin. I was informed that your kind would meddle in my affairs no longer. And yet, you kidnapped one of my brood. The pact that you desired was broken by one of your own. I trust that you understand that your sins require compensation.”
“I-I’m terribly sorry, but there was no way we could have possibly known, let alone prevented it! The individuals responsible were outlaws!”
“I care not for your circumstances. The fact remains that our agreement has been violated.”
“I suppose so…” The individual before the governor looked like a mere girl in her early teens. And yet, he was pale with terror. His expression had frozen up and he was literally sweating buckets. Man, watching this shit go down is almost making me feel bad for him.
“And though I have voiced a need for compensation, I must admit that there is little that I desire. However, the same cannot be said for my companion. I trust that you will answer his demands to the best of your ability.” Lefi flashed me a sidelong glance as she spoke.Wait. Was that whole threat just a facade? ‘Cause it looks to me like she was just doing it to make my life a helluva lot easier.“You sure seem a lot more competent than usual today,” I said. “You doing okay?”
“Much to my displeasure, you have continued to label me as one who is useless and lazy despite my majesty. I am merely demonstrating to you that I am deserving of my title,” she said. “And Yuki, I suggest that you forget not the situation given that you have yet to complete your final goal.”
“Oh yeah… Right…”The Supreme Dragon turned back towards the governor, who was completely and utterly dumbfounded by our silly exchange, and coughed to clear her throat before continuing. “It is he that shall inform you of his demands.”
“Uhhh… yeah, sure.” Lefi had totally put me on the spot, so I took a moment to adjust and took a deep breath before speaking to the governor.“First thing’s first, stay out of our business if you don’t want to die.” I said threateningly. “You can think of me the same way you do Lefi. Don’t mess with me. I don’t care what excuses you have. If anything like this ever happens again, I’ll tear your fucking throat out.”
“I-I understand,” said the governor. “I will do my best to ensure that we never trespass on the Wicked Forest again.”The Wicked Forest? I’mma go ahead and guess that’s what they call the forest we live in. Never knew it had such a sinister sounding name.“The second thing I want to say has to do with slavery. I saw a bunch of girls in the mansion I attacked. Hand them over. And send all the rest of this city’s slaves over while you’re at it.” I glanced at Lefi as I spoke. It was a signal. I was telling her to get the dragons up above to act if the governor wasn’t keen on the idea. This whole scenario is making me feel like a sly old fox. I’m basically just mooching off Lefi’s influence and stringing the poor governor along. Maybe I should start adding fox puns to everything I say.
“Is that all you desire?” asked the governor.
Wait. What? The fuck? Why’s he so cooperative? Isn’t this supposed to be where he starts getting all pissy and reluctant?“You realize that I’m demanding every last individual within this city’s bounds, right?”
“I am aware. I will have them arranged for you as soon as possible,” replied the governor. “Will you require transportation? I can prepare several carriages for you should you need them.”
“Uhh….” I turned towards the dragon in the room. “Hey Lefi, you think the dragons could carry them?”
“It will be a simple task so long as the number of individuals in question does not surpass three hundred.”
“We’re good on the carriages,” I said, turning back towards the governor. I highly doubt there’ll be over three hundred. At least, I hope not. That’d be a whole shitload of trouble.
“I understand. I will have them brought to you immediately. I would appreciate it if you would wait here while I get everything in order.” The governor left the room immediately after hearing my request and began shouting for one of his subordinates. “Alto!”And thus ended my assault on the city. It was my first time raiding a town in another world, but the note it had ended on had turned out to be fairly anticlimactic.***“And there they go…” I, Raylow Lurubia, sank into my chair and heaved a sigh of relief as I watched the draconic brood fly off into the distance. If I ever had to sum up the night’s experience in just a single word, I would label it terrifying.I had suspected that the Supreme Dragon may be involved the moment I heard that we were dealing with not one, but a whole group of dragons. Lo and behold, my hypothesis had hit the mark. The legendary dragon’s appearance had thrown me off. Never in my wildest dreams had I ever suspected that she would bear the form of a beautiful maiden. But I knew that she was genuine. Her power was far too immense to belong to any other.In the past, I had been a mere wanderer. I would never have become a governor had it not been for the many times I distinguished myself in battle. Alfyro was far from the capital. It was even fair to say that it was a part of the borderlands. But even so, I never would have risen to power had my accomplishments not been exceptional. My prowess in battle had always been predicated on my capacity to discern the power level of any I was pitted against. It was an ability I had naturally picked up while wandering the land.I could tell at a glance that I was no match for the Supreme Dragon. She was so much more powerful than me that I was unable to discern anything beyond her identity. The fear that her gaze had left in me was greater than any I had ever experienced on the battlefield. I likely would have passed out had I lost focus, even for a moment.And yet, terrifying as she was, she hadn’t come alone. He had joined her.His jet black hair was so ominous that it almost appeared to embody darkness itself. One of his eyes shared the same terrifying colour, while the other looked to be dyed in blood. Of all his features, his eyes had been the most memorable. They contained a sharp glint, one that had vividly burned itself into my memories. And although he was not as fearsome as the Supreme Dragon herself, he too had struck fear in my heart.“He seemed to be a demon lord… He and his dungeon were likely recently born in the Wicked Forest.”Recalling the man caused me to shiver in my boots. A part of it stemmed from the attitude with which he treated the Supreme Dragon. That alone was a cause for terror, but there was far more to it than just that. The wolf he had in his service was a Fenrir, another creature of which legends were sung. He would have been able to raze the city, even without the Supreme Dragon’s help. There was no doubt that he would have obliterated my men and I had he attacked us. But fortunately, both he and the dragon were reasonable. It was possible for me to fight them not with blades, but with words. I was glad that it had come down to a negotiation.“Accursed pig…” I swore as I recalled the face of the man that had caused this incident to occur. “You’ve caused me a great deal of trouble.”The sole benefit that the raid had provided was ridding my city of the pig and his gang. They had been wiped out, completely and utterly eliminated. In life, the pig had been a massive, three hundred pound thorn in my side. He gathered slaves through bandit-like methodologies and sold them for prices that could only be labeled obscene. His hands were stained with all sorts of illegal activity. His organisation had practically been a criminal syndicate.And yet, I had been unable to purge him. There was no use in exposing his crimes. He had too many deep rooted connections with the nobility. Many a dirty noble would have done everything in their power to protect him to prevent their deals with him from coming to light. I had no choice but to sit by and watch as he committed one atrocity after another.Destruction of the pig aside, there was no harm done. I was almost tempted to dub the demon lord’s actions more beneficial than harmful. But I knew that was far from true.The problem lay not with the past, but rather, the future.A storm was brewing. The Supreme Dragon’s power is not nearly as feared as it once was. Greed drove many a man to believe that invading the Wicked Forest and claiming its abundant resources was wise. And there was no doubt that those who support this movement would use the incident that had just occurred as an opportunity to dispatch the nation’s forces and “seek retribution.”And in my heart, I knew that the action was no different from leaping into one’s own grave. They were sure to act if provoked.I had to prevent any and all invasions of their territory no matter what the cost, especially since the Supreme Dragon was no longer the only threat. A demon lord had risen.***Joker’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another chapter fills the gap, and we see that Yuki and the governor managed to come to an agreement. Good on them both. I’m sure that this will lead to a very beneficial relationship in the future. Probably more so for Yuki than the governor. Poor guy is probably going to be driven into an early grave with the stress Yuki will give him. Hang in there, old chap. You can get through it. All right. Time to get to the inaugural #AskJoker answers.rfctksSparkle asks: “why are ye a joker?”
Well, the answer is quite simple. My name comes from my Discord handle, PhantomThiefJoker. From Persona 5. Quite possibly my favorite JRPG. At least until KH3 comes out. Maybe.Zekkendo asks: “Who’s your favorite character in the story so far? And does it change in future chapters?”
A fair question. I’d have to say as of right now, I’m quite liking Yuki. He’s got a no nonsense attitude that most other isekai protags seem to lack. I know there are some out there, Shield Hero and Arifureta off the top of my head. But it’s still refreshing to see someone willing to use their powers to get what they want, rather than think “Oh, if I show these people my awesome power, they won’t leave me alone or they’ll hate me.” Geez, get over it.And last but not least, Anon asks: “Is your role basically proofreading what the translator provides before it is published?”
The short answer is, yes. Boss Young’un does the translations, the rewrites, and the re-rewrites before sending it to Sebas, Phoenix, and myself. We then comb over it, make corrections and suggestions, then let the boss know we’re done so that he can go through, approve or deny our suggestions, then get the chapter out to y’all hungry fans. But the long answer is, I do much more. I fetch his coffee, I keep his office clean, I go out and buy the raws, I… wait… what kind of working environment is this? HR?! We need to have a talk! *storms away*And that’s all for now. 3 questions for the first run, not too bad. Nothing too out there or NSFW either, which is good. If you’ve got questions, leave ‘em in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker, and I’ll get to them when boss sends me the next chapter, which I’ll see y’all in!Sebas Tian’s note: Glad to see more of the gap filled up as we replace Wuji’s garbage with a presentable and not butchered to hell chapter. As for Joker’s bit about HR, we don’t have one of those so his complaints will probably fall on deaf ears, but cardboard is a pretty reasonable sort so I’m sure he’ll listen if he’s not distracted by video games. Speaking of video games, much like Joker I’m also looking forward to kingdom hearts 3.I enjoyed the governor’s thoughts at the end there, it helps add perspective to how Yuki’s actions actually affect the outside world and is fun to see the common sense reaction to him since he lacks almost all of this world’s common sense himself. Lefi was kinda adorable with how she was acting like she’s trying to show off some and make sure Yuki knows there’s more to her than he knows. What I’m probably most curious about is how many slaves there are and what Yuki actually plans to do with them all cause I can see him doing the whole, bringing those who ask back to their homes via dragon airlines and letting those who have no home to return to, stay in the dungeon.<– Prev — Next –>

Returning Home
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Sooooo…. what now?” I looked over the girls we had retrieved from the city as I stood by the dungeon’s entrance. I had been a bit worried that it would be subject to an attack while we were away, so I had blocked the entrance with a large boulder. But as we were back, said boulder had instead been returned to my inventory.All of the twenty odd slaves were huddled together, trembling with fear as they rested their eyes on me. They hadn’t been told anything; none of them knew why they’d suddenly been brought into the Wicked Forest’s depths. Of course, Illuna wasn’t amongst them. Her day had been a long one, and the whole kidnapping ordeal had left her thoroughly exhausted, so I shipped her off to bed the moment she got home. Likewise, Shii was also fast asleep. The slime had been so excited by the vampire’s return that it had leapt about until it passed out. In other words, the dungeon’s two noncombatants had set off together on a journey in the land of dreams.“I presume you failed to consider the consequences of your actions?”
“Yeah, pretty much,” I answered. “I kinda sorta totally forgot.”
“…I am not surprised,” muttered Lefi. “While you appear as if you think deeply about your actions, I know that, in truth, you merely choose whichever happens to be on your mind at that moment.”You understand me well, Lefi. The sides of my lips curved upwards ever so slightly.“Oh yeah!” I turned back towards the crowd as I suddenly came up with an idea. “I know you guys all got captured and enslaved and whatnot. But you did have homes before that happened, right?”Though, for the most part, they still seemed to be trembling in fear, excitement began spreading through their ranks. They began whispering to each other and discussing the implications of my words. One of the group’s members eventually ended up timidly stepping forward on their behalf. She had horns like a sheep and carried herself in a manner I could only describe as cool and composed.“W-we do, oh venerable demon lord. Most of us were kidnapped whilst working away from our hometowns. But even those that weren’t have places they can return to,” she said with a tremble. The sheep girl was much calmer than all the other girls present, but nervous nonetheless.
“Woah. Colour me impressed. How’d you figure out what I am?”
“The properties carried by your mana are what allowed me to discern it.”Huh. So mana really does work like that. I figured as much, but still, sure is nice to have someone confirm it.“Alright, all of you having homes makes this whole situation much easier to deal with,” I said.
“Hey Lefi, can you have the dragons take them back to their families?”
“A simple task.”The Supreme Dragon looked to the sky and made a gesture with her index finger. Her underlings, who had been flying way up high, descended to a much lower height and lined themselves up next to one another without a moment’s delay. The obedience sure is convenient and all that, but just what the hell did she do to them? Like, seriously… Look at how disciplined they are…“A single glance at your expression is enough to convey to me that of which you wish to ask,” said Lefi as she turned towards me. “The answer is rather simple, Yuki. I merely engraved my supremacy into the very depths of their beings. Even their bones understand that it is none other than I who they must obey.”Hot dayum. Daz cray cray.“A-Anyways,” I cleared my throat and continued to speak to the slaves. “Just tell these dragons where your homes are, and they’ll have you dropped off in a jiffy. They’re pretty smart, so they should get you there without any issues so long as you give ‘em directions.”Most of the girls had obviously been dead on the inside. Their eyes were like empty voids, and peering into them called for naught but the abyss. However, hearing my words had caused hope to fill them once more. They grew more vibrant and excited as they realized that they would once again be allowed to return to the homes that they thought they would never see again.It seemed that the reason the only slaves that remained were young women was not because the traders had chosen to slay or ignore all the males. Rather, it was because the country the city we raided was affiliated with was currently in the midst of a war. Demons and demihumans were known to be stronger than humans, so all the enslaved men had been dragged off to the battlefield, regardless of age. Likewise, the older women had been provided the exact same treatment.That was one of the two reasons that there were only about twenty of them in spite of the city’s size. The other had to do with legality. The country had outlawed all transactions involving slaves. Both purchasing them and selling them was prohibited; all slaves on the market were the products of illegal activity. And thus, slave traders were few in number. The only organisations that dabbled in the exchange were those that were a part of the criminal underworld to begin with, like the one that I had crushed during my stay.Our good friend the governor had absolutely no idea how he was supposed to handle the slaves himself, so he had eagerly jumped on the opportunity we presented him and pushed them onto us instead. Thinking about it that way makes me feel a whole mixed bag of emotions… but oh well, whatever. I’ll just consider the whole scenario a part of Illuna’s request. She almost never asks for anything, so I should probably give it my all.“A-Are you truly willing to send us home?” the sheep girl asked, wide eyed.
“Yeah, I don’t particularly mind. One of ours got kidnapped too, so I might as well help out everyone that happens to be in the same boat as her,” I said. “Oh and make sure you speak up if you don’t have anywhere to go. We can figure something out. I was the one who brought you guys all the way out here, so I’m obviously not going to be doing something as ridiculous as kicking you out and ditching you in the middle of the forest just ‘cause you don’t got anywhere to go.”We could afford to take care of a few of them. Might be in a bit of trouble if too many of them stay behind though.The girls began chatting amongst themselves again, this time, a bit more noisily. A minute or two later, they came to an abrupt stop. They arranged themselves in as orderly a manner as they could before initiating a deep, simultaneous bow and speaking in sync.“We’re all different. We’re different races, and we come from different backgrounds. But we shared the same circumstances. That’s why we all want to offer you our gratitude. Thank you. Thank you for all the compassion you’ve shown us.”***“Okay, that’s another group gone. Looks like you two are the only ones left.” I turned towards the last two girls after watching another batch of dragons fly off.
“I was raised with the belief that I should always pay back any debts I accrue in full,” said the first of the two. “I would be glad to be in your service, but only if you don’t mind, of course.”She was the cool and collected sheep girl that had stepped out of the crowd to speak up for her peers. Sheep-like horns aside, the first thing I noticed about her was the dazzling white hair she had. It extended all the way down to her waist. Following it led me to realize that she had excellent proportions. All the parts of her body that needed to bulge did exactly that; all her curves were exactly where they needed to be. Her body’s lines were only further emphasized by the rags she wore. They were far too small for her, and they basically showcased a certain part of her body. I had no idea where to look. Fortunately, she herself wasn’t making much of a big deal of it and instead continued to carry herself with an air of nonchalance. How do I put this… she just seems… more mature than me. She’s got that older sister type vibe to her, if you know what I mean.“Uhm… Is that a Fenrir over there…?” The other girl was a beastkin. She had ears and a tail, both of which resembled that of a dog. Her hair was short, curly, and had about the same colour as a chestnut. Unlike the sheep girl, she didn’t appear nearly as seductive. I know this is hella rude to say, but she, Lefi, and Illuna have pretty much all got the exact same proportions.Still, she was ridiculously pretty. Both of them were. A single glance at either of the girls was enough for me to understand why they had been targeted.“Yeah, what about it?”
“I-I knew it!” She yelled ecstatically. “Can I please stay!? I’ll do whatever y’want! Please!?”
“U-Uhh… sure… I guess…” I blinked a few times, taken aback by her sudden vigour. “Is this because of Rir?”I pat the wolf’s fluff to indicate to her that I was talking about him.“To us warwolves, Fenrirs are basically gods! Man, I’m so happy! Leavin’ the village was worth it! Everyone told me it was a bad idea, but now I get to tell them that I got the chance t’serve a Fenrir!”
“Uh huh… Good for you…” I did my best to nod along as I recoiled from the wolf girl. Welp. Looks like we’ve got another strong personality on our hands.
“You hear that, Rir?” I gave the wolf another pat. “She says you’re basically a god.”Rir replied by whining and smiling as wryly as a wolf could. Yeahhhhh, I getchu bro. I’d also be pretty freaked out if some random chick started worshipping me.“Okay… oh wait, right, introductions. I’m Yuki, that’s Lefi, and this is Fluffrir,” I said as I pointed to each of us in turn. “We’ve got a few more, but they’re already fast asleep so I’ll introduce you guys tomorrow. What were your names again?”
“My name is Leila,” said the sheep girl. “Please issue me whatever orders you see fit.”Leila bowed as she spoke. No more bowing please. I’m starting to catch more than just a few glimpses of something I really shouldn’t be staring at.“I’m Lyuuinne Gyroll, a warwolf. I’d be real glad if you called me Lyuu for short,” said the dog girl. She seemed to be the kind of chick you’d leave in charge of looking after a boys’ softball team. She kinda reminds me of H*mura from P*wer Pr*s. Not because of how she looks or anything. It’s more like just the way she carries herself and whatnot.“Anyway,” I said. “I’m sure you’re both tired, so we can leave figuring out all the more complicated stuff for later. For now, you might as well just make yourselves at home,” I said, as I turned towards the dungeon’s entrance.
“Uhm, My Lord…” The sheep girl hesitated for a moment before voicing her thoughts. “This is just a cave, isn’t it?”
“I know what you’re trying to say, but don’t worry. I’m not about to make you sleep on top of a rock or anything. You’ll see. Just follow me.”I gave the two a quick sidelong glance as I entered the cave. They seemed a bit scared, but timidly followed me nonetheless. And so, with that confirmed, I turned my eyes to Lefi, who had taken up the rear. The look on her face and the air about her both made it obvious that she was proud of herself and her accomplishments.“Sooo… uh… Lefi…”
“Yes? What is it?” She looked right at me as she answered.
“…” I awkwardly paused for a bit before I continued. “Thanks for today. I couldn’t have pulled it off without you.”For a moment, she had let her emotions show. She stared at me in blank surprise, completely taken aback by the sudden expression of gratitude. But soon, she twisted it into a shiteating grin.“Are you perhaps referring to the moment in which I embraced you and calmed your nerves as I would an infant?”
“…C-Can we pretend that never happened? Like, seriously. Please?” I groaned in displeasure. She’d started to tease me right where it hurt.Seeing my reaction caused her to break into a hearty laugh. It lasted a good bit, but ultimately came to an abrupt halt.“Yuki, I…” She shifted to a completely different tone. One that was much more sincere. “I have spent many a year in solitude. I have been by my lonesome for as long as my memories serve. The world itself had grown dull and bland. Boredom was my sole emotion. And I had accepted it as the norm.”
“…”I wasn’t able to bring myself to answer her. The words she spoke reflected the loneliness brought about by her overwhelming power. They described the memories that she had made during the time she had spent as the Supreme Dragon.“That, however, no longer holds true. My days began to change soon after a certain fateful encounter. On that day, I met an individual who dyed my world in iridescence. He filled it with all sorts of colours and shades, the likes of which I had never imagined. So fresh and pleasant were the experiences he brought that I could not help but hold them dear to my heart.” She looked right at me as she spoke. “And that is the reason for which I would like to request, Yuki, that you continue to bring colour to my world.”She began to laugh as she finished speaking, almost as if to brush the confession off as a joke.But I knew.And that was why the short and simple reply I offered her was accompanied by a heavy nod.“Always.”***Joker’s Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. The gap closes even more. We’re almost caught up here, so I’m sure the site’s reader count will shoot up once we have everything filled in. Can’t wait. To all the new people, welcome. To the old hats, welcome back. Looks like we’re adding two more to the hare- I mean, staff of the dungeon. Lyuu reminds me of a tomboy, and Leila the studious type. At least, from what I’ve read of them so far. Only time will tell if I’m right or wrong. (Or, you know, the chapters we have of them up already) But enough about my thoughts on the chapter. Let’s get to what everyone’s excited for. Part two of #AskJoker, where I answer any questions you might have. Not a lot this time, only one.Elvenneet asks: Have you ever read Akuyaku Tensei Dakedo Doushite Kou Natta(Eliza for short)?I’d have to say no, I haven’t. Hit me up on Discord, if you’re part of the community, and lemme know what it’s about. I’m PhantomThiefJoker on there.That’s all for this time. Like I said, only one this time.

A Day With the Dungeon’s New Residents
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“What the heck, Yuki!?” Illuna crossed her arms and puffed out her cheeks in a cute display of anger and dissatisfaction. “Why are they here!?”
“W-Well, they said they wanted to stay. I was kind of the one that brought them all the way out here, so it’s not like I can turn them down, you know?” I, on the other hand, was stuck sitting on my own knees. The pose I took was a traditional Japanese pose of self reflection, the so called seiza. Of course, I hadn’t taken it of my own will. Rather, it was exactly the opposite. Illuna knew the purpose of the pose given the number of times that I had forced our resident dragon into it, and thus, she had demanded for me to take it as I justified the decisions I made in her absence.
“I’m very happy you came to save me,” she pouted. “But I don’t remember telling you that it was okay for you to take mistresses!”
“Uhm, s-sorry…? I guess?”Wait… why’s she mad at me again? Both new hires remained silent as they gazed upon the scene. It was evident from the looks in their eyes and the expressions on their faces that the interaction between the young vampire and I had warmed their hearts. Come on! Can’t one of you at least try to explain the situation to her!? God damn it!“Geez!” she complained. “I never knew you were such a cheater! Lefi’s okay, but…That’s it!”
“Now you hol’up real quick lil’ miss Illuna, ‘cause me thinks you be havin’ some serious misunderstandings,” I said, with a funny accent.
“No I’m not! Lefi taught me all about maids and what they’re for! They exist to make men cheat!” The little girl pointed to the dungeon’s newest residents, two newly appointed maids, in turn as she spoke. That was the title we had ended up giving them after taking their responsibilities into consideration.
“So, Professor Lefi, mind explaining why you’re corrupting this young child’s mind?”
“What? I have done no such thing. I merely described to her the extent of a maid’s duties,” claimed the Supreme Dragon.…And now I see the problem. Lefi actually thinks sex is part of the job description.“Not at all,” I denied. “That’s all just prejudice on your part. Sure, that kinda stuff does happen from time to time, but you really shouldn’t be lumping maids in with sex workers.”
“I-It’s okay Master!” Lyuuin, the dog girl, began to nervously swing her hips from left to right as her face flushed a shade of crimson. “I-I don’t think I’ll be any good at it ‘cause my body’s a bit lackin’ as far as proportions go, but I’ll gladly offer myself to you so long as y’keep lettin’ me serve Lord Fluffrir!”
“What the actual fuck!? I could swear that I literally just said I didn’t intend on making you do stuff like that!”The other maid, Leila, watched over the entire event with an entertained smile.“Oh boy…” I couldn’t help but heave a heavy sigh as I once again attempted to solve the misunderstanding that the dog eared maid had only deepened.***It had taken a while, but I eventually managed to calm Illuna down and teach her that maids and concubines were not the same thing. And so, with that out of the way, I finally began briefing our two newest residents about their new home and the duties they would attend. It was imperative that they understood what it meant to be employed by the dungeon as a corporation.“Anyway, to reiterate, I’d like you guys to be the dungeon’s maids. I’ve been stuck doing all the chores so far, and it’s sucked, so I’m hoping you guys will be able to ease my load a bit.” I began by elaborating on the corporate structure (1 demon lord, 1 supreme dragon, 1 little girl, and 2 pets) before moving onto duties (killing monsters, growing the dungeon, lazing around, and playing house with the resident little girl).That said, the first and second duties had already fallen onto the backburner. There wasn’t much of a point in actively hunting for monsters unless I really wanted something off the catalogue. Likewise, the dungeon’s territory didn’t require all that much management either. It was growing at a fairly steady rate over time due to all my passive income.Moreover, I had lately acquired a much greater means of killing time in the form of board games. Lefi and Illuna had only recently memorized most games’ rules, so we’d been spending a good bit of time playing through them. Alright newbies, you better learn those rules ASAP. ‘Cause you know, the more the merrier and all that.As they’d officially become the dungeon’s residents, neither of the two girls were wearing the same rags they’d come in with any longer. I’d given them a set of maid uniforms, and not the kind you’d find in the part of Tokyo where people who loved the two dimensional roamed the streets. Rather than short and skimpy as possible, their uniforms were prim and proper. They were classy, formal, and of course, items I had procured through the dungeon’s catalogue. God damn, catalogue bro, you are one helluva sinful man. Being able to make stuff like this definitely marks you a degenerate beyond redemption.“I think that covers everything.”
“I believe you may have missed something,” said Leila, as she tilted her head in confusion. “You didn’t mention anything about our nightly duties. What will we have to d—”
“Nothing.” I cut her off before she was able to finish. Please stop. We kinda have young children present here, you know? And besides, I’m a man. And like any other man, I’m going to find it really hard to resist my urges if you keep tempting me. Especially with that super hot bod of yours. Like hot damn. Dem tits. Dat ass.“Anyways.” I faked a cough. “You guys are pretty much bound to run into all sorts of things you’ve never seen before lying around here and there. Please ask around if you don’t know how something works. Your room will be the one you used last night. And, that should be about it. Any questions?”The room I mentioned was one I added the night before. Illuna, Lefi, and I had always just slept in the throne room with our beds lined up right next to each other’s. I suspected that it would feel a bit cramped if we added the maids to the mix, so I decided to make them a room. Of course, I extended the same offer to the other girls, but neither had really wanted one, so I hadn’t bothered. At least for the time being.I had been planning to do some heavy renovations soon anyway, so I decided that I might as well put off making their rooms until I started with those. Plus, I’ve kinda been wanting a room myself. There are many reasons a young man might want his own room, not all of which need to be said.“What’s this, Master?” The wolf girl curiously picked up a nearby object.
“A thin black thing will come out if you press the clicky part at the top. You can use that to write.”
“Wow! This magic item of yours sure does seem handy!”Ah, yes. The mighty magically enchanted item from Earth we call a mechanical pencil.“And what would this be, My Lord?” Like Lyuuin, Leila also regarded a nearby prop with her gaze full of curiosity.
“That’s just a toy. It’s one Lefi likes a lot, so I’m sure she’ll be willing to teach you all about it once she’s up.”I glanced at the Supreme Dragon, only to once again confirm that she was passed out in bed. She had been awake earlier in the morning, but went right back to sleep the moment she finished her meal. Well… I mean I guess she did work a lot harder than usual last night, so I guess I may as well turn a blind eye to that excessive laziness of hers. For now.“Oh yeah,” I turned to Leila, the sheep horned girl, as I suddenly thought up a question I thought she might be able to answer. “Just what are demon lords to demons anyway?”
“Humans have referred to our leaders as demon lords, but that isn’t quite right. We demons consider demon lords as creatures that lord over and have had their bodies forged anew by labyrinths.”Labyrinths? I guess that must be what she calls dungeons.“What do you mean by ‘forged anew?’”
“Becoming a demon lord is like being reborn, in a sense. The best way to explain this would be to use an example,” she explained. “If a goblin were to become a labyrinth’s ruler, then it would come to possess abilities outside the realm of what the goblin race is capable of. Thus, the demon lord can no longer be classified as a goblin. It would be much more correct to label it a whole new race, one created with a goblin as its base.”Oh, I get it. So I guess that makes me a demon lord with its powers funneled into the body of an archdemon. I’m pretty sure it’d be fair to say that the demon lord part of me is where most of my abilities come from.“You sure are well informed, Leila. I might be asking you more stuff like this in the future,” I said. I don’t actually know all that much about this world. My impressions pretty much all stem from my own preconceived biases, so I doubt they’ll prove very accurate.
“N-Not at all,” replied Leila. “I-I’m glad I was able to help.”
“Hmm…?” For some odd reason, she seemed kind of flustered, or maybe even panicked. “Anyway, let’s do our best to get along. Make sure you let me know if you need anything.”And so, two new employees were added to the dungeon’s corporate roster.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Closing the gap, only two left. Who’s excited? I know I am. Plus, the fact that this chapter came out is proof that Boss Young’un didn’t get his finger infected so yay. Celebrations all around. CHEESE FOR EVERYBODY! Wait, strike that. Cheese for no one. Which can be just as much a celebration if ya don’t like cheese, aye? Also, how dare Lefi try to educate Illuna on “that”. She’s just a child, you diabetes-heading, lazy excuse for a dragon. Proper child rearing is important. Impotent. No, no, important. You were right the first time, brain. Heh, believe in yourself. Uh, anyway, onto the questionsTeru asks: uhh.. do you know how many tentacles ST have? O.O
Infinite tentacles, so that he can have his way with all women around the world at once. Pray that he does not find the Book of Secrets, else no women who have ever existed, in this world or the next, in this realm, or even the realm of fiction, will be safe from him.ST says: Tentacle is singular.Aurelious asks: a bit random but relevant to the genre
What do you think about Isekai in general since from time to time I see a lot of people always whining about if a series ends up being an isekai and add a harem, it’s already trash to them. I’m already used to seeing them but to other people, I know some people got demotivated from starting an actual good series when we talked about it.Honestly, I enjoy Isekai novels. They’re probably my favorite. I’m easy to please. Give me an OP character, cute characters he cares about, and have a nice time in the world, and I’m happy. Probably why Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody is my favorite light novel right now. I’m caught up on both the LN (official translation, so volume 7) and WN right now. Plus, I’ll be getting the Blu-ray version when it comes out in March.zekkendo asks: Last time I asked about your favorite character, and you said Yuki. If you could choose one, which of his powers would you have? Personally, I’m torn between Weapon Transmutation and Flight.Bruh, give me his dungeon catalogue and the ability to get DP and I’d be set. Don’t think small, think big! With the dungeon catalogue and the ability to get DP, you could get all of those and more!Last but not least, Anon asks: Does JM (perhaps raws) show signs of nearing completion? (Presuming it’s not already completed)That, I actually have no idea on, so I’ll have to turn it over to the boss. Take it away boss.
ST: (Sorry, I’m not caught up with the raws. Reading that far ahead will kill my motivation to translate. Based on the author’s release rate, however, it looks like it’s still going strong.)And there we go. Another resounding round of #AskJoker. Remember, if you have any questions you’d like me to answer, serious or random, put ‘em in the comments down below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer them next time.

Renovating The Dungeon
Editor: JokerToday, I’ll finally start renovating the dungeon. I thought to myself as I looked around the throne room. The only invader that’s gotten anywhere close to the throne room is that one three headed dog I killed the day I summoned Shii, but I’ve been putting it off for far too long. It’s about time I stop procrastinating and get to work. My goal was to modify the dungeon such that it actually looked, well, like a dungeon. That said, I had no intention of crafting, for any potential invaders, an experience what would be seen in a typical JRPG. That is, I wasn’t going to just make a cave with a whole bunch of floors. Rather, the image I had in mind was much more akin to that of a final boss’ castle. I wanted to make something grand, something magnificent, something like the ever majestic An*r Londo. Though, Anor L*ndo may be a bit too disproportionately large. I mean, I’m a man. I gotta dream big, but maybe not quite that big.With my thoughts in order, I decided to open up my stat page and check the amount of DP I had on hand.***General Information

One Who JudgesDP: 152400***And in doing so, I discovered that I had gained yet another strange title.***One Who Judges: One who detests sin and delivers judgement upon the guilty. All stats are increased by 50% whilst engaging a sinner. Sinners are denoted as those whose titles convict them of crime.***I raised a hand to my chin as I read its description. Well, it at least seems useful, so no harm in getting it, I guess. Wait. How exactly did I get this title anyway?“Hey Lefi, how exactly do people get titles?” I turned to the dragon, only to find that she was still in the middle of an interesting but bizzare one man act. That is, she was playing old maid against none other than herself.Her current predicament was one inspired by her own actions. She had bragged about how good she was at the game and challenged Lyuuin to a one on one showdown, only to end up under a metaphorical bus the moment she taught the other girl the game’s rules. Lefi had been completely and utterly destroyed, over and over again. Thus, she decided that she lacked experience and enrolled herself in a bootcamp in which she was both instructor and student. Lefi please. Old maid doesn’t support single player.“Titles, you ask?” She looked up from the cards in her hand and turned her eyes on me as she answered my question. “I’ve no choice but to admit that even I lack knowledge of their workings. I know only that they are inclined to appear following major events and that they label those that have strayed from the righteous path. Some claim that they are managed by a god, a watcher that observes our actions and provides us titles to match. The label stems from a lack of information, for the watcher is labeled a god for the sole reason that it is not a creature that we sentient beings can perceive. Still, it remains fact that our actions lead to a sort of recognition.”Well, that answer was a whole lot more profound than what I was expecting.“Wait, so does that mean there aren’t actually any real gods?”
“At the very least, I have yet to bear witness to any being reflective of the deities described in religious texts.”Lefi’s answer left me a bit surprised. The world I had been reincarnated in was different from my own. It was a whole other world, or as we Japanese would like to call it, an isekai. And as far as the isekai genre of literature was concerned, gods were a norm. Thus, I had always just assumed that they existed. But not even Lefi had met one. From that, I came to the conclusion that this world’s gods were no different from that of my previous world’s: they were beings that were impossible to perceive, assuming they even existed to begin with.“Speaking of titles,” I said. “Is Supreme Dragon the only one you’ve got?”
“I bear countless others. But I have chosen to keep them hidden away,” replied Lefi. “I have refrained from hiding only the Supreme Dragon title, for it conveys my identity to all who dare to examine me. I’ve the ability to obscure all information pertaining to me, in fact. I could very well conceal everything from my name to all of my titles with utmost ease.”Oh, I get it. She’s using her most fearsome title to scare away all the riff raff so everyone leaves her alone. That’s a pretty good life lesson right there.The fact that Lefi had the ability to hide her stats didn’t really catch me off guard. There were skills that allowed one to peek at another’s stats; it only made sense for the opposite to exist as well. I was quite interested in the skill and made a mental note to look through the catalogue for it later on. That reminds me… Illuna probably has a hidden skill or title or two, doesn’t she? I mean, she managed to escape all by herself, so it only makes sense. I probably shouldn’t be asking her about it though. The fact that she hasn’t told me of her own accord means it’s probably one of her most closely guarded secrets. Forcing it out of her would be in bad taste.“Why is it that you appear so disappointed?” asked Lefi.
“I kinda had this whole goal of being able to see all your stats, but it turns out that you can just shut me out whenever you feel like it,” I grumbled. I had never been able to see any more than what she wanted me to see.The dragon girl broke into a hearty laugh. “Then I suppose you have no choice but to grow more powerful. It is likely that you will be able to discern them should your level reach my own.”
“Yeah… no.” I rolled my eyes. “That’d probably take a couple hundred years. I’ll be long dead by the time I even reach your feet.”
“What?” The dragon eyed me, confused. “You need not concern yourself with the length of your lifespan. I believe not that it will be a factor.”
“Uh………what?” I stared at her, completely bamboozled. The words that she had nonchalantly spoken had caused my mind to grind to a halt.
“I cannot be certain in declaring that your life shall continue in perpetuity. Still, I’ve no doubt that it will span at least several thousand years, Yuki, for you are a demon that has spawned not through birth, but rather spontaneous generation. Do you recall what I have told you about magical particles?”
“Uh… yeah… I remember,” I said, as I dug through my memories. Let’s see… I think she said that I was basically a bunch of magical particles gathered around a core made up of the dungeon’s power.
“Demons whose bodies are composed of magical particles are long lived, to say the least. The act of breathing alone suffices as a method to restore the particles of which your body is composed and thereby all it requires to function. You will not perish if you remain unslain. [E1] You’ve the ability to regenerate, for even severed limbs shall reform themselves should you allow enough time to pass. The passage of time shall not be your end so long as magical particles continue to exist. In fact, I believe you’ve not even the need for sustenance.”Huh… now that she mentions it, I don’t think I’ve actually ever really felt hungry post reincarnation. A further moment’s worth of contemplating led me to realize that Shii and Rir, the dungeon’s monsters, were made the same way, which meant that they too had no need to fear the hand of time. Damn, that’s a shocker.It appears that my body is immune to age and all that accompanies it, that it does. I was so surprised that I ended up thinking to myself with a speech quirk befitting a samurai.“Wait, what about you then? I mean, you’ve already lived for a thousand years, so does that mean you’re the same way?”
“Like yours, my kind is long lived. And as I have grown more powerful than any other, my body has acclimated itself to magic particles. I believe that, unless I am slain, I too shall continue to exist for as long as there are magic particles.”
“That’s good… I doubt I’ll be bored no matter how long a life I’ve got ahead of me so long as I’ve got you by my side.” I turned to the dragon girl as I spoke. “Huh? What’s the matter? Why’d you suddenly turn all red?”
“I-It is nothing!” squealed Lefi before changing the topic. “I suppose you only asked me about titles because you had acquired anothe—WHAT!? WHY IS IT THAT YOU ARE LABELED THE SUPREME DRAGON’S OWNER!?”The lazy dragon cut herself off with a series of screeches the moment she checked my stats.“Oh, you never noticed that one?”
“Y-you dare treat me as you would some sort of pet!?”Yeah, that’s about the exact reaction I thought I’d get.“Oh come on,” I said with a teasing smirk. “Don’t let it get to you. It’s just a title given to you by some random thing that we can’t actually see. All that means is that it’s the objective truth.”
“Nrrrghhhh…” Lefi groaned angrily.
“So now that you know your place in the world, I’d say it’s about time you act a bit more pet-like. How about you try fawning all over me or sucking up to me for food?”
“Krhhghhhh!” Another frustrated groan escaped the dragon girl’s throat. “Do not get cocky! Yuki, I challenge you to a duel! Let us engage in a bout under fair terms!”
“Mwahahahaha!” I cackled. “Bring it on! If I win, you’ll have to get on all fours, walk around like a dog, and lick my feet!”
“T-That is quite the… interest you have, Yuki,” said Lefi, as she reeled away.
“Why the hell did you suddenly calm down and start thinking rationally!? What happened to getting all fired up!?”***[E1]: So basically, if he’s not killed he won’t die. Because, after all, people die if they’re killed.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. One more chapter finished, and only one more remains in the gap. Are you all as excited as I am? Probably, since I’m sure more than a few of you are waiting for the gap to close before eating all 73 chapters we’ve translated in one bingeing afternoon. I’ve done that on more than one occasion: Reading all the chapters available for a series in a single day. It’s tough, especially once I catch up. Then I have to wait for releases. QQ Anyway, let’s get to today’s questions.sinfuego asks: Also, just out of curiosity, what do you all think about Re:Zero?Well, speaking for myself, I haven’t actually watched the whole series. I’ve seen bits and pieces of it and know the general story, but I haven’t sat down and watched it as a whole. I get kind of squeamish with the mind break aspect of it.Utsuro Eurydice Nashiro asks: I’m thinking about posting stories of my own but I don’t know where to post them… any suggestions…?Joker: I’ll be straight, the best place would probably be Fanfiction.net or another site like that. (Shameless plug, my account there is Peter Skirata) A site like that can host stories and fanfictions for a long time, plus you can share it in the Discord. I’m sure the boss won’t mind.ST: Check out Western Lights Publishing if you’re interested in that sort of thing. I’m kind of affiliated with them?Teru asks: is ST a one big tentacle or a human with a tentacle growing somewhere in his body? And where does it grow? XDHe is a singular tentacle who has taken a human form. Maybe. We don’t really know. It’s all Cthuluian science when dealing with him.Last but not least, zekkendo asks: How do you feel about Shield Hero?In terms of the Web Novel, I haven’t read it at all. Can’t find it anywhere. Pls help me, everyone. Light novel, I’ve read up to volume 13, which is where the official translation is at right now. To me, it gets better after volume 4, where the main starting problem (won’t say due to spoilers) is resolved very nicely for Shield bro. And the anime, I’m enjoying it so far. Raphtalia is one to protect, for sure. Keep her safe, Shield bro.And that’s all the questions for today. Remember, if you have something you’d like to ask me, post it in the comments with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it next time. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Renovating The Dungeon — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerLefi, who’d assumed that she could beat me in a battle of wits, furiously stomped off as I childishly demolished her in a game of trump. Her destination was obvious—she was headed straight to bed so she could lie around and sulk. That in turn left me with the time and space I needed to return to my goal: renovating the dungeon.To start, I left the throne room and entered the cave. I then turned around such that I was facing the door leading back inside as I slid a finger through the air and fiddled around with the menu.It was time to add another floor. More specifically, I wanted a nice, flat prairie; a piece of land filled with naught but grass. And though creating a massive plain in the middle of a cave didn’t seem possible by any stretch of the imagination, it was. The dungeon’s mysterious powers rendered it a simple task so long as I had a sufficient amount of DP.Of course, I had no intention of just dumping a random prairie in the middle of the dungeon and calling it a day. The plan was just to start with a prairie and work my way up to something much more grand. All I had to do was manipulate the floor through the plethora of options and customizations the dungeon’s system offered.With that in mind, I expended a non-negligible amount of DP and brought the grassy field to life.“Wow…” I blinked a few times as I looked through the door. “It actually worked.”Before me was the exact item offered by the dungeon’s catalogue, a flat grassland that extended as far as the eye could see. Gazing at it immediately led me to recall what I had seen of the Japanese Alps. The two scenes contrasted each other to such a degree that they may as well have been polar opposites.One of the most mysterious parts of the alteration was that the door remained unchanged. It looked exactly as it had a few seconds ago despite now leading to a whole other place.Stepping through the door, I was greeted by green and blue. The lush vegetation that filled the field almost seemed to glimmer as it was illuminated by the sunlight. I was still technically inside of a cave. Yet, all I saw when I directed my gaze upwards was a clear blue sky—a sight as impossible as the gentle breeze that embraced me and sent the grass aflutter.The sole disturbance, the sole part of the scene that wasn’t sky or grass was a single, unnatural looking door, all by itself off in the distance. The door that led to the throne room. This is kinda a little late seeing as how I’ve already done a bunch of shit with it, but god damn, the dungeon sure can do a lot of shit. How does it all work anyway?I was unable to find an answer to my question, so I redirected my attention elsewhere and began wandering towards the inconspicuous door. After reaching it, I gave its knob a twist and stepped inside to confirm that the throne room was indeed on the other side.I noticed Illuna and the two maids flash me curious looks out of the corner of my eye, but I didn’t pay them much heed as I stepped back outside and circled behind the door to confirm that there really was nothing on the other side. My expression of disbelief was so primitive that I almost felt like a monkey in the midst of being introduced to the concept of a mirror. Just how far does this prairie go, anyway? It almost looks like an entire world of its own.Driven by curiosity, I spent a bit of time investigating. I walked around and flew about until I finally came to understand the size of my new domain. With the gate to the throne room as the centerpoint, it was about five kilometers in any given direction, save for up. It was only about a thousand meters high. The boundaries were delimited by a set of invisible walls, much like the blocking volumes that appeared in video games. I had actually hit my head on the invisible ceiling while flying around. It hadn’t hurt, but it had left me quite startled.All in all, I had to say that it was well worth the pretty penny it cost me. The area was larger than I’d anticipated, and I could expand it at will with the press of a button should I ever feel that it was starting to get a bit too cramped. Oh yeah, speaking of the menu…I began manipulating the dungeon’s UI. Specifically, I began sifting through the menu that allowed me to customize my newly added floor. It’s a bit bland as is, so I’ll add a river to make it less boring. Might as well throw in a few mountains off in the distance while I’m at it. Oh, there’s gotta be a bridge if there’s a river. And I also kinda want me some cherry blossoms, so I’ll throw in a tree. I do like me some cherry blossoms. Hmmm… looking at all this makes me want to throw in a nice, Japanese style building. Oh, what if I put one of those traditional inns? Y’know, a good old Japanese ryokan. I’m making a ryokan, then it goes without saying that I’m going to need a hot spring. Should probably make it a nice, luxurious open air bath while I’m at it. Oh, and can’t forget the garden. And the pond. And the koi that go in the pond. I remember seeing them somewhere in the menu for monsters. I’m pretty sure they don’t belong there, but whatever. Anyway, next, I’ll need to add…***And so, I ended up with a nice, riverside inn. The interior was expressive of traditional, old fashioned, Japanese tastes. It gave off an aura of refinement, and even just entering the space was enough to fill me with a sense of nostalgia. Ascending to the veranda allowed me to gaze at the beautiful cherry tree I’d set up and the pond beside it.It was a calming sight, one that put my heart at ease. Looking beyond the ryokan’s boundaries was a large grassy plain that extended effectively as far as the eye could see. And far off in the distance lay a range of rugged looking mountains.“Yeah, not too shabby, if I do say so myself.”After finally calming down, I found myself standing in front of a high class inn that featured a hot spring. The scene around it was so beautifully constructed that I was certain it would make a fine piece of art.The atmosphere around the inn was warm and friendly, the complete opposite of the solemn castle that I had originally set out to make. That said, I wasn’t complaining. I hadn’t planned on building the castle immediately after acquiring the plains. Besides, this whole pleasant atmosphere? Yeah, that was totally all planned. Yup. I totally didn’t accidentally get ahead of myself and randomly start adding shit without thinking because I let myself get carried away. None of that DP was wasted at all. None. At. All. I mean, just look at this thing. It’s gorgeous. It’s clearly just an extension of my wonderful, artsy mind. It’s all but natural given that I am the Demon Lord of Creativity. Mhm. Yup. All planned. This is totally just another important step one needs to take to become a true demon lord. Mwahahahaha!…Okay yeah no. Not even I know what I’m blabbering on about anymore.“Lunch is ready, Master!” Lyuuin stuck her head through the door as she tried to get my attention. “Wait a second! Where the heck am I!? What happened to the cave, and where’d this house come from!?”I had already known that I was going to get called for food eventually, so I’d built the inn right next to the door leading to the throne room. To that end, it was the first thing Lyuuin, who was half panicking, saw.A part of me had suspected that adding a floor would make travelling between the cave and the throne room much more painful than it needed to be, but it turned out that wasn’t the case at all. The door was much like the one in H*wl’s Moving Castle. I could change its destination as I opened it. In fact, anyone that was affiliated with the dungeon was capable of using that exact feature, which meant Illuna could do the same. Unfortunately, Lefi, Lyuuin, and Leila were all still treated as intruders, so they would have to bear with the inconvenience. Oh well. It kinda can’t be helped.“Oh, hey Lyuu. Gimme a second, I’ll be right over.”I was quite happy to have the maids in my service. I’d always been responsible for making our meals, but now that Leila was around, I no longer had to bother. She was one hell of a cook; she had somehow managed to learn how to make food from earth in the blink of an eye. Seeing her in action reminded me that girls were just that much better at cooking than guys. They were more naturally inclined to be good at it.While Leila was nothing short of excellent, the same couldn’t be said for Lyuu. Well… she’s trying, so good enough, I guess…“Huh? Wait, you’re not gonna explain how all this happened!?” Lyuu walked up to me as she continued to look around the prairie in wonder.
“Uhhh… Let’s just say that it’s because demon lords have got mysterious powers.”
“Sorry Master, but I ain’t followin’.”Yeah, figured.“To be honest, I don’t really understand it all that well myself. The only thing I can really tell you is that it’s possible because it is,” I said with a shrug. “Anyway, you get used to living here yet?”I hit Lyuu with the classic 1-2: giving her a vague response and voicing a question of my own.“Hmmmm…” She paused for a moment. “Well, to be honest, the fact that I’m here kinda makes me feel real weird. I thought that my life was totally over when I got turned into a slave, but now I’ve got myself a job again, and I’m workin’ like nothin’s happened.”
“Yeah, I getcha,” I laughed. “Life’s full of all sorts of surprises.”Case in point, yours truly. I literally came from another world. I’d say that’s about as big a surprise as surprises get.“But I’m happy I’m here,” said Lyuu. “The food’s good, my bed’s real comfy, and there’s all sorts of interestin’ stuff all around me. Best of all is that this place is Lord Fluffrir’s home! Oh yeah, that reminds me, Master, d’ya happen to know when Lord Fluffrir’s makin’ his next visit?”
“Uhhh… dunno. Guy’s as elusive as a phantom. He comes and goes as he pleases,” I replied in monotone.
“Why’re you sounding all deadpan all of a sudden?”Unlike me, Lyuu didn’t realize that Rir found dealing with her to be a rather difficult task. He just wasn’t sure how he was supposed to act given that she’d set him up on a pedestal. In fact, he’s practically been avoiding this place like the plague. I doubt he’ll be showing up any time soon unless I ask him to.“Cease your prattling and come to the table at once! Our meal will cool should you take any lo—” Lefi momentarily froze as she emerged from the throne room. “A prairie? How bizarre. I see that you are up to yet another one of your strange antics, Yuki.”
“Whaddya mean strange antics!? That’s rude. I was clearly crafting something that’ll make this dungeon grow even further.”
“It matters not what you intended,” she shrugged. “In either case, it would be best if you returned unless you wish for us to devour your portions.”
“Fiiiine…”Lyuu and I offered a synchronized, lethargic reply before slowly following Lefi back into the throne room.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. And with that, the gap has been closed. Instead of reading a pile of doodoo that other people place in front of you, you can now read the cardboard level translations of this entire series here. Woohoo! I hope everyone enjoys following along to the antics of Yuki, Lefi, and the rest of the crew. I know I sure have been. Also, a kind of announcement. Since we’re done with the gap, the next round of #AskJoker questions will be done on Chapter 74. So read up through there in order to get your questions from this chapter that you ask. Remember, chapter 74. Now, onto the questions.nakakure asks: what do you think about Konosuba? As well as what do you think about Grimgal?I haven’t seen Grimgal, or read it. But Konosuba, i’ve read up to about volume 9-10 or so and it’s really good. The anime was hilarious as well. Kazuma’s voice actor was spot on, with the sounds and expressions he made.And that’s actually the only two questions we had for this run. But thank you, everyone, who directed me towards Yoraikun for the Shield Hero web novel. I know what I’ll be reading when I catch up with Growth Cheat. That’s right, probably Death Mage. Then Skeleton Knight. And then probably Shield bro. Remember, if you have any questions for me, post it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker, and I’ll answer in the next chapter we release, which will be Chapter 74. See y’all in the next chapter!

A Hot Spring’s Warmth
TL/ED: SupremeTentacle“Whew…”I couldn’t help but let out a relaxed sigh as my body sank into the bathtub. I’d recently finished making myself a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn equipped with a hot spring.The bathtub that the hot spring fed into was made of high quality Japanese cypress. It was quite wide, and could fit at least two people regardless of how they stretched themselves. It was an open air bath without a roof, so you’d be able to see the moon and stars shine down from above so long as you just looked up. The only artificial source of light was a dim lamp, so the dazzling, starry sky was mirrored atop the water’s surface.At first, I wanted to make it so the inn would be accompanied by an eternal night, but soon realized that it would not only be disorienting, but also lead to potential inconvenience. That was why I ended up giving the dungeon floor a proper day-night cycle that mirrored whatever was outside.“This sure feels nice, doesn’t it?”I spoke to Shii, who happened to be floating about in the water. For some odd reason, Shii seemed really fond of bathing; the slime had the tendency to hop in the bath and join me whenever I decided to use it. At first, I expected it to swell up as soon as it entered, but nothing like that ever happened. Instead, bathing caused Shii to gain a sort of sheen and lustre. It was almost like it would cycle all the dirty fluids outside its body and take in cleaner ones after getting in the water.“Are you done yet?” Illuna slid open the bathroom’s sliding door, and smiled happily as she entered.
“Oh, hey Illuna. I thought you said you weren’t going to get in ’till a bit later?”
“Hehe. Sorry.”The young vampire giggled and broke into an innocent smile as she apologized.“Can you please wash my hair?” she asked.
“Sure. Grab a seat and I’ll be right on it.”
“Yay!”She cheered as she sat herself down on a chair near the shower. I followed suit and pulled up a second chair, settling myself down behind her as I grabbed the shower head.“Ehehe.” Illuna giggled happily as I began to wash her.
“Sounds like someone’s in a good mood.”
“Mhm!” The vampire nodded happily. “It’s because we’re spending time together again!”Now that she mentions it, I’ve been too busy to pamper her lately. I should probably take her out to play in the fields sometime soon. Oh, I know! We could have a picnic. I guess we’d have to invite everyone else, but that could make for a whole day’s worth of entertainment.The bathroom door opened as I started excitedly fleshing out my picnic plans.“What a surprise. I expected not for you to be in the bath, Illuna.”
“Hi Lefi!”
“Oh, it’s just you, Lefi… Wait! Why the hell are you here!?”
“I believe it is I that should be doing the questioning. Why is it that you are staring at me as would a fool?”
“B-Because I don’t know why you’re joining us in the bath.”
“Can I not?” Lefi frowned.
“W-well, I mean you can… It’s just…”I didn’t mind Illuna joining me because she was still just a kid. Lefi, however, made for a much more questionable bath buddy. Her body was on the verge of maturity, just at the point where I wasn’t sure whether or not I was supposed to think of her as a kid.“Oh, I know!” Illuna said. “You must’ve wanted to be together with Yuki too! Right, Lefi?”
“W-What a preposterous suggestion! I-I merely wished for him to wash my hair. His proficiency in the task is the sole driving force that has led to the current scenario.” Lefi’s cheeks reddened as she denied Illuna’s assumption.
“I-I see… A-Alright, why don’t you go ahead and get in the tub so I can get Lefi cleaned up, Illuna?”
“Kaaay!”Illuna, who I’d just finished washing, happily assented and entered the tub. She was soon replaced by Lefi, who naturally moved over and took the younger girl’s seat.I couldn’t help but let my eyes be drawn to the creamy white skin that peeked out from between the strands of her glossy silver hair. I followed the contours of her body and traced her womanly figure all the way from the nape of her neck, through to her cute, rounded shoulders, and eventually all the way down to the slender curves that made up her back. Oh god damn it, what am I doing!? Alright, alright. Empty mind, pure heart. Empty mind, pure heart.I took a quiet but deep breath to calm myself down, all while hoping that Lefi wouldn’t notice my fast-beating heart. Only after I regained my composure did I finally start to wet her hair.She would occasionally leak hot, captivating sighs as I washed her. Hearing them forced my heart to hit the gas and accelerate once more. E-Empty mind, pure heart! Empty mind pure heart! Calm down already, heart! Why the hell are you beating so quickly? This is Lefi we’re talking about here, you know? She’s just a lazy dragon that never does anything but eat sweets!“A-alright Lefi, I’m done.”I breathed a sigh of relief as I finished rinsing the bubbles out of her hair.As soon as I was done, the ancient dragon relaxed herself and let her body lean back against my own. She was warm. Feeling the gentle sensation of her skin on mine caused my heart to once again kick itself into overdrive.“W-What’re you do—”
“I found that wonderfully relaxing, Yuki, but it appears my sentiment is not shared. Your breath is rather ragged. Did you truly find my naked body that charming?”She broke out into a mischievous grin as looked up at me from below.She totally knew!?“S-Sure does sound all high and mighty coming from someone whose body looks just like a kid’s. There’s no way a child like you you’d ever turn me on.”
“A child!? How dare you!” Lefi shouted in a burst of angry confusion. “Your claim is unconvincing given that its source is an individual that has only just finished panting all over my body!”
“I-I was only panting because my nose was stuffed! It had nothing to do with you!”
“What manner of awful excuse is that supposed to be!?”
“Geez! Come on! You guys are going to catch colds if you don’t get in soon.”
“…”
“…”Neither Lefi or I could come up with any sort of reply, so we both quietly ended up getting in after getting reprimanded.“Ahhh… How splendid. I knew not that hot springs were this relaxing,” Lefi smiled.
“Yup! It feels super good, right Shii?”Shii flopped around underwater as if to agree.“Glad you guys are enjoying it.”And so, the four of us leisurely relaxed and enjoyed ourselves. Quite a bit of time passed by without any of us saying anything, but I didn’t find it the slightest bit awkward. In fact, I enjoyed the silence quite a bit.I know I’m not old enough to have kids just yet, but I think I’m starting to understand how it feels to be a father.“I admit that this makes for some good scenery, but remind me. For what reason did you suddenly decide to create this environment?” Lefi was the first to break the silence. Her curious gaze was set on the grassy plains that lay beyond the hotspring’s confines.“Well, I was kind of thinking about making myself a castle.”
“I fail to follow.”
“You know, a castle? A giant ass fortress? I decided to make this plain so I could get some space ready for it.”
“I… am not quite sold on your obsession with castles,” said Lefi. ”But very well. Let us work under the assumption that this is indeed all for the sake of a castle. What manner of thought prompted you to decide that the most natural building to construct next to a castle was an inn featuring a hot spring?”
“Dunno. I’d already finished building it by the time I even considered asking myself that.”
“T-That… would certainly explain it.” Lefi seemed to acknowledge and accept my reasoning, or rather, my lack thereof, despite clearly being confused.A bit more time passed in silence, only to be interrupted by something suddenly beginning to shake.“Illuna? You okay?” I asked.
“Yeah… Just sleepy.”All the warmth and comfort had caused the little girl to start drifting off.“Try staying awake just a bit longer, ‘kay? Let’s get you to bed.”
“Mmkay…”I took Illuna’s hand to steady her and stop her from shaking.“Could you help Illuna get dressed, Lefi?”
“Very well.”
“Thanks. And as for you Shii, you can prob—Woah!”I looked inside the water only to find that the slime had stretched and lost its usual shape. It was so large and stretched so thin that it looked like it was on the verge of dissolving.“Are you alright?”Shii shook itself up and down, indicating that it was perfectly fine. I somehow managed to understand that it was planning to soak a little bit longer, and could get out by itself once it was done.“If you say so.”I smiled wryly as I got out of the bath with Lefi and Illuna in tow. A ray of moonlight illuminated the area around us as the three of us made our way back over to the changeroom.<– Prev — Next –>

Another Day in the Newcomers’ Lives
TL/ED: SupremeTentacle“Man, that was tirin’. Lefi sure doesn’t like taking it easy on me, does she? Like, geez. Why’s she always gotta take everythin’ so seriously…?”Lyuu, the maid, heaved a sigh as she collapsed onto her bed. She was tired. In fact, she was so tired that she’d even forgotten to take off her uniform before attempting to sleep.Yet, her exhaustion seemed to rapidly fade the moment she planted her face in the silky mattress beneath her. It was so soft and fluffy that it almost seemed to whisk her complaints away as it enveloped her in its gentle embrace. The beds in her newfound Master’s domain were simply divine. All the other beds she’d ever used were but shoddy wooden boards in comparison. Sleeping on them always left her joints aching in pain each and every single morning.“Geez. You ought to be more careful. Your uniform is going to end up plastered with wrinkles if you keep that up.”
“Right…. Good point.”The bed was so alluring that she couldn’t actually bring herself to get off of it and take off her clothes until after the other maid, Leila, reminded her. And even then, her actions carried with them a heavy air of reluctance.There was very little beneath her uniform, so her body was laid bare the moment she took it off. She was on the more slender side, but that wasn’t to she say looked like a man or a child. Her figure was undoubtedly feminine; she had curves in all the right places.Lyuu and Leila were on good terms with one another even though they belonged to different races. That, in part, was due to their heritages. Demons, beastkin, and demihumans got along with one another. But with that said, the disparate species’ willingness to cooperate with one another was unnatural, born of an external influence. The races lived in different environments and had different cultural customs. The only reason they were so willing to accept one another was because humans discriminated against all of them equally. They treated them all like trash. Human nations were bigger and tended to be more powerful, so the races really had no choice but to get along, else risk being toppled by the humans mid-conflict.The elves were the only race the humans couldn’t carelessly antagonize. As denizens of the forest, they were capable of making use of the “Forest’s Secrets,” which the humans knew could cause them incredible harm. To that end, elves and humans intentionally avoided getting in each others’ ways; both parties practiced noninterference. All the other races were forced to face the humans’ desire for conquest. That is, the humans and the other three non-elven races had been locked in a series of skirmishes and wars for hundreds upon hundreds of years.At first, it had been a stalemate. But in recent years, the tides of war had started to turn.In the humans’ favour.Individually speaking, humans were weak. One on one, humans were less fearsome in combat than all the other races, but they possessed a deadly trait that none of the other races could overcome: numbers. They overwhelmed the other races not through the quality of their warriors, but rather through sheer quantity. All the other races almost always found themselves outnumbered ten to one on the battlefield.And that was why the demons, beastkin, and demihumans treated each other with kindness. They realized that they needed to cooperate in order to cope with the looming human threat.“Oh yeah, I guess I’m a bit late in askin’, but why’d you decide to stay behind anyway?”
“I could have sworn that I already gave my reason. I believe I said I was here because I wanted to pay off my deb—”
“Yeah right.”Lyuu, who was in the middle of putting on the cute nightgown gifted to her by her master, cut Leila off while rolling her eyes.“I know that’s what you’ve been sayin’, but I’m not askin’ fer that. I wanna know how you really feel. I’m pretty sure you’ve got another reason hidden away somewhere, seein’ as how you’re a horned sheep demon, y’know?”Beastkin and demons were both races that contained a slew of different subraces within. Each subrace was further divided into clans. Both beastkin and demons had the tendency to append their clan names to their own names in order to differentiate between different groups within the same species.Of course, Lyuu herself was no exception to the rules. The Gyroll in her name was actually her clan’s name.She knew that Leila was a demon, and thus should’ve had a second name to give. But in spite of that, she had named herself as Leila and nothing more. As far as Lyuu was concerned, her lack of a clan name was a dead giveaway to the fact that she was a horned sheep demon. There was a single horned sheep clan, so they had no need for an additional identifier.Horned sheep demons were notorious for two very well known reasons. The first was that they were all female, and the second was that the entire clan was made up of overly curious academics, or scholars, as others would call them. These scholars were ridiculously inquisitive. They would find something to obsess over and get so into their research that they’d forgo both rest and nutrition just to learn the slightest bit more.They were so famous amongst the demons that knowledge of their eccentricities had not only spread to the beastkin, but also integrated itself into their common sense.Despite that, the maids’ benefactor seemed not to know.“Well, I was not lying, at the very least. I effectively gave up on life the moment I became a slave. Our Lord saved me from living the rest of my days as a miserable, broken tool, and I am truly grateful he did,” said Leila, her lips curved into a slight smile. “But more importantly, do you not just find him interesting? Most Demon Lords are violent good for nothings that lack even the ability to process logical thought. Our Lord, on the other hand, is clearly an intellectual capable of reasoning. Do you not find this the perfect opportunity to discover the unknown? To learn more about labyrinths and maybe even the Demon Lord race as a whole? Would it not be a waste to throw away this wonderful chance? This outstanding opportunity?”
“U-Uh… Sure…”Lyuu couldn’t help but awkwardly nod along. She’d always thought of Leila as calm, composed, and seemingly carefree, so she couldn’t help but be taken aback by the other maid’s sudden, passionate outburst. Simply looking at her as she was now was enough to open the warwolf’s eyes to the fact that Leila truly was a member of the horned sheep clan.“So have ya figured anythin’ out yet?”
“Not quite. I have only uncovered three facts thus far. The first is that our Lord possesses an ability too mysterious for me to define quite yet. Secondly, he is quite the interesting person to observe due to the nature of his eccentricities. Finally, he adores both Lefi and Illuna, and would stop at nothing to ensure their safety.”
“You know what…? I think you’re right. Our master is kinda weird, isn’t he?”If Lyuu was to try to sum up her master in a single word, she would undoubtedly choose the word “mysterious.”Her master would always produce tools the likes of which she’d never heard of, let alone seen, and manipulate them with the skill of a seasoned craftsman. He was capable of casting the most devastatingly powerful spells like it was naught but childsplay. And yet, he somehow lacked common sense. Many of the things he did not know were basic facts that even the youngest child could recite.Still, he radiated warmth. His very presence put her heart at ease—even though she barely knew him.And that was precisely why she thought the most accurate way to describe him was to label him a mystery-filled anomaly.Lyuu had to admit that she would have loved to work for him even if he hadn’t been so warm and soothing. She didn’t get yelled at here. And though she was technically a maid, she didn’t feel nearly as restricted as a maid ought to be. The warwolf was more or less allowed to do whatever she pleased. She was often forced to play with people, but she always ended up enjoying it in the end, so she didn’t particularly mind. Her only complaint, if she really had to name one, was that a certain immature individual wouldn’t stop forcing her into rematches because said individual happened to hate losing.Plus, that sole demerit was effectively rendered irrelevant in the face of the delicious meals she found herself having on a day to day basis, the comfortable hot spring she could enter at her leisure, and the unworldly bed that awaited her each and every night. Lyuu honestly thought her work environment to be the best there was. She couldn’t even begin to imagine anything trumping it, especially since there was a Fenrir around. The warwolf was a bit sad that she hadn’t seen it too often as of late, but again, all the other benefits made it so she didn’t particularly mind.She was certain that her friends back home would’ve ended up grinding their teeth in envy should she tell them about her circumstances.“I don’t think Master’d really mind, y’know? You might as well come out and tell him.”
“I do not disagree. However, I wish to observe both our Lord and his labyrinth in their most natural states. I believe it would be much less difficult for me to conduct unbiased observations without his consent than the alternative.”
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” Lyuu nodded. “He might get all conscious about it and act a bit different ’round you if he knows you’re observin’ him.”“Okay, that is enough about me. Why don’t we talk about you instead?” asked Leila. “I remember hearing something about the Gyroll clan, which happens to lead the warwolf subspecies as a whole. The poor chief’s daughter ran away from home rather recently. I don’t suppose that you wo—”
“Uwaaaahhh!?”Lyuu started frantically flailing her arms around out of sheer panic as she cut the other girl off in an attempt to stop her from saying any more.“H-How did you know!? W-wait, I mean, uhm…”But she failed spectacularly and ended up confirming the other maid’s suspicions of her own accord.“Don’t worry, I am not the type to talk. Though, I cannot guarantee that I will not make a minor mistake or two if you happen to tell anyone else my secret.”
“I-I promise I won’t tell anyone, so make sure you don’t say nuthin’ ’bout me either, ‘kay!?”Though Leila was perfectly satisfied, having achieved her goal, she couldn’t help but question her fellow maid’s motives.“You seem rather keen on keeping your identity a secret, but… why? Are there any demerits to letting our Lord know?”
“I-I mean… ain’t it just, you know, embarrassin’? I mean, I ain’t exactly what people imagine when you think of ‘a chief’s daughter.'”Leila gave a wry smile as she watched Lyuu fidget about in an attempt to hide her embarrassment.“What are you talking about, Lyuu? You’re plenty cute.”
“R-Really? I-I dunno, I don’t really think I am…”
“Yeah, now why don’t we get to bed? I know we’re not required to wake up early, but I think we should still do our best to get out of bed before our Lord.”Leila reached toward the lamp by her bedside and turned it off.“Ugh… I feel like you just totally had me played, but ‘kay. Night, Leila.”
“Good night, Lyuu.”<– Prev — Next –>

Picnic
TL/ED: SupremeTentacle“Yay! It’s picnic time! We’re gonna have a picnic!”Illuna spoke in a sing-songy tone as she happily skipped through the grassy field beneath her. She swung her arms about as she did, dragging both Lefi’s hand and my own all over the place.The young vampire was beaming. Though, that wasn’t really saying much, seeing as how she was more or less always beaming. Her cheerful smile had long become one of her defining features. Today, however, she somehow managed to make said smile seem even more gleeful than usual. Seeing her like that reminded me of a certain school idol and the catchphrase she’d always pair with a smile. What was it again? Nico Nico Nii? [1]“I know you are excited, Illuna, but it would be best for you to stop fidgeting. You are sure to tucker yourself out lest you cease,” said Lefi.
“But we’re going on a picnic! How can I not be excited? Doesn’t it just sound like so much fun!?”
“I know not what a picnic is. I recall little besides that I was suddenly awoken for it.”Lefi squeezed her words out between a few tired-sounding yawns. Being as lazy as she was, she normally would have preferred to sleep in.“Uhmmm, well, a picnic is…Uhmm… it’s like when you…”Illuna tilted her head to one side as she attempted to recall my explanation.“I forgot,” she said with an innocent smile. “What was it again?”
“Picnics are when you go outside with a bunch of people, eat stuff, and play around until you drop, all under a beautiful blue sky,” I explained. Man, I know I’m rarely ever swamped with work, but it still does feel nice to just cut loose and just totally relax. I mean, I did put in a slight bit more effort lately, so this break is totally well deserved.“A beautiful blue sky…?” Lefi rolled her eyes. “This backdrop is but a blatant forgery, is it not?”
“Oh shut up Lefi,” I groaned. “Look, you’re right, but lay off. It doesn’t really matter if the sky’s real or not. It’s all about the mood.”
“Uhm, Master, I love playing around as much as the next gal, but there ain’t really anything to do here. All I see is an empty field of grass. Though, I guess it does kinda look like a good place to take a nap,” said Lyuu.She was standing behind us so I couldn’t actually see her, but I was certain that she’d been looking in an attempt to find whatever was supposed to entertain us for the rest of the outing.Speaking of which, our group was structured as follows: Lefi and I were taking up the lead, with Illuna between us, holding both our hands. Leila was right behind the three of us, quietly following along as she maintained her ever-composed expression and held onto the basket that contained our lunches.Behind Leila was Shii, sitting atop an unamused looking Rir. I hadn’t seen Rir around too often lately and today served to prove exactly why that was the case. Lyuu was following him around and attempting to pamper him. She clearly thought she was doing him a service, but the fenrir couldn’t seem to think of her actions as anything but annoying.“N nap? That does sound like a rather pleasant proposition,” Lefi yawned yet again as she scanned the field for a place to sleep.
“No napping,” I said. “Look, I know you’re probably thinking that there isn’t anything to do, but there is. Just trust me. I’ve made some pretty sweet plans for us. Speaking of which, that’s the spot I was looking for right over there.”I pointed towards a small hill. Like the rest of the field, it was covered with grass. Its only defining feature was the creek that lay beside it. I created the hill just several days prior, specifically so that we could use it for today’s events. It felt as if I was no longer using the plains for the purpose I had originally intended them for, but I didn’t particularly mind.Upon reaching our destination, I pulled a picnic blanket out from my item box and placed it on top of a patch of grass a bit away from the bottom of the hill.“Is this where you plan for us to eat?” asked Leila.
“Later, yeah. I’m just setting it up right now so we have a place to sit. Feel free to set everything down here too. It should be far enough out of the way not to get plowed over.”I reached into my item box and pulled out a wooden sled as I spoke. It was one of the larger models and could clearly fit two adults without discomfort. The sled’s bottom was flat and had a bit of a glossy sheen to it, perhaps because it was laminated. It looked like it would have no problems going down the hill despite it being grassy.“What’s that thing for?” asked our resident vampire.
“It’s a fun toy. Follow me, I’ll show you how to use it.”I led Illuna atop the hill and sat her down in the sled. Rather than immediately getting on it myself, I stood behind it and positioned myself to push it.“Are you ready?”
“Yup!”
“Then let’s go!”I kicked off the ground and began pushing the sled downhill to give it an initial burst of speed then hopped in. The weight of my body suddenly falling onto the wooden vehicle gave it something along the lines of a second wind, accelerating it even further.“Wow! We’re going so fast!”Riding the sled gave me a bit of a rush, a thrill similar yet different from the one I got from flying. Flying was more demanding, but at the same time, it provided more control. Sledding was the opposite. All I had to do was lean back and let gravity do most of the work for me.We rushed down the hill then slowly decelerated until we finally stopped right around where Lefi, Rir and the maids were gathered.“You were right! That really was super fun!”
“Told you so. You see, this is clearly why I’m the master of all things fun. If you’re ever bored, then come to me and I’ll fix everything right up.”
“Mhm! You’re totally awesome!”Though I was acting smug, I knew that I didn’t deserve any sort of title. All I was doing was borrowing existing ideas.“Wow, Master. I hafta say, that looks really fun,” said Lyuu, her eyes sparkling.
“So you are using the hill itself as a toy? While the idea is fundamentally quite simple, it appears interesting nonetheless,” added Leila.
“You guys want to give it a shot?”
“You betcha!”
“I would love to, but is it really okay for me to join you in your leisures, my Lord?”
“Of course.”And so, I went back up the hill with the two maids. Lyuu was really excited, so she ended up taking the front seat. Leila sat in the back while I stood behind them in order to give the sled the push it needed to get going.“Uhhh… wow Leila. Your boobs sure are big…” muttered Lyuu, under her breath.
“Come again?” said Leila.
“You know what, it’s nuthin’. Just do me a good one and pretend ya didn’t hear it, ‘kay? I’d rather not start feelin’ even more sorry for myself.”
“Hm?”The energy and excitement seemed to drain from Lyuu’s body as she came into contact with Leila’s bountiful bosom. Her face warped a bit, as if to show that she was dealing with all sorts of conflicting emotions. I almost started to feel sorry for her, but instead ended up stifling a laugh as I recalled a certain character stating proclaiming being flat chested was a status symbol. [2]“Hey Master, why’s it look like you’re tryin’ ta stop yourself from gigglin’ or somethin’?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Now let’s go,” I said, as I began pushing the sled.
“Hey wait, answer my question first! Wa-wait, I said waitttttt!”I ignored her and began pushing the sled with all the power my body could muster. And as I was a Demon Lord, it went without saying that they ended up gaining quite a good bit of speed. That is, they went so fast I’d almost thought that the sled had rocket-powered boosters attached to it.“Hoooooly crap, that was way faster than I thought it’d be…Y-You’re really strong, Master… We accelerated so quickly that my thighs ended up jerkin’ up and stuff…” Lyuu paused a bit after each sentence in order to take a deep breath.
“That was incredible. I presume that I should not have expected anything less from a Demon Lord, though,” said Leila.She was calm now, but even the ever-composed Leila had ended up leaking a shout of surprise when the sled first picked up speed. I was a bit curious about her expectations, but ended up shelving the thought for the time being. I instead glanced at the one person that had yet to experience sledding down Demon Lord Hill.“Well Lefi, you’re next.”
“I-I would not mind yielding my turn to another.”
“Oh come on, don’t say that. Just try it. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.”Lefi seemed a bit reluctant to join in on the fun, so I bent down, stuck my head between her legs, grabbed them, and lifted her as I stood back up. In other words, I began giving her an over-the-shoulder piggyback ride.“W-What are you doing!?”
“Being inclusive. I’d totally feel bad for you if you were the only person left out of the fun.”I tightened my grip on her legs to ensure that she wouldn’t be able to escape and forced her up the hill with sled in tow.“I-I understand! I shall ride that damned sled of yours, so cease this immediately! Put me down!” The dragon began shouting in panic. “Stop this! Stop it now! Wait! Wait!? What manner of insanity is this!? Yuki!? Heed my words and cease this immediately! Yuki!!”
“Don’t worry, Lefi. I know that a Supreme Dragon like you couldn’t enjoy a regular sled ride, so I made sure to get something special ready for you. Hold on tight. You might fall off if you don’t.”I positioned the sled such that it was facing down the hill and got on with her still attached to my shoulders.“Y-you have got to be kidding meeeeeee!?”I wasn’t able to dash to give myself a boost this time around, so I instead used wind magic, which I conveniently just happened to learn how to use just a few days ago.“Mwahahaha!”I laughed in a manner befitting a Demon Lord as an explosive amount of force suddenly smashed into the sled, accelerating it to its highest speed to date.“What was that!? I’m certain we were lifted off the ground!”
“God damn! That was awesome! I can see another bump right over there. What do you say to round 2?”
“I would very much like to sit out. Wait. Yuki? I’m beggiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”The wind had been completely knocked out of Lefi’s lungs by the time we hit the bottom of the hill. She almost looked like she was on the verge of hyperventilating.“D-Damn you…” she complained. “You went far too fast, and intentionally, at that!”
“Don’t you normally go way faster when you’re flying anyway?”
“Flying and sledding are not in any which way the same experience!”I wasn’t going to openly admit it, but I understood exactly where she was coming from. In my previous life, I had a friend explain a similar concept to me. He was perfectly fine with bungee jumping. In fact, he loved it. However, he couldn’t stand drop towers or any other rides that effectively involved freefalling. That is, he only enjoyed falling when he felt that he was in control. Lefi seemed to be the same, she couldn’t tolerate high speeds unless they were brought about by her own actions.“I clearly had the wrong idea here. I should have been worrying about your fears instead of worrying about you feeling left out, huh? Who would’ve thought that the supposed oh so mighty supreme dragon wouldn’t even be able handle a children’s game?”“Ugh…”Lefi groaned in response to my teasing. She stayed limp and lifeless for a few moments after, but then underwent a sudden change. I was expecting her to just sigh and get over it. But I was wrong.A fearless grin had made itself onto her face.“Reflecting upon it has led to to a realization, Yuki. I now believe that in truth, I did enjoy the experience. In fact, I enjoyed to such an extent that I would very much like to repeat it. What say you to joining me on another ride?”The way her eyes shone signaled that it was time for me to back off.“I uh… just went. It wouldn’t be fair for me to go twice in a row, so I think I’ll let someone else take my place.”But I wasn’t allowed to escape.“Do not say that. I am certain that it is an experience you will enjoy.”She paraphrased the words I’d said to her a few minutes earlier and threw them right back to me as she got off my shoulders and wrapped both her arms around me from behind. Her grip was tight; she was using far too much of her strength for me to escape.“Damn it Lefi, you’re embarrassing me. Could you save the cuddles for when we’re in private?”“Embarrassed? Have we not already bathed together? What more is there to be embarrassed about?”Lefi materialized her wings and brought both the sled and I back atop the hill.“You know what? Fine, bring it on. I love thrill rides, and the hill’s not even that tall. I’ll end up enjoying the hell out of this regardless of how fast you make me go.”
“And what, precisely made you think that you would be using the hill? I will instead be preparing a special track, one designed entirely for your sake.”
“Wait, what!?”
“You provided me special treatment. It is only fair that I reciprocate it, is it not?”The ground began to rumble as the supreme dragon drew a horizontal line through the air with one of her arms.“The heck is that!?”A massive glacial structure containing twists, turns, loops, and vertical plunges emerged from the earth. It was a veritable roller coaster track, one that even came equipped with guardrails that prevented any potential riders from falling off.“Are you really going to sled through all that, Yuki? Wow! You’re so cool!”
“Whew… I gots to say, that looks like way too much for lil’ old me to handle.”
“What an intricate spell. I almost cannot believe it took her only a second to craft such a massive track.”The peanut gallery began commenting as if this whole ordeal was none of their business.“That thing’s way out of scale no matter how you look at it! How the hell’s a sled even supposed to make it all the way through!?”
“Worry not. You have always seen to my needs and provided me with the care I required. And now that it has come time for me to reciprocate it,  you can trust that I will do the same. I will be accelerating you through the use of wind magic. Needless to say, your speed will far surpass the speed you had brought me to only moments prior.”“That sounds like an awful idea though!?”
“Now go! And forget not your resolve, for you will require a force of will akin to that of a man confronting his demise!”
“That’s not something I waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!”Lefi pettily began accelerating me with magic before I could even finish voicing my complaints.“Hahahaha!” She cackled. “Know my wrath! Suffer the weight of my resentment!”
“God damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!!”[1] Love live reference. [2] Lucky star reference.<– Prev — Next –>

Picnic — Continued
Translations: SupremeTentacle
Proofreading: The readers that point out typos and stuff!“Nnnrrggghh…” Lefi’s expression twisted in annoyance.Her thrill ride, which I dubbed the Supreme Dragon Coaster, had failed to serve its intended purpose. At first, I had thought it to be something way beyond what I, or anybody, could handle, but I’d always been the type to love thrills. My wails of anguish transformed into shouts of glee shortly after the “ride” started.“You mad, Lefi? You that mad that I wasn’t scared?” I boasted.
“Nrggh… Very well, I admit that the bounds of your courage surpassed my expectations.”Her words were bitter and clearly full of resentment. Seeing the triumphant look on my face caused her to clench her teeth and grind them in an expression of indignance and frustration.“Heh. That little joyride was nothing by my standards. You’ll need to do much more if you want to scare me.”
“You may claim whatever you so please, but know that the first sound you made upon experiencing it was a cry of terror,” grumbled Lefi.
“Can we eat soon? My tummy’s rumbling…”
“Oh, right. Sorry Illuna, we got a little sidetracked. Well, Lefi? What do you say we call this silly argument off for now so we can have lunch?”
“Very well.”
“Alright then, let’s get everything set up. Leila?”
“Immediately, my Lord.”Leila flipped the lid off the basket she was carrying and placed its contents atop the picnic sheet. Once she was done, I said grace, the Japanese way, and began to dig in. Likewise, the girls did the same. All but one of them repeated my “itadakimasu,” with perfect pronunciation. Lyuu, the only exception, stumbled over the words a bit. She still seemed a bit unaccustomed to the foreign phrase.Saying grace had started off as just habit only I had at first, but Illuna and Lefi had adopted it and turned it into a part of our culture back when it was still just the three of us. And as such, the maids had seen no reason not to pick up on it as well.“Wow, there’s so much karaage! My favourite!” [1]Illuna’s eyes immediately began to sparkle as soon as she saw what we were going to have for lunch. We had a whole slew of different picnic foods prepared, but her hungry gaze remained glued on the one she enjoyed the most.“Yup. We made plenty, so feel free to eat as much as you’d like.”Karaage, or Japanese fried chicken, as some called it, naturally required us to find, well, chicken. I wasn’t really sure how we were supposed to get chicken, so I ended up using rockbird meat instead.Rockbirds were an interesting sort of monster that one could find not too far from the dungeon. Their bodies were covered in feathers as tough as stone, as one could infer from their names. That, however, wasn’t their only namesake. Rockbirds were also known to sing whenever they entered combat. Specifically, they’d start screaming in a way that strongly reminded me of death metal and other similar genres of music. Rockbird meat was delicious. It was soft. Flavorful juices would come leaking out of it with each and every bite. The best part was that its taste wasn’t too strong. It didn’t override the seasonings we enhanced it with.“Man, this meat is good. I guess going out of my way to hunt monsters just for today’s sake really was worth it after all.”
“This is monster meat? What kind?” asked Lyuu.
“Rockbird.”
“Ohh, rockbird. So that’s why these taste so good, huh?” Lyuu paused for a few moments to process what she heard before suddenly breaking into a shout. “Wait, did you just say rockbird!? The destroyer tier ones? Ain’t those super high class ingredients!?”
“Destroyer tier? What’s that?”
“Wait, ya don’t know the tiers? Er, I guess ya don’t since you was askin’, huh?”The warwolf stopped to take a bite before continuing.“R-Right, so monsters are ranked into tiers based on how threatenin’ they are. Destroyers are supposed able to cause as many casualties as a war, all on their own,” she stated a matter-of-factly.
“How many tiers are there?”
“Countin’ all of them, there are seven: non-threats, hazards, menaces, destroyers, disasters, catastrophes, and calamities. And that’s in ascendin’ order of how much damage they can cause.”At first, I assumed that a destroyer would cause tens of thousands of casualties, as they apparently required entire armies to subjugate, but I was apparently off by a whole two orders of magnitude. The armies in this world weren’t as large scaled as the ones back in my old world; subjugating a destroyer typically led to the sacrifice of one to two hundred troops.“Huh. I never realized rockbirds were that threatening. It only takes me a single swing of my greatsword to take one out, so I’d always thought of them as easy, delicious prey.”
“Er… well, that’s just ‘cause you defy common sense, Master. But you know what, that ain’t somethin’ I’ll mind so long as I get to keep eatin’ delicious meals,” said Lyuu. Her expression indicated that she wasn’t sure whether or not she should be feeling shocked or impressed.
“Oh Lyuu,” Leila giggled. “Rockbirds are amongst the weakest of the monsters our Lord captured for the sake of today’s picnic.”Leila looked towards the sandwiches and rice balls laid out at the centre of the picnic mat as she spoke.The more composed of the two maids had assisted me in making today’s lunch. In fact, she helped me with everything besides procuring the ingredients, so she knew exactly what was in each and every single item we were serving. I was all hyped up for the picnic, so I’d gone all out and hunted down some monster meat as opposed to just lazily purchasing all the ingredients with dungeon points.“Y’know what, Leila? I’m not even gonna ask. All that matters to lil’ old me is that it’s delicious. I’mma even say that deliciousness is righteousness. The end justifies the means, as long as it’s delicious.”
“‘Tis not a bad mentality to have,” nodded Lefi. “But this meal of ours is still lacking in flavour, I say. It falls the slightest bit short of my standard. I believe a few finishing touches are in order.”
“Yes, Lefi, I know. There will be dessert, and lots of it.”
“Yay! I can’t wait!” shouted Illuna.
“You sure know how to please a gal, Master. Your sweets are so good they always make me wanna stuff my face.”
“Excellent.”Illuna, Lyuu, and Lefi all cheered in their own respective ways as they realized that they’d get to finish the meal off with sweets. Leila remained silent, but only because she’d already known ahead of time.“The world is vast,” said Lefi. “That, however, means not that you could enjoy sweet foods of such caliber at any other location. Rejoice, Lyuu, and be grateful that you are here.”
“Wait, why the hell are you getting all cocky? It’s not like you’re the one making them.”
“Listen well, Yuki. It matters not the identity of the individual that crafted these sweets. My ability to evaluate the quality of a sweet food is predicated upon unparalleled experience. And thus, the weight of my word is unrivaled. I know better than any other what it means for a sweet to be delicious. The value of my acknowledgement far surpasses any justification wrought by their origin.”
“Mhmmm, yeah. I’m sooooo happy the ‘allmighty’ supreme dragon acknowledges the sweets I produce.” I rolled my eyes.
“Excellent. Know that feeling well and ingrain it into your heart. For that is precisely the emotion you should bear should your gaze fall upon me.”Apparently not catching my sarcasm, Lefi smiled triumphantly.“Oh… Right, Master. I’ve been meanin’ to ask. Why d’you keep callin’ Lefi the Supreme Dragon?”
“I could’ve sworn I told you that she was the real deal.”
“No uh… this is my first time hearin’ it, Master. Wait, wait, are you really bein’ serious!?”
“Yeah. That right there is the strongest ancient dragon, the supreme dragon. I guess you don’t believe me though, huh?”
“W-Well, I mean, y’know… that ain’t the type of thing that I can just kinda nod along to. The Supreme Dragon’s somethin’ straight out of a legend, ain’t it? I just can’t really see Lefi bein’ it, since, you know, she’s really small and never cares about anything but sugary snacks. And she always starts throwing a fit whenever anyone beats ‘er at somethin’ too.”Lyuu had a point, and a pretty damned good one at that. If I didn’t know Lefi was the supreme dragon, I would likely assume that she was some sort of squirrel or chipmunk given the frequency with which she stuffed her cheeks with as much food as they could possibly hold.“What was that, Lyuu? I would very much like for you to repeat your words.”
“I-it ain’t nothin’! T-The only reason I didn’t think you were the supreme dragon was ‘cause I didn’t think the supreme dragon’d be such a beaut!”
“Oh? Tell me, how exactly did you think a Supreme Dragon would look?” said Lefi, menacingly.
“Er, I, um… uh…”Lyuu’s face rapidly paled as she stuttered over and over.“Stop that. You’re terrifying her, you idiot.”Lefi was going overboard, so I scolded her and gave her head a light chop.“Ow…! For what reason are you hitting me? It is not as if I was at fault. Lyuu was—”
“Stop trying to shift the blame. Think about your habits and how you present yourself. You really don’t have the right to complain.”
“…”Lefi glared at me reproachfully, but I didn’t really care. I stared right back and refused to yield.“T-Thanks Master, I owe you one. Wait, Leila, you’ve been awfully calm this whole time. Didja already know or somethin’?”
“I did. It is a well known fact that the Wicked Forest’s depths are the Supreme Dragon’s territory. I recall that she had many a dragon under her command when we first met her. If anything, I am more surprised that you were unaware of her identity.”
“T-There’s no way I coulda noticed it back then! Things were just happenin’ way too fast. And then Fluffrir showed up, so I like, you know, kinda stopped paying attention to everythin’ else…”Speaking of Rir, he and Shii were both currently resting in the shade of a nearby tree. I could tell that Shii had already drifted off to sleep, but the same couldn’t be said for the fenrir. His eyes were closed, but his ears had very obviously twitched when Lyuu mentioned his name. It seemed that he was only pretending to be asleep so that we could enjoy ourselves without having to accommodate for him.Wow, he’s really considerate.“You guys are talking too much! Let’s all finish eating so we can get back to having fun! I really wanna play badminton again!”
“Good idea, Illuna. Badminton sounds pretty good right about now.”
“Yay! Then let’s play together!”Illuna broke out into an adorable smile.“By the way, Master. Is Illuna anythin’ like Lefi, or?”
“Nah. She’s just a normal little girl.”
“That… makes her kinda amazin’ in her own way, dontcha think? It ain’t everyday that you have both the Supreme Dragon and a Demon Lord pamperin’ the same gal. Y’know, it almost feels to me like she’s got even more influence than the two of you seein’ as how her words could prob’ly sway your choices real easy.”Lyuu was right; I totally agreed.If I had to organise the dungeon’s hierarchy as any sensible Japanese man would, then I’d likely create a system featuring an Elite Four. Illuna would undoubtedly be the most important, and therefore the most powerful. She’d be followed by Lefi, Rir, and then finally myself in that order.[2]The tropes dictated that I, as the weakest and least influential of the Elite Four, would be forced to take on the task of dealing with intruders. More specifically, my role would be engage the intruders in combat, lose, and then tell them not to get cocky just because they defeated me, and that three greater challenges awaited them.Okay uh, no. What if I subverted the trope a bit? The tropes also dictated that the weakest member of the Elite Four would die immediately after relaying the aforementioned information to the enemy, and I wasn’t particularly keen on losing my life. I would much rather emerge victorious and state that the challenger in question wasn’t qualified to face any of the others.Yeah, that sounds way better. Wait, if I’m in charge of driving away people, then I guess I would probably deserve a fancy title to go along with my role, huh? What if I called myself the dungeon’s shield? Actually, yeah, that sounds pretty good. Heh. I could totally be like, “I am Yuki, the fearsome Demon Lord that rules this dungeon and serves as its aegis!”“Huh? What was that for all of a sudden?”
“Nothing. Nothing at all.”Oh crap, I totally said that out loud.And so, the outing continued. We made noise, played games, and fooled around until Illuna ran out of energy and started drifting off to dreamland.***[1] A Japanese fried chicken whose flavour is meatier than the fried chicken I’ve had in the states. Well made karaage is juicy. Note that it doesn’t actually necessarily have to be chicken, or even bird. It just *typically* is.[2] The Elite Four, also known as the Four Heavenly Kings, is an overused Japanese trope seen in all sorts of media. The Elite Four is often ranked, with the 1st seat being the strongest, and the 4th seat being the weakest. The Elite Four almost always belongs to an enemy organisation, and the player or main character is required to tackle them one by one, from weakest to strongest, though this is not necessarily always the case. Their origin lies in buddhist mythology; each of the Elite Four is supposed to be a protector of one of the cardinal directions.Popular examples include: The Pokemon League. Toriko and the buddies he grew up with. The negacommanders in Sailor Moon. The four douchebags in Kill La Kill. Etc, etc.<– Prev — Next –>

The Kingdom Of AllysiaThe Kingdom of Allysia was famous. Despite being located in the continent’s northwestern corner, it was considered a central hub in which merchants and scholars gathered from all over the realm. The kingdom’s prosperity was brought about by its abundant human resources. It possessed more people than any of the surrounding nations, and as such, was able to better assign individuals to roles befitting their talents. The country’s economy was more developed than any of those in its vicinity, and, of course, its people saw the benefits.And that was only the tip of the iceberg. The Allysians were indeed proud of their robust economy, but they were even more proud of the state of their technology. The magically enhanced items and tools produced in Allysia were often a full generation ahead of what could be found elsewhere. It went without saying that their advancements were not limited to devices for the masses. Their military tools had also been subject to innovation.The might of the Allysians was no secret. Allysian flags and soldiers could be found amongst those leading charges against demi-human forces more often than not.The man that sat at this mighty nation’s forefront, its current monarch, was King Reiyd Glorio Allysia. King Reiyd had yet to achieve anything revolutionary. He wasn’t known for his prowess in combat; Reiyd was not the type of king that could break though an enemy army and fell a general with his own two hands.However, he was regarded as a splendid ruler nonetheless. His policies brought the country stability, and as such, his people considered him reliable.“I implore you to reconsider, your majesty! We must take action! The time has come!”Said king was currently entertaining a visitor in the throne room. The younger man attempting to persuade him was none other than his son, Riutt Glorio Allysia.Reiyd believed that his son had developed into a fine young man. The prince loved his country and always worked hard to serve it. Alas, Riutt was still young. He failed to understand that his passion could sometimes be misdirected—“My son, I understand your concerns, but I will not allow you to act.”—And that this was precisely one of those times.“So you want me to sit by, twiddle my thumbs, and watch!? Our country was just subject to an invasion!” raged Riutt. He was practically shouting at the top of his lungs.The king knew the cause of his son’s anger. The messenger that had arrived just a few days prior had informed them both that Alfyro, a city near one of the country’s borders, had been temporarily occupied by an army of monsters.“The assault, or invasion, as you call it, was insignificant. The situation has already resolved itself. The only individuals harmed were criminals. I see no reason for us to deploy our soldiers,” said the king. Unlike his son, he was able to remain calm as he made his verdict.It wasn’t as if the king hadn’t considered retaliation. Rather, he was refusing his son precisely because he had already considered it. In the king’s eyes, picking a fight with the invaders wasn’t worth it given their point of origin. But much to the king’s dismay, his son did not share his judgement.“The amount of harm caused is irrelevant. What matters is that our country’s borders were breached by a foreign force!”Listening to his father’s conclusion had only caused Riutt to become even more passionate.Riutt firmly believed that retaliating and assaulting the enemy with a counter-invasion was the best choice to make. He was concerned that the monsters would return and attack the city once more if they did not immediately demonstrate the extent of their power.Another reason the prince wished to launch an assault was that he was simply angry. One of the towns in his beloved country had been damaged by mindless monsters, mere animals without the ability to reason.But in truth, both of those reasons were mere pretenses, excuses.The truth of the matter was that the prince wanted to expand his country’s borders. The monsters that invaded Alfyro had come from the Wicked Forest. All of the countries bordering the Wicked Forest had classified it as too dangerous to conquer.In other words, it was untouched, prime real estate, yet to be claimed—a literal mountain of treasure.And Prince Riutt desperately desired it. Annexing the Wicked Forest would, without a doubt, strengthen his nation. But his father, the king, was too afraid of the Supreme Dragon to conquer it. In Ruitt’s eyes, his father’s fear was unfounded. The Supreme Dragon was supposed to have settled down in the Wicked Forest’s depths hundreds of years ago. The prince knew the legends, but he doubted that the dragon had remained. At the very least, it had not been sighted in recent times.He knew that the monsters that made the forest their home were powerful, but so were the enchanted items and weapons at his disposal. He knew that his forces could deal with them, that they had a good shot at making the Wicked Forest their own.In other words, the Prince believed that the only thing preventing Allysia from annexing the Wicked Forest was his father’s cowardice.“You are only saying that because you have failed to grasp the Wicked Forest’s nature,” said the king, with a sigh.
“I know it, and I know it well. It is but another uncharted region teeming with dangerous monsters.”
“You would not wish to challenge it if you truly understood it.”The father frowned as he gazed upon his stupid, stubborn excuse of a son, his eyes filled with disappointment.An expression that Riutt simply could not tolerate.“I do not care what you say, Riutt. I will not permit you to send our forces to the forest. That is a royal decree.”
“…Fine.” Ruitt clenched his teeth. “I will refrain from it for the time being.”The prince turned around and violently burst out of the throne room in a fit of rage before lumbering down the royal palace’s elaborate hallway.He didn’t even bother trying to hide his displeasure. It was clear that anyone that approached him as he was now was prone to incurring his wrath. Despite that, another man soon scurried to his side.“What now, Your Highness? His Majesty’s royal decree makes it quite difficult for us to play our hand.”
“His Majesty knows nothing of our plans, and he will continue to know nothing of our plans,” said Riutt, bitterly.
“So proceed as planned?”
“Yes. Rally the troops.”
“By your will.”The man left the prince’s side in order to attend to his duties.With no one to accompany him, and no destination in mind, the prince stopped walking and turned towards one of the castle’s many ornate decorations.Though he was staring the decoration down, it failed to be reflected in his eyes, as his gaze was filled with naught but the light of a passionate, uncontrollable ambition.***The clattering of footsteps and clanging of metal echoed throughout the Wicked Forest as a group of armoured, disciplined men trudged their way through it.They were moving in formation, but the group as a whole still seemed a bit awkward and unnatural. In a sense, one could say that it was only to be expected. Though all the individuals present had gathered under the prince’s banner, they weren’t truly a unified division. They were merely cooperating with one another in order to get the job done.Most of the troops were soldiers employed by Allysian nobles. They were all technically a part of the same, overarching organisation, but they’d never actually met each other prior to embarking on the expedition. They all served different masters; each group worked at a slightly different pace. Naturally, they were only here to further their employers’ interests. The nobles had sent them to the prince’s aid in hopes that he would provide them with a piece of the territory he had set out to claim.“Ugh. I hate this. Why the hell are we all the way out here?” groaned one of the soldiers.
“Chin up man. I know how you feel. This place is dangerous as all hell, but they be payin’ us real good for the job, don’t they? Besides, we’ve got a good number of experienced veteran fighters with us, alongside the newest gear, so it ain’t all bad.“
“Yeah, we made a killin’.”The two men that replied to the soldier’s complaints were mercenaries. Like everyone else present, they were also selected for the job by someone that wanted to get on the prince’s good side. Mercenaries would typically act like bandits in times of peace, so many of the actual soldiers detested the men, but they did at least acknowledge their strength.“Besides, heard some demon or demi or something kidnapped a bunch of demi girls. If things go well, we could get a taste of those girls ourselves.”
“Hehehe, demis? I like me the sound of that. Guess I better work hard.”
“You won’t last if you start getting all excited now, you limpdick.”
“Heh, no worries there, bro. My boy down there can stay hard longer than a rockbird.”The men continued to engage in the vilest of conversations as they moved—an act only made possible because they had yet to learn that they were marching straight into the gates of hell.<– Prev — Next –>

The Invasion
It was night time. Illuna was asleep and the maids had already returned to their room. Lefi and I were bored. We didn’t really have anything better to do, so we had started playing board games.That was when it happened.“What the!?”I reacted with a jolt as my menu system suddenly activated and pulled up a map of the dungeon.“Whatever is the matter, Yuki?”
“It looks like there are some uninvited guests headed our way.”
“Intruders?”
“Yeah,” I frowned.There were two scenarios in which my map would open on its own accord. The first was when something hostile got too close to the dungeon core. The second was when the dungeon’s territories were invaded by anything that generated more than a certain number of Dungeon Points. The amount of Dungeon Points something was worth was directly proportional to how powerful that something was, so in essence, both cases served to indicate that the dungeon was in danger.One of the warning system’s most interesting features was that it was flexible. It could trigger based off both individual enemies and groups of enemies. That is, it could still activate even if we were invaded by a large party comprised of weaker entities so long as the sum of all their individual Dungeon Point values exceeded a certain threshold.And this time, that was precisely the case. My territory had been invaded by a swarm of weaklings.The only reason I was capable of discerning that the individual invaders were weak was because my map had recently undergone an upgrade. It was now capable of showing me detailed information about each invader, with one of these details being the trespassers’ races. This time, they were all human. There looked to be about four to five hundred of them in total.“Have you any knowledge of their identities?” asked Lefi.
“Well, they’re all wearing similar equipment, so they probably belong to an army.”
“Oh?”
“Remember how we attacked some human town in order to get Illuna back? I’m pretty sure the country that town’s affiliated with dispatched their troops because they weren’t happy with what we did.”
“So the fools failed to learn their lesson?”
“Pretty much, yeah.”
“Shall I destroy them?”A cold, dark smile made its way across Lefi’s face. The humans knew that she ruled the Wicked Forest’s deepest parts. Their invasion demonstrated that they no longer respected her authority. And that, she would not stand for.Lefi was capable of resolving the situation with ease. In fact, letting her loose would have been the most efficient way of dealing with our “guests.” But still, I shook my head and rejected the offer.“Nah,” I smiled. “I’d rather not have to rely on you if possible. This is my dungeon, defending it and everyone that lives in it is my responsibility. Besides, this is the perfect opportunity for me to try something I’ve been meaning to test.”I had already known that this was going to happen.The city’s governor was willing to comply with our demands. It was clear that he understood our power and didn’t want to challenge us. There was, however, no guarantee that his country would feel the same. As far as they were concerned, we were in the wrong. We had crossed their borders, threatened their citizens, and even occupied one of their towns.I was certain that some hot-headed higher up would ignore all the governor’s warnings and send troops at us for the sake of retaliation. There was no way that mentioning the Supreme Dragon would be enough to pacify all the idiotic patriots at the country’s helm.They were sure to challenge her; they were doomed to repeat their predecessors’ mistakes.But in essence, that was precisely what it meant to be human.My knowledge of my old world’s history was enough to inform me that, for humans, forgetting the past was normal. Humanity had always continued to make the same mistakes over and over. The lessons our ancestors left us would always fade with time and be left forgotten in the annals of history.It was precisely that bit of knowledge that led me to expect this invasion. And since I expected it, I was ready for it.I’d been expanding the amount of territory covered by the dungeon at almost every given opportunity. I had already integrated a fair part of the forest into my domain. My plan was to have the invaders assist me in testing out two of the dungeon features that I wished to further explore.The first of these features was setting traps through the dungeon’s interface. I had already used the function to prepare everything ahead of time, so I knew how it worked. However, I had no clue how effective the traps were. I needed to see them in action. The second feature was altering the lay of the land that I had acquired through the expansion of my domain.I took a deep breath and stopped thinking about the dungeon as I took turns glancing at Lefi, who was staring straight at me, and Illuna, who was still asleep.My second life was… an enjoyable one. I spent most of my time effectively doing whatever I wanted. I could waste days just messing around without having to face the consequences.I never ended up finding myself wanting to be human again. I never once yearned to be a part of human society. Nor had I ever wished that I was still back in Japan.And it was all thanks to them.Lefi and Illuna were why my days had always been so filled with joy. I was certain that I would have longed for my homeland had they not been there for me.That was why I had no mercy to show for those that threatened them, for those that threatened to take away the happy days I spent with them by my side.If the soldiers were our enemies, I would destroy them. No questions asked.“But, I guess I’ll at least issue them a warning first.”I was prepared to do whatever it took to protect my dungeon and its inhabitants. But I too had once been human. I couldn’t help but feel a slight tinge of lingering compassion for the intruders that I had once shared a race with. So I decided that I would at least offer them an opportunity to leave.“Hey Lefi…?”I got up and materialized my wings as I began to speak.“What is it, Yuki?”She spoke in her usual, casual tone—“I’m going to step out for a bit. Could you do me a favour watch over the dungeon for me while I’m away?”
“Very well,” she nodded. “I… will await your return.”—Or at least she tried.“Be quick about it. The next turn is yours, and I fear my impatience may drive me to make your move for you should you not return at once.”Her voice wavered and conveyed to me the subtle emotions behind the words she’d chosen not to say.Thank you, Lefi.“I swear, you better not.”I smiled wryly and did my best to stop my emotions from surfacing as I left the throne room and readied myself to confront the intruders.***Translator’s note: This is the first time I’ve ever experienced not being good enough at English to translate something properly. For that, I guess I need to apologize to the readers, the author, and the novel itself. I can’t do this scene justice. I tried to convey all the subtle emotions it’s filled with, but I don’t think I got them across very successfully.Long story short, Lefi is both aware that Yuki is taking a risk. He is placing himself in danger of either dying or suffering psychological damage after the conflict. Both are trying to speak to each other in such a way that provides the other party with peace of mind. Lefi understands that this is something Yuki has resolved himself to do, and knows that he needs to do it himself. This is why she never once directly tells him she is concerned for his safety. She doesn’t want him to be worried about her being worried about him. The lines at the end reek of subtle romantic feelings, but I can’t get them quite right, even after staring at them for like 12 hours.Tl;dr. Sorry I’m bad at English.<– Prev — Next –>

A Warning Past DarkIt was the middle of the night. The army’s camp was almost dead silent. Most of the soldiers had retreated to one of the many tents laid out atop the forest’s floor and gone to sleep. But of course, not all of them had the liberty to retire for the night immediately. Some were tasked with the duty of staying awake and ensuring that the army would not be caught off guard by an emergency. About half of these soldiers were up and about, wandering the campgrounds, while the other half cuddled around a campfire and waited the night away.Checking the map, I realized that there weren’t any monsters in the camp’s immediate vicinity. There were several sitting off in the distance, observing it from afar, but they dared not approach. The humans were likely using some sort of magical device to deter them. I had no doubts that the technology for it existed. The slave trader we’d taken Illuna back from had used something similar on Rir.Though I knew the camp was guarded, I made no attempt at sneaking around. I simply waltzed right through it without a care in the world. Stealth, one of my higher level skills, allowed me to turn invisible, so there was no need for me to be cautious. Unfortunately, the skill’s invisibility wasn’t perfect. It’s effectiveness varied drastically based on how powerful I was compared to whatever was trying to perceive me. The guards, however, were pitifully weak. They couldn’t hold a candle to me, so none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary even when I walked right past them.I found myself in front of the largest, fanciest tent after a minute or two of wandering around.Looks like this is probably the commander’s tent.I gave it a quick once over in order to confirm I had the right place before nonchalantly stepping inside.“Who’s there…!?”The man within got up from his bed and grabbed the sword he left by his bedside the moment I entered his tent. His voice was gruff and he spoke in a low, cautioned tone.“Oh? It appears that you are able to perceive me.”The man standing before me was strong. His level was far higher than that of any other soldiers present. But still, he was only human. His stats were inferior to those of the monsters that populated the forest. I was certain that rockbirds and other similar monsters would be able to crush him with ease.His skill list contained many entries that bolstered his ability to organise his troops and take command. He was evidently skilled in logistics, and likely the army’s commander.I was going to need to reveal myself if I wanted to talk to him, so I undid my invisibility. I made sure to do it gradually so that he wouldn’t overreact and attack me out of sheer anxiety.“What th—”
“Be silent unless you wish for me to immediately deprive you of your life.”I loosed a wave of bloodlust-drenched magical energy in order to intimidate the man, a technique I learned back when I had assaulted the slave trader. All I had to do to activate it was focus on wanting to kill while gathering my magic before releasing the built up energy into my surroundings.Almost all of this world’s creatures had the ability to sense magic, so the method I’d come up with was extremely effective when it came to expressing my intent to kill. Like Stealth, channeling my raw bloodlust would affect my enemies more or less based on our relative power levels. Individuals stronger than me would shrug it off without a care in the world, but individuals equal to or weaker than me would be subject to intense pressure. It would often make them panic and perhaps even falter when attempting to launch an attack. Creatures that were too much weaker than me would instantly faint upon exposure.The man’s reaction to my bloodlust evidenced that he was much stronger than your average Joe; he had managed to remain conscious. However, that wasn’t to say he hadn’t felt its effects. He’d immediately broken out into a cold sweat. But that wasn’t all. The sheer extent of the fear he experienced had caused him to obey my order and instantly shut his mouth.“Are you the pathetic whelp in charge of this army?”I spoke to him in a condescending tone. I’d determined that it was necessary for me to speak in a way that befitted my Demon Lord title else risk having the enemy make light of me.“N-No, I’m not.” He stumbled over his words. It sounded like he’d only barely managed to bring himself to speak.Wait, what?“And that is the truth?”
“I swear it.”The soldier was clearly still on guard, but I didn’t think he was lying. He just didn’t to have the composure required to do so.The fuck!? Seriously? Is he really not the guy in charge here? Oh god, this is embarrassing… I just totally walked in on him and confidently assumed that he was the guy running the place. Ugh… I feel like a fucking moron. What kind of retard assumes the strongest fighter is also always the one in charge? That’d be an awful way to manage things. God. I’m so fucking retarded I should just find myself a hole so I can curl up in it and die.I felt an overwhelming urge to hide myself in a corner somewhere, but somehow managed to fight it off.Okay, Yuki, that’s enough of that. Pull yourself together. You have business to attend to.Thinking things through a bit more, I realized that I wasn’t entirely wrong. His tent and skill indicated that he had influence. There was simply no way he wasn’t among the brass.“Oh? But are you not the strongest member of this ‘army?’”
“…They put someone else in charge.” The man grimaced as he spoke.He clearly wasn’t happy. If I were to guess, I’d assume that the individual commanding the group was likely some noble that had the position presented to them on a silver platter, despite not deserving it. That said, I didn’t care enough to pry.“If that is the case, then relay my message to your superior, word for word.”
“…Alright.”Though hesitant, the man nodded. He was an excellent soldier. Though he didn’t have the Analysis skill, he could still discern that he was much weaker than me, so he remained obedient as opposed to trying something stupid. Moreover, he was constantly looking around and analyzing his surroundings in hopes of finding something that would assist in him in turning the tides in his favour as he engaged me in conversation.“Then listen well. You have already entered my territory. If you dare advance further, then I will slay each and every single one of you without mercy or exception. I care not for your purposes. If you wish to live, then turn tail and leave this place at once.”The man’s eyes stopped skittering around the room and focused on me. It seemed like he wanted to ask me something, but was unsure if it would incur my wrath.“You may speak.”He swallowed his saliva before raising his voice.“I would like to ask you just one question.”
“I shall allow it.”
“Why would someone as strong as you bother issuing us a warning? Why not just wipe us all out?”I grinned as would a psychotic villain before answering him.“Have you not the sense to discern the obvious? It is because eliminating your excuse for an army would be a nuisance.”
“A… nuisance…?”
“I care little for you and your people. I have no interest in your affairs. I have merely decided that I will allow you to leave should you abide by my decree, and that I will crush you if you oppose it. I suppose you have grasped this much, at the very least?”The man nodded, so I continued.“Then, I ask you this. Would you not find it a nuisance to crush each and every single ant that strays into your domain? It is easy to bring about their end, but requires a far greater time investment than it otherwise deserves. That is how I feel about you. Stamping out your lives is no difficult task, but I do not wish to waste my time.”
“A-Are you saying that humans are no different from ants!?”
“Precisely. The differences between your species are so miniscule that I find myself unconsciously placing you in the same category.”Despite my claims, I didn’t actually think that humans and ants were the same. Ants were much more terrifying. The Wicked Forest’s ants were the toughest enemies I’ve faced to date. They had scared me shitless with their tenacity. I still felt traumatized by them even now.“That is all I have to say. I shall provide you a short period of grace. Leave and continue to live, or stay and perish. The choice is yours.”I activated Stealth once again as I left the tent. It was a simple process on my end, but to him, it’d almost appeared as if I’d vanished into the night itself.<– Prev — Next –>

A Demonstration of the Dungeon’s Features“…Yeah, I figured it wouldn’t go as well as I hoped.”I quietly grumbled as I used the dungeon’s UI to watch the man I had just threatened. He had heeded my warning and done exactly as I asked. That is, he dashed straight out of his tent the moment I left and immediately sought an audience with the army’s commander. He attempted to explain the situation and persuade his boss that they were in great peril, but the commander didn’t believe him.The man I spoke to was the only one that saw me, so everyone else assumed that he had either had a nightmare or simply lost his mind. Despite being belittled by those around him, he didn’t falter or doubt his own judgement. He promptly roused his unit and led it out of the forest.A wise choice.Unlike his colleagues, he had made the choice to both live and save the lives of his men.“Uhhmmm…”
“Yes, Lefi?”
“Answer me this, Yuki. Why have you already returned, and why do you appear so unfazed…?”The Supreme Dragon’s voice was filled with a sort of hesitant confusion.“Well, all I did was issue a threat, so…”
“Tell me that before you leave next time…”Lefi began to blush as she pouted in displeasure.“I not only roused your spirits as I saw you off, but also convinced myself that I would need to refrain from sleeping until you returned. I feel like a fool, and it is all your fault.”I couldn’t help but think that her reaction was cute.“Yeah, my bad. Here, how about I make it up to you by showing you something you’ll probably find interesting.”I fiddled around with the dungeon’s UI as I spoke and changed my map’s display settings so that she could see it. The dungeon still treated Lefi like an invader. But in spite of that, I’d gained the ability to show her the dungeon’s UI at will. To be honest, I still didn’t understand exactly how the dungeon gauged whether or not it was okay for someone to see its display, but if I had to guess, then I’d say it probably had something to do with trust.I used the map to open up a seperate window and directed her attention towards it.“So these are the intruders?”
“Yeah, they’re the idiots that thought invading our territory was a bright idea.”Reflected in the display was a real time image of the campground I’d just returned from. The man I’d spoken to was gone, and all those under his command had left with him, but for the most part, it’d been exactly as it was when I’d first arrived. It was still littered with sleepy looking soldiers tottering about as they waited for their night shifts to end.The reason we were able to view the campsite from the throne room was because I had scattered evil eyes, nifty little monsters I could spawn through the dungeon’s systems, all around the area prior to returning. Evil eyes looked like baseball sized eyes that’d sprouted wings. Though they were technically monsters, they weren’t meant for combat; their only ability was to forward what they saw back to the dungeon’s display. In other words, they were more or less just wireless cameras.As they were inorganic and basically a type of golem, they didn’t need any sustenance. They could function so long as the dungeon supplied them with its magical energy, which meant that they would cease to work if they were taken out of the dungeon’s territory. But as far as I was concerned, that weakness of theirs was irrelevant. I wasn’t planning to leave the dungeon, so there wasn’t much of a point in me having eyes outside my own territory.I had to admit that I did, at some point, feel that I wanted to tour the world. But actually doing so simply wasn’t a viable choice, as I would have to leave the dungeon core, which was more or less my heart, behind.I had already cautioned the army against remaining in my domain, and my message had without a doubt, been relayed to their leader. In other words, all those that were still present had chosen to oppose me even though I’d kindly gone out of my way to tell them that I wanted them to leave. Their goal might not have been to attack us, but I didn’t care. There were, by all means, unauthorized trespassers. And armed ones at that. I was clearly right to attack them.Woo, free lab rats! Er, I mean, time for legitimate self defense!***“Huh? What the hell? When’d it suddenly get all bright out?”One of the guards on night duty raised a hand to his brow as if he was trying to block the sun out of his eyes as he voiced a confused mutter.“Ha!” The guard beside him chuckled. “Looks like the lack of rest has started gettin’ to ya. It’s still somewhere around midni—”The soldier never got to finish his sentence. He’d been silenced by a third guard, who’d impaled him straight through the heart from behind.“W-We’re under attack! They have us surrounded!”The man who’s sword was now stained in crimson screamed at the top of his lungs as he ripped his blade out from his ally’s corpse. He then turned around and began swinging his sword at the air in a panic. He continued to strike and dodge, as if he were really engaged in combat.And he wasn’t the only one.He and many of the other guards on night duty had completely failed to realize that they were no longer perceiving the same sounds and sights as their allies.They’d all completely lost their minds.Noise began permeating its way through the camp as an increasing number of guards began succumbing to madness.Those resting in their tents soon began to stir. They got up and lit their torches as they attempted to identify the source of the commotion.“What the fuck is going on here!?The army’s commander emerged from his quarters and shouted in confusion. A single glance at him was enough to tell that he had obtained his position through the use of political means. He was morbidly obese and lacked the air carried by those experienced in military affairs.“I’m not sure sire! It appears that all the men are saying different thi—”The man collapsed before he could finish his report. His head, which’d been severed cleanly from his neck, fell from his corpse and rolled to the commander’s feet.“W-What the!?”“ENENENENENEMMIIIIMIMIIIIIIIIEEEEEESSS!”Behind the now headless soldier stood what appeared to be another allied soldier. His mouth was hanging half open, with drool leaking out the sides. His blade was covered with human blood and fat.He was clearly deranged.“O-Oi! Stop! Don’t get any closer!” The commander attempted to issue the man an order, but he continued to advance as opposed to heeding it. ”Stop him! S-Someone stop that man at once!”Fortunately for the commander, not all the soldiers had gone totally mad. Several individuals that still had their wits about them seized the man that had lost his ability to reason and pinned him to the ground.“Just what the hell is going on here!?”Again, the commander shouted in confusion as he looked about the campsite.Or rather, the degenerated mess it had become.***“Oh…? So you made use of the tree of delusion?”Lefi made an idle comment as she observed the campsite remotely. The tone of her voice indicated that the results of my work had served to pique her interest.“Yeah. I’m surprised you know about them.”
“Of course I do.”I was genuinely impressed that Lefi had recognized the cause of the soldier’s madness just by seeing the state they’d ended up in.She’d immediately caught onto the fact that I’d used the rauschgift balm, also known as the tree of delusion. Rauschgift balms had the ability to cause creatures that remained in their vicinity to go mad.They did this by releasing their magical energies. Nearby entities would automatically absorb this energy and lose their minds once too much of it accumulated within their bodies. The exact delusions shown differed greatly between individuals. Monsters were highly sensitive to magical energies, so they would immediately realize that they shouldn’t stay near the trees. Humans, however, lacked the senses to make such a judgement.That was why I’d chosen to use the dungeon’s systems to spawn them throughout my territory. They weren’t native to the area, but the dungeon had made it so that they could thrive regardless. As they’d been created by the dungeon, they were also completely under its control, which meant I could turn their magic-emitting functions on and off at any time, from anywhere.This time around, I’d activated the trees from the throne room after confirming that the army’s commander had chosen not to heed my warning.Both Lefi and I were immune to the rauschgift balms’ effects. The two of us simply had too much magical energy. Any external magics we took in would end up getting mixed in with our much denser mana and be rendered ineffective. I’d always thought that it would be the opposite. My body was made up of the magical particles that magic was based off of, so I’d always assumed that I would be incredibly susceptible to having my magical energies disrupted, but I was wrong.I’d once even nervously tried standing by the magical trees while holding onto a high grade potion just in case, only to find that it had absolutely no effect on me whatsoever. My mana was just that dense.“It does not appear that you will be able to exterminate them with only the trees’ effects,” said Lefi.
“Well duh. I’ve still got more in store for them. Come on, shouldn’t you already know how much of a genius I am?”
“I do hope that you aware that those who label themselves geniuses are more often than not the exact opposite.”
“Alright, fine. Let’s put this way.” I grinned mischievously. “I’m at least smart enough to kick your ass every single time we play any board game. You’ve literally never beat me.”
“T-That is only because we were playing games in which you happened to be more skilled! And more importantly, we failed to complete the last game we played. The outcome has yet to be decided, and I know it that I will emerge victorious. Listen well, Yuki, the status quo shall soon change! I will crush you in a battle of wits! Let us play immediately and settle the score!”Lefi promptly challenged me out of sheer indignance, her face bright red once more.“Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. Just let me finish this up first, okay?”I dropped the palm of my hand on her head and lightly stroked her hair as I smiled and activated the next trap I had in store.<– Prev — Next –>

Tower Defense Games Are Fun!“Follow me! The magical energy’s thinner over here!”It took awhile, but the humans eventually realized that a strange magic was in the air. One of their members, a man that looked to be a mage, had identified it as the source of the madness afflicting the army’s members, and had started leading his allies away from it. For a human, his ability to sense magical energy was outstanding.A slight bit of order had finally been restored because he had brought a large group of soldiers to an area where the delusion-inducing spell was less potent. His commands were the reason the complete and utter chaos had finally started to abate. A brief whistling noise rang through the man’s ears as he turned to face the men he had rallied, but he paid it no mind. The sound had only lasted for a fraction of a second, so he had unconsciously assumed it to be unimportant.“S-Sir, y-you…”The footsoldier right in front of him, however, did not. He was clearly panicking, but he still managed to stammer out a few words and get the mage’s attention.“What?”The mage shifted his body slightly to look the man who’d addressed him, only to find him frozen in shock with his finger pointed straight at the mage’s center of mass. Since the other man seemed unable to speak, the mage decided to follow his line of sight; he looked straight down at his own body.“H-Huh?”The sight he was greeted with was an unfamiliar one.His gut was gone. Everything between his stomach and his solar plexus had instead been replaced by a large, circular hole. The moment the man noticed his missing organs was the moment the light faded from his eyes. He died on the spot, unable to even feel pain.Only after he collapsed did his allies finally realize that his killer had been standing right behind him the whole time.It swayed left and right in an almost unnatural fashion as it searched for more prey.“Is that… a branch of ivy?”One of the men narrowed his eyes in confusion as he gazed upon the odd, moving plant. Its branches, dyed red with blood, still had the mage’s entrails hanging off of them. After another moment of swaying, the ivy plant lashed out once again, aiming a branch at the skull of a nearby soldier that was stuck staring in mute amazement.A dull wet sound resounded through the forest as the bloody whip of a branch shredded his skull and splattered its insides all over the undergrowth.Only then did the other soldiers finally react. They promptly turned around and made a beeline back to the campsite.“S-Shit! This place ain’t no good, there’s monsters here! We gotta find another way!”
“Fuck! Fuck!! Aren’t we supposed to have something that keeps them away!? Why isn’t it fucking working!?”
“W-Which way are we supposed to go!? How the hell are we supposed to get out of here!?”
“Oi! Stop panicking! Pull yourself together, you idiot!”With their leader gone, the soldiers found themselves reduced to a mere disorderly mob.Some tried to take leadership and rally their allies. Others pushed their fellow soldiers aside in an attempt to flee and save themselves. A third group panicked, fell into madness, and began screaming nonsensically while attacking anything and everything that fell within their reach.“W-why the hell is there a swamp here!? Shit!”A man shrieked as he accidentally fell straight into a bottomless marsh that had seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Unable to escape, he slowly sank beneath the surface and drowned in its muddy waters.“S-Someone help! Oh god, oh god it hurts! I don’t want to die!”Another man found himself in the mouth of a large, carnivorous plant. Its stomach fluids were slowly but surely digesting his body, bones and all.“Ngraaaaaaaaghhhhhh!”A third soldier was being assaulted by a large cloud of poison. It rapidly ate away at his flesh as would a strong acid.One by one, the soldiers died gruesome, miserable deaths.There was nowhere for them to run. Pain, suffering, and death awaited them at each and every single corner. The scene painted before their eyes was a veritable hellscape.“Shit! Shit shit shit shit shit! Don’t come any closer! Stay away!”The commander, who was supposed to be responsible for maintaining order and making decisions, was gasping and screaming in delirium. He was in no state to take charge. And without his instructions, the army simply had no choice but to slowly fall apart.As time passed, the number of death throes and despair-filled screams began to dwindle, slowly returning the forest’s depths to their usual silent state.And not because the soldiers had escaped.But rather, because they had been forcibly silenced.***“That went better than expected.”I put on a bit of a forced smile as I watched the scene play out on the dungeon’s display. Eliminating my enemies had been easy. They had walked straight into my traps and ended themselves, one after another. It’d almost felt like I was playing tower defense. The only difference was that my enemies had no fixed destination in mind. They instead simply wandered about until they died.Since the slaughter took place in a forest, most of my traps had been based on plants and other things that could be found in nature. I’d avoided the typical bowguns and spike traps because they were much too easy to discover in a forested environment.The best place for traps like those were caves. But that said, I didn’t place anything potentially harmful in the cave that led into the throne room. Though I was fairly certain they wouldn’t malfunction, I didn’t want to risk hurting Illuna and the maids.I also didn’t want my front door to be slathered in gore. The scenes that had just played out on my dungeon’s display were so explicit that I half expected a viewer discretion warning to periodically pop up and remind me that I was watching something children should never be allowed to see. I was grateful that the invasion had happened while Illuna was asleep. I definitely didn’t want to let her see the nausea-inducing projection before me.Personally, I wasn’t a fan of gore. I didn’t like watching it, and I wasn’t too keen on the idea of imagining it either. But because I’d just watched a massacre unfold, the sight of people getting digested by plants had been thoroughly embedded into my consciousness. I couldn’t unsee it. The imagery was so striking and vivid that I almost didn’t want to use the traps I’d just tested even though I’d gone through the trouble of verifying their practicality.“That was all it took to reduce them to mere corpses? How weak. I expected more,” said Lefi, nonchalantly. Unlike me, she hadn’t seemed to mind the gore in the slightest. Being the Supreme Dragon, she was likely totally accustomed to it. Either way, I had to admit, I respected her mental fortitude.“Well, the leader was more or less incompetent. And as I’m sure you saw, the army lacked cohesion. Their equipment was similar, but it wasn’t identical. I’m pretty sure they were just a ragtag bunch of smaller units banded together or something.”My strategy hadn’t been anything special. It was just another application of the battle-tested method known as “divide and conquer.” All I did was confuse the enemy and destroy their troops while they were split off into smaller, less organised groups.To be honest, I hadn’t thought that the massacre would go nearly as well as it did. The error in my calculations stemmed from the enemies lack of cohesion. Their disharmony had allowed me to create more confusion than anticipated, which in turn allowed me to trim down their forces with a greater degree of ease.Man, the effects of incompetence sure can be terrifying, huh? I wouldn’t have been able to finish the army off this easily had the person in charge actually used his brain. But man, that aside, dungeons sure are terrifying.Though my enemies had been incompetent, there were still about 400 of them, even after the one guy I’d threatened had taken his troops and left. And despite that, I’d eliminated the entire army with ease. Today’s experience had allowed me to understand just how much havoc a dungeon could wreak. And as a Demon Lord, learning that bit of knowledge had bolstered my confidence. Nothing else could’ve have possibly made me feel any more comfortable or empowered.In fact, I was so satisfied with the dungeon’s abilities that I’d felt the urge to give it a high five.“I must admit, I am quite impressed with your trap placement. It appears as if they have been set up exactly where they belong,” said Lefi. She finally took her eyes off the screen and directed them back towards me.
“Well, that’d just be because I knew that the humans were most likely going to be coming from the town we attacked. I placed a large number of traps in the area between it and us ahead of time and then added more after I confirmed that my suspicions had been correct.”
“Quite a logical choice, that is.” Lefi nodded. “Splendid. A new door has opened for me in the way of tactics.”I wasn’t really sure what she was going on about, so I just nodded along and let her keep talking.“I shall try implementing the strategy myself. Now, Yuki, it is time to do as you promised. Let us continue where we left off and bring a conclusion to our clash of wits.”
“Wait, you want to do it now!?”
“Of course, it would not do for us to delay it any further.”
“You do know that the sun’s about to rise in just a few hours, right?”
“Well… I have admittedly taken one too many afternoon naps lately. I am still wide awake, and I doubt I will soon begin to drowse.”God damn lazy ass “Supreme Dragon…”And so, Lefi and I decided to play a couple more games before going to sleep. Naturally, I ended up winning them all with ease.<– Prev — Next –>

Side story: Gamdia Roston

A strange tingling sensation assaulted Gamdia Roston and awoke him from his slumber.“…?”He sat up and opened his eyes, only to be assaulted by a sense of malaise before he could so much as bring his vision into focus. The atmosphere inside his tent was off. Every last hair on his body stood on end as his eyes anxiously explored his surroundings.Something was wrong; it almost felt to him like he wasn’t alone.“Who’s there…!?”Trusting his instincts, he grabbed the sword by his bedside as he voiced a question directed to the intruder.“Oh? It appears that you are able to perceive me.”It suddenly showed itself. A creature with an outline not too different from that of a human almost seemed to phase into existence before his very eyes. Its form revealed itself little by little, as if slowly seeping out of the darkness.It, or rather he, had pitch black hair, an eerie crimson eye, and dragon-like wings sprouting from his back. Gamdia was shocked, but his mind remained unfrozen. It informed him that the man that stood before him was most likely a demon, and that he perfectly matched the description of the man that had led the assault on Alfyro.“What th—”“Be silent unless you wish for me to immediately deprive you of your life.”The air that filled the tent almost seemed to become laden with weight the moment the demon opened his mouth. An incredible pressure assaulted Gamdia’s body. It was so heavy that he had to muster up every last fibre of willpower he had just to stay conscious. The dense magical energy radiating off the demon’s body slowly ate away at his spirit, but he continued to resist it. He knew for a fact that his brain would shut down the moment he lost focus.The veteran soldier broke out into a cold sweat; thick beads of perspiration dripped from his brow down to his face one after another.After confirming that Gamdia had been silenced, the demon finally began to speak.***After issuing his warning, the demon turned around and vanished into the night. The way his figure disappeared had almost made it seem as if he’d donned a cloak of shadow.Gamdia began to hyperventilate the moment the other man left. His body scrambled for deep, rapid breaths over and over again. He’d felt as if he’d held his breath through almost the entirety of the encounter. Or rather, it’d felt more like his body had simply forgotten how to breathe while in the demon’s presence.That was just how much terror the other man had inspired in him.The soldier knew that the demon was far too powerful for him to handle. In fact, he was convinced that he could have eliminated the entire army with ease, even if every last soldier attacked him at once.Continuing the expedition simply wasn’t worth it. Officially, the army had been deployed to the Wicked Forest in order to eliminate both the monsters that had attacked Alfyro and the demon that commanded them. But that was only a coverup. Their real goal was to survey the land and the many natural resources that came with it. The higher ups wanted a detailed preliminary investigation so they could move forward with their plans to claim the forest and settle it. All in order to expand the country’s borders. The subjugation was a mere pretense to silence those against the idea.Personally, Gamdia had thought the whole mission to be a bad joke from the moment he’d received it.The Wicked Forest was not to be trifled with. The monsters that lived within it were incredibly powerful. Of course, the expedition army had countermeasures. They’d been deployed with a powerful magical device that drove off any monsters in its vicinity. While many other soldiers were more than happy to rely on the technology and trust in their nation’s scientists, Gamdia was not. He knew that the whole expedition army was prone to being annihilated the moment the device failed to serve its function.Losing the army was only the least of his concerns. The Wicked Forest was known to be the Supreme Dragon’s territory. He had no doubts that the entire nation would be destroyed in the most literal sense of the word if they angered it.Despite the many risks, his nation’s higher ups had pushed the plan forward and forced him and his subordinates to go along with their recklessness.Knowing that he hadn’t the choice to refuse, Gamdia applied for a leadership role. He determined that his best course of action would be to take command of the army so that he could minimize the amount of damage dealt to his country’s forces.But the higher ups once again did not allow him to have his way. They instead delegated the position to an incompetent, foolish noble whose pockets ran much deeper than his mind.Though his city had been the one subject to the attack, Alfyro’s governor had been strongly opposed to the expedition. He vehemently refused to assist in any which way. And, having met the same demon as him, Gamdia now understood why.“I need to go talk to the stupid noble in charge and convince him to turn the army around.”Gamdia spoke to himself in an attempt to calm himself down and return his breathing to normal.He knew that suggesting a retreat would call his character to question. He would surely be branded a coward and removed from his position—but he didn’t care. He’d been against the expedition from the very start, and wished not for his countrymen to die for meaningless, political bullshit.He also knew that the noble was in it for the profit. The fool was unlikely to turn the army around regardless of what was said to him. And so, Gamdia resolved to at least take his own subordinates away and lead them to safety.With that in mind, the soldier got dressed and readied himself to seek an audience with his “superior.”<– Prev — Next –>

A Change in State“Yuki! Lefi!! Get up! It’s morning already!”A voice called out to me as I comfortably drifted in and out of sleep. Though my consciousness was hazy, I could still somehow make out the words that were being said.“Nrrggh…” I groaned.
“Come on! Hurry up and get up already!”The voice was that of a young girl’s. It was so pleasant to the ear that it almost sounded angelic.“Just give five more minutes…”
“No! You have to get up right now! Leila’s already done making breakfast!”In fact, it was so heavenly that I felt like it was slowly lulling me back to sleep.“Nrrggghhhh…”My body sudden began to jerk back and forth right as I was about to drift off to dreamland.“Come on, hurry up Yuki!”
“Okay, okay, fine. I’ll get up, so stop shaking me already.”I groaned again before opening my eyes. Illuna’s shaking had forced me awake, regardless of whether I liked it or not.Ugh… I’m still so sleepy…I groggily yawned as I raised the upper half of my body off the throne room’s floor.Wait, why’s it so warm?There was a really comfortable patch of warmth to my left, so I looked over and tried to identify it.“Oh. It was Lefi.”The dragon girl was sleeping right by my side. One of her hands had made its way toward me and grabbed ahold of my shirt. The look she had on her face could only be described as innocent. Seeing it made it hard for me to think of her as anything but a girl in her early teens.Oh yeah, she made me play with her until the crack of dawn last night.Lefi had kept losing. She got more and more indignant with every round, so she continued challenging me throughout the night. She kept playing until she was literally too tired to continue. Neither of us had had enough energy to make our way over to our beds, so we’d passed out on the spot.“Get up Lefi. It’s morning.”
“Nn…”
“Come on, wake up. It’s time to eat.”
“Just… 17 more years…”That’s an oddly specific number.“Geez! Get up already Lefi! You’re gonna miss breakfast!”Illuna realized that Lefi wasn’t listening to her, so she did to the Supreme Dragon the exact same thing she did to me. That is, she grabbed her by the shoulders and started to gently shake her back and forth.“Ugh…” Lefi groaned. “I get it, I get it already. Stop shaking me.”I couldn’t help but smile wryly at the fact that her reaction was more or less identical to my own.Once Lefi let go of my shirt, I got up and started to stretch. Sleeping on the floor had not been a good idea. My body was stiff and I hurt in all sorts of places. Worst off was my shoulder, so I started to rotate it in a wide arc in order to loosen it up.God damn it Lefi. I know you hate to lose, but can’t you at least like, get better before trying to beat me? We had to keep playing all night because you couldn’t pull off a win.“Hmmm? You’re kinda looking cooler than usual today.” Illuna curiously tilted her head as she looked at me.
“Huh? I am? Well uh… thanks, I guess. You’re looking pretty cute yourself today, Illuna.”
“Ehehe.” She giggled. “Thanks!”Illuna and I started walking towards the dining table set up in one of the throne room’s corners. Lefi was trailing a bit behind us, still half asleep. She couldn’t walk straight yet, so she kind of just ended up staggering along.Lyuu was already sitting at the table and waiting for us. At first, she and Leila had both protested the idea of joining Lefi, Illuna and I at the table because they were our “servants,” but I eventually managed to convince them otherwise. Though they were helping us with chores and stuff, I didn’t really think of them as hired housekeepers. I felt that treating them that way was just far too cold.“Mornin’ Master. And you too Lefi,” said Lyuu. “Wait, a sec. It is just me, Master, or do you kinda got this like different feel to you today?”
“Huh? I do?”
“For sure, but I dunno how I’m s’pposed to describe it. You’re just… kinda different.”I didn’t really quite get what she meant.“Good morning My Lord. Good morning Lefi.”Like Lyuu, Leila also ended up awkwardly pausing as soon as she finished greeting us.“Interesting,” she said, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. She put down the plates she’d carried out of the kitchen and, without warning, brought her face right up to my own.
“W-What’re you…”My heart rate shot up. She was so close that I couldn’t help but smell the feminine scent wafting off her body. Though I was certain she heard me, Leila didn’t answer. She instead began to circle around me and examine me from all sorts of different angles. She remained totally silent throughout; the maid didn’t start speaking again until she was looking me over.“Have you perhaps undergone a racial evolution, My Lord?”Though she’d phrased it like a question, her tone was conclusive. She seemed fairly confident that she’d hit the mark.“Huh? Racial evolution? What’s that?”Leila explained to me that monsters, demihumans, and demons would go through a sort of metamorphosis after obtaining a certain amount of experience. In other words, leveling up enough would lead an individual ascending a step up their own evolutionary chain.So it basically works the same way it does in P*kemon?Monsters were the quickest to evolve. Demihumans and demons tended to require much more experience, so they almost never evolved until they were relatively high level.With that knowledge in mind, I checked my stat page.***General Information

I was quite happy with the change, as my new class sounded much more badass. My race had switched from Archdemon to Demon Lord.But why’d this suddenly happen? Oh, wait, duh… It must’ve been been all the people I killed last night.I’d wiped out so many humans that I’d even got a title for it, but because I didn’t personally end any of their lives, I didn’t actually end up gaining any experience. My level hadn’t changed. My stats, however, had. Most of them had been boosted drastically. My MP had even shot all the way past the ten thousand mark. The only stat that didn’t change was my luck.But again, that didn’t make sense. It wasn’t me that’d done the killing. It was the dungeon.Wait! That’s it! The dungeon must’ve leveled up!Humans were weak. Their deaths barely generated any DP. The dungeon didn’t gain too much from absorbing a human’s corpse either. But that said, there’d been a whole 400 of them. Added together, the humans had provided a significant boost to my DP, as evidenced by the fact that I was currently holding on to the most I’d ever had at any given point in time.The dungeon had always been passively gaining DP because Lefi and many of the Wicked Forest’s more powerful monsters were within its bounds. The DP gained last night must have finally pushed the total over some sort of threshold and caused the dungeon to grow. And since the dungeon and I were linked, I’d grown as well.It made perfect sense.I made a mental note to check to see if the dungeon had gained any new features once I was done with my meal.“I see,” Leila nodded. “I presume that means Demon Lords evolve quickly, which likens them more to monsters than demihumans and demons. But wait, what if the demon lord was but a part of the dungeon and its systems? If I were to think along those lines, then…”Leila rambled under her breath as she looked at me as she would a lab rat.“H-Hey Leila…? The way you’re staring me down is kinda freaky.”
“Sorry, I do apologize. The phenomenon was so interesting that I forgot myself.”So she thinks I’m an interesting phenomenon…? That’s uh… discomforting. I felt as if I was starting to see a whole new side to Leila.“R-Right, no problem,” I said. “Anyway, I’m surprised you guys could tell. I didn’t even notice it myself.”“It’s because you’re you! It’s super easy to tell!” said Illuna.
“Us beastkin have got sharp senses, so it was real easy for me to notice that you were seemin’ a bit different,” added Lyuu.I looked at the full-length mirrors I had propped up nearby and quickly examined my body. I didn’t really know what they meant. I still didn’t see it.Maybe it’s just something that’s obvious to everyone but the person that it happens to.“Oh well, whatever. Nevermind that, let’s have ourselves some breakfast.”We all sat down at the table and got ready to eat, but Lefi nodded off before we actually got around to it. She’d somehow managed to retain a near perfect posture despite no longer being awake. The only thing that looked off was the position of her head, which’d dipped a bit in the forward direction.“God damn it, Lefi…” I sighed.
“Oh come on Lefi! I told you it’s time for breakfast!”Illuna promptly shook her awake yet again.“Ugh… Can I not just sleep? It is not as if we had anything planned for the day.”
“You can’t! You’ll end up getting as fat as a cow if you keep lazing around!”Seeing Lefi get scolded by a girl far younger than her brought a smile to my face. And apparently, I wasn’t the only one. Lyuu smiled wryly, while Leila allowed herself to adopt a bit of a grin.And that was how the five us began yet another average day.<– Prev — Next –>

More Changes In State“Alright, time to check if anything’s changed.”I did the usual and plopped myself down atop the throne as I opened the dungeon’s display.There weren’t any significant changes as far as the dungeon’s functions were concerned. However, I was given the option to summon new monsters, construct additional facilities, and spawn new items. In other words, my incomplete lists had been expanded on. Evidently, the dungeon really had leveled up. And chances were, it would continue to level up if it accrued enough DP.I immediately invested a wealth of DP into increasing the amount of area covered by the dungeon. The passive income I gained from the monsters wandering the Wicked Forest was nothing to scoff at, and it didn’t seem like there were any demerits to expanding my domain.“It seems that your magical energies have undergone a sort of transformation. When precisely did that happen?”Lefi curiously tilted her head as she stared at me. The dragon girl had been drifting in and out of dreamland throughout breakfast, so she’d only just noticed the change.“Last night, apparently. I guess I must’ve evolved in my sleep or something.”
“It appears so,” she nodded and seemed scrutinize me for a moment before continuing. “Interesting. I knew not that there was a Demon Lord race.”
“Really? I would’ve expected you of all people to have heard of it.”
“I rarely examine the status pages of others. I have never felt the need for it.”I could see where she was coming from. Lefi was so overwhelmingly powerful that she didn’t need to think much of those that dared to face her.“Oh yeah, Lefi. Have you ever evolved before?”
“I have not. Evolution exists in order to allow a lower life form to become more powerful by escaping the restraints placed on it by its mortal coil. My body is that of an ancient dragon, the most powerful race. As far as I know, there is nothing for me to evolve into.”Ohhh, I get it. So basically she started off as a Dr*gonite instead of needing to climb her way up from a Dr*tini.“However, that is not to say it is impossible for me to evolve. It may just be that I have not met the requirements.”
“Uhhh… Well I wouldn’t get your hopes up with your level being what it is.”
“I have been exactly as powerful as I am now for decades. It’s difficult for me to continue growing stronger. It may take another thousand years for me to make any significant progression.”A thousand years? Good god, talk about out of scale. Er, actually, not really, I guess. My lifespan’s supposed to be at least that long, so I might actually live to see it happen. If I do , I’ll make sure I throw her a huge party.“Still, I find it surprising that your appearance has remained constant despite your evolution.”
“Is it normally supposed to change or something?”
“I believe so. Monsters that have evolved typically grow fangs or horns. Those with more human-like forms, such as yourself, tend to see changes in their hair and eye colours. Of course, that is merely what is typically seen. I once encountered a demon that had tentacles and fangs protruding from his body.”Lefi’s expression warped in heartfelt disgust.“His tentacle-based attacks were slimy and disgusting. I wish to never encounter another similar individual.”I shuddered as I imagined the demon Lefi described. Thankfully, my own evolution hadn’t led me down that demon’s path. Personally, I couldn’t stand anything with too many legs. Even just looking at them was enough to freak me the hell out.Hmm… I’m not really that good with gore and stuff either. I guess I just don’t have the sort of tolerance I should. If there was a sanity stat, then mine would probably be on the lower side.After pausing to evaluate the limits of my mind, I checked my body over yet again, just to make sure I hadn’t grown any slimy tentacles. Only then did I realize that there was a part of me I’d totally forgotten to check: my wings.To be honest, I was hesitant to inspect them. I highly doubted they’d changed, and I was concerned that materializing them would also cause me to sprout additional, unwanted body parts. That said, I was going to have to check eventually. Avoiding the problem in perpetuity just wasn’t an option.And so, I reluctantly got off my throne and materialized my wings.“Wait, did I grow another set…?”My wings were the only part about me that had changed. I now had two pairs, with the second protruding from the area just under my shoulder blade.The new pair looked a bit different from the old pair. Their colour was a reddish-brown. My first impression was that I couldn’t tell whether they were bat wings or dragon wings, but either way, they didn’t look too shabby at all. In fact, they were pretty awesome. They resembled the kind of thing you’d expect to see on the devil or the grim reaper.Oh thank god I didn’t grow tentacles.I heaved a sigh of relief as I admired myself.These wings make me look kinda sinister, but I guess that’s not really a bad thing. I’m a Demon Lord, so being sinister is a status symbol. It means I’m special. [1]“You know, this isn’t actually too bad. What do you think, Lefi?”I proudly turned myself towards her, only to find her totally frozen in place.“Uh… Lefi…? Earth to Lefi, do you read me?”
“Y-Your wings are awe inspiring…”
“Uhh…what?”
“W-why ever have you been keeping those glorious wings hidden from view!?” She suddenly broke into a shout.
“Woah! C-calm down Lefi! And stop touching my wings, you’re tickling me!”I took a few steps back.“W-Why!? I’m just touching them! There is nothing wrong with that, is there? Please? Can you not just let me touch them!? I implore you!”Lefi started panting heavily as she reached towards my wings again, her cheeks dyed a deep crimson.“Stop that! At least stop wiggling your fingers! That’s just plain weird!”I grabbed her by the face and attempted to push her away.“Why are you stopping me!? What harm is there in allowing me to fondle them!?”
“It’s not about letting you touch them! The problem is that you’re acting like a creepy old man!”Of course, there was simply no way that I could match the Supreme Dragon in a contest of brute strength. It didn’t take long for her to overpower me; she slowly began to inch closer.“God damn you and your stupid wing fetish! Okay, fine! I’ll let you touch them, but only if you calm down first!”I gave up. There was no stopping her.“Very well. I will do as requested.” She stopped struggling the moment I gave the condition. It was clear that she was desperate to begin immediately.God damn it Lefi…“And you have to let me touch your wings too. It’d be unfair if you were the only one doing the touching,” I added.She probably won’t start getting all weird again if I make her let me touch her.“V-Very well. I shall, so allow me to start touching yours immediately.”She seemed a bit embarrassed, but promptly gave her consent and materialized her own wings. Like her hair, they were dyed a dazzling shade of silver. I wanted to give myself a pat on the back for being a man and actually asking. I’d always wanted to touch Lefi’s wings, but never really had the opportunity. At least not until now.“They’re beautiful.”I felt like I would feel the exact same way regardless of how often I saw them; their radiant shine never failed to impress.“R-Really?” Lefi’s blush deepened. “Y-Your wings are also quite the sight. They are the most impressive I have ever laid eyes on.”
“T-Thanks.”We awkwardly reached for each other’s wings.Woah.Lefi’s were soft as down and smooth as silk. I felt my hands drawn to them the moment I touched them; I wanted to grab ahold of them and never let go. I could feel myself getting absorbed in the act, entranced by her wings.I wanted to bury my face in them and close my eyes. They were so pleasant to the touch that I was certain sleeping on them was sure to send me straight to heaven.“Nnn…” Lefi sighed bewitchingly. “I-I don’t mind you touching me, but… could you be a slight bit more gentle…?”
“E-Err… my bad.”It seemed that her wings were at least as sensitive as my own. She moaned enchantingly every single time my fingers so much as grazed them.It didn’t take long for us to get so immersed in the act that we lost sight of everything but each other. She simply continued to touch my wings, and I hers. It was as if we were in our own little world.My breathing started growing more and more ragged as we continued. And so did hers.I finally took my focus off her wings and looked at her face, only to find her staring right back at my own.Her eyes were glazed and her cheeks dyed as red as could be.“…”We continued to gaze into each other’s eyes without saying a word. I couldn’t pull my eyes from the alluring expression that decorated her face.I took one of my hands off her wings and slowly brought it towards her cheek.“Uhm…”A noise neither of us had expected to hear immediately jerked us out of our daze.“Could the two of you please refrain from engaging in lewd activities in broad daylight? I would very much prefer if you waited until the rest of us were asleep.”Leila glared at us reproachfully.“Y-You’ve got it all wrong!”
“Y-You are mistaken! We are doing nothing of the sort!”Lefi and I instantly separated from one another and shouted in protest, filling the throne room with our indignant cries of denial.[1] Being flat chested is a status symbol. Reference to Lucky Star.<– Prev — Next –>

Yuki’s Ambition: The Creation of a ModelLeila’s gaze stung. It was so cold that both Lefi and I felt like it’d pierce right through us if we allowed her to continue staring at us. Unable to bear it, we excused ourselves. The dragon girl claimed to be tired and quickly retreated to take a nap, whereas I chose to head to the dungeon’s field floor under the pretense of wanting to practice magic.I took a deep breath as soon as I arrived, allowing fresh air to fill my lungs. As soon as they were filled, I sighed. I wasn’t too sure how I was supposed to bring myself to face Lefi. Things were sure to be awkward between us.There was no denying that I’d lost control of myself. Her wings had been so fascinating that I’d forgotten my self-restraint. Frankly put, touching them was addicting. All super high quality things had the ability to draw people to them, to retain attention for far longer than was reasonable. And Lefi’s wings were no exception. Even just running my fingers across them had totally blown my mind. The soft and silky sensation was so wonderfully addicting that I felt it deserved to be classified a dangerous narcotic.Still, it was my fault I lost control.You know, I think the best way for me to deal with this whole dilemma is just to pretend it never happened. Everything’ll be fine as long as I don’t make a big deal out of it. I mean, that’s what I did with the whole Illuna bloodsucking incident, and that’s turned out fine so far. In fact, I’d even go as far as to say it couldn’t have possibly turned out any better. Y-Yeah, you know what? Lefi’s probably thinking the same thing anyway. Things would start getting really awkward really fast if we started getting all conscious of each other, especially since we live together. Yup. You know what? That’s right. Nothing happened. Nothing at all.I was all but certain that, if I ended up becoming a politician back in Japan, I would have been known as “the asshole that never shut up about not making a big deal out of everything.”***It took a while, but I eventually switched gears and directed my mind towards a task that was a bit more productive: thinking about the dungeon’s abilities. I’d spotted an interesting function earlier, but I hadn’t the chance to test it. It, Creative Construction, provided me the ability to engineer any facility I wished, exactly as I imagined it. The only thing that limited the ability was its caster, which, in this case, was me.I had no idea as to exactly how it worked. All I knew was that it was what I liked to call a dungeon skill, an ability that functioned based off of the dungeon’s mysterious powers.The skill was user friendly and convenient, but naturally came with its own set of drawbacks. There was no such thing as a free lunch, after all.Its first major drawback was that it consumed a ridiculous amount of DP. A single cast of it would eat up everything I’d gotten from last night’s massacre, and then some. That said, its cost was still a mere tenth of what was needed to purchase the cheapest castle listed in the dungeon’s catalogue. Fortunately, the cost was static. It didn’t matter if I wanted to make a castle or a doghouse. They both cost exactly the same.The second major downside was that it was extremely unforgiving. Like with primordial magic, I needed to picture what I wanted to make, down to the finest detail. If the image I had in my head wasn’t clear enough, then the spell would end up failing to create what I desired. That is, my castle would just end up as a castle sized chunk of turd if I didn’t know exactly how I wanted it to look.Last but not least was the fact that it required mana to function. The amount of magical energy it needed scaled with the size of the final output. A doghouse wouldn’t have required too much mana, but a castle was a whole different story. I couldn’t even begin to fathom its requirements.Though Creative Construction had a tonne of restrictions and stipulations, I still thought it was well worth using. Its cost was one whole order of magnitude less than the cheapest castle listed in the dungeon catalogue, and three whole orders of magnitude less than the most expensive.It would literally take me decades to save up enough DP to purchase the most costly product. It wasn’t impossible for me to wait that long given that my lifespan was now well over a thousand years in length, but I didn’t want to. I just didn’t have the patience for it. There was no reason for me to consider buying anything that expensive without first giving Creative Construction a chance.More importantly, the dungeon skill allowed me to customize the castle to my liking—an opportunity I could hardly turn down. I wasn’t sure whether or not I would be able to make anything tasteful, but I knew I would prefer my own creation to the cookie cutter castle listed in the dungeon’s catalogue.Personally, I lacked the brain power to picture both the interior and exterior simultaneously. I was far too much of an amateur. Fortunately, Creative Construction was flexible enough to allow me to design the exterior on my first pass and renovate the interior thereafter, albeit at the cost of extra DP. As far as I was concerned, that was perfect. Being a M*necrafter, I knew that I could pull off tweaking the interior so long as I had the exterior crafted ahead of time.[1]All minecr*fters are basically wizards that excel in spatial magic, after all. I didn’t have any specific final design in mind, so I started making random miniature models using earth magic as I got my thoughts in order. Of course, I didn’t start constructing immediately. My first step was to do research by getting myself a few reference materials using DP. Specifically, I procured 100 pictures of castles from my previous world.My goal was to create something extravagant, so I tried finding screenshots from games, but alas, there weren’t any available. Regardless, I managed to psych myself up and get started.***“Heya Master, whatcha up to?”Lyuu approached from behind and curiously peered at the many dirt castles sitting at my feet. She was holding a large basket filled with wet clothes. It seemed that she was getting ready to hang the laundry out to dry.“Oh, hey Lyuu.”
“Wait, woah! Did you make all those, Master?”“Yeah,” I replied despondent as I slowly raised the upper half of my body off the patch of grass I’d been lying down on.
“Wow! Y’sure are good at crafts ‘n stuff! They look real good!”
“Thanks… Hearing that makes me feel a lot better.”
“I-Is somethin’ wrong? You’re soundin’ kinda down.”
“Eh, you know…” I frowned.I had all the research and skills I needed in order to create a magnificent castle. In fact, I’d even taken quite a liking to some of the miniatures I’d created. But by no means was I truly satisfied. None of the castles I’d created were up to par; I wanted to at least make something on the tier of An*r L*ndo. [2] But I couldn’t. No matter what I did, I found myself unable to create anything that solemn and majestic. Fr*m Software’s designers were simply out of my league. [3]Wait, why the hell have I already given up? I’ve only been at this for two goddamn hours!The wizards at F*om Software were sure to scoff at me if they heard me complain. They’d probably continued slaving away in front of their monitors, building and modeling until they started shedding tears of blood. My inability to emulate their work was a given. I’d only invested two hours to their thousands.Expecting to achieve their standard had been nothing short of stupid on my part.That said, I knew it wasn’t going to take me much longer. Unlike them, I didn’t have to use a game engine or 3D modeling tool. All I had to do was forge myself a mental image of the castle.And, as the Demon Lord of Creativity [4], I was sure to succeed so long as I continued to push myself forward.“Alright! One more time!”Again, I hyped myself up before closing my eyes and focusing on the castle I wished to construct.Imagine it. Come on Yuki, you can do this. All you have to do is imagine it.The citadel that manifested within my mind was dyed in black. It was covered from head to toe in the very same shade of black that filled the night around it. It was impenetrable. Its pitch black ramparts loomed over all that dared to challenge it, overpowering them with its imposing presence. Strong and sturdy was its gate. It was so thick that it could tank a dragon’s assault without budging the slightest bit. And it stood so tall that it could fit a giant with room to spare. Its walls were lined with towers adorned with sharp, pointed tips, and its residential area was made entirely out of jet-black mansions that extended as far as the eye could see.The sheer size of the property was abnormal. And at its center lay the palace, solemn as a chapel and large enough to dwarf its surroundings. Dull lights shined out from within the structure’s windows, illuminating it just enough for its outline to be seen in the darkness of the night. It was so stunning to see that it could only be described as phantasmagorical. And though it was ominous, it still tugged at the hearts of all that looked upon it.That was what I wanted to create: an intimidating fortress that inspired fear, dread, and passion in those that saw it. I wanted it to make its beholders feel not only tiny and insignificant, but also stupefied by its majesty.An ideal that no true man could deny.Once I solidified the image, I activated my primordial magic and forced the earth itself to move. The soil around me warped, obeying my commands.Creating a miniaturized model of something was normally quite difficult. There was a complicated and detailed manufacturing process, involving many steps that I failed to understand. Primordial magic, however, allowed me to circumvent the more complicated steps and skip to materializing the result exactly as I wished for it, so long as I could picture it clearly in my head.It didn’t take long for the fortress to finish coming together.“Oh, this one’s actually not too bad.”Though tiny, the castle I created held a majestic sense of presence. It was beautiful; I could feel it drawing me in already. Unfortunately, it was only made of dirt, so it was brown as opposed to the deep black I’d had in mind, but still, it looked quite impressive. I almost couldn’t bring myself to tear my eyes off it.“Wow Master! The one you just made is lookin’ super awesome!”
“Yeah. It turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.”Finally satisfied, I nodded. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted. A few of the finer details were still off, but it was good enough for me to work off of. I no longer needed to draft another concept from scratch.A sense of motivation assailed me; I felt the urge to continue practicing so I could use Creative Construction to complete the real deal on my first attempt.“Alright Lyuu, watch this! I’m going to make it even better!”
“E-Even better!? It ain’t good ‘nuff already!?” Her eyes sparkled. “Wow! I can’t wait!”
“Heh. They don’t call me the Demon Lord of Creation for nothing. Just watch! I’ll open your eyes to my glory!”And so, Lyuu ended up getting so caught up in watching me practice that she forgot to do the laundry.[1] Should be obvious, but this is “minecrafter.” Apparently some of the people that play the game actually call themselves this. `-`
[2] Anor Londo, beautiful large castle in Dark Souls.
[3] From Software. The people that made Dark Souls, Armored Core, and some other famous stuff. In the raw, they were called by a nickname, but apparently the English speaking fanbase doesn’t have anything similar. Oh well.

Yuki’s Ambition: The Mana Problem“Well, Lyuu? What do you have to say for yourself?”Lyuu and I returned to the throne room to find Leila awaiting us right by the field’s exit. She flashed the other maid a smile, one that almost instinctively caused me to shudder. Though it didn’t appear off, it somehow felt entirely devoid of all the emotion the expression of joy was supposed to contain.“U-Uhm… I-It’s not my fault…”
“I told you to return immediately after drying the laundry because I wanted you to assist me with another task.”
“I-I know, but I swear I must’ve had a spell cast on me or somethin’! I really was plannin’ on getting the laundry done real quick, but then I magically ended up gettin’ all distracted! I-I swear I wasn’t tryin’ to slack! I don’t even know how it happened!”
“Lyuu, that is not an excuse. The fact stands that you neglected your responsibilities.”
“Y-you’d get why if you just saw it, Leila! It was just that awesome! Come on, hear me out!”
“I think I have heard plenty already.”
“Huh!? W-Wait, where are you taking me? Leila? Leila!? Let go of me! Leila!?”Lyuu tried to resist, but it was futile. The other maid started dragging her off with ease. I didn’t have the slightest clue as to what Leila was about to do to the poor girl, but I could at least tell it wasn’t a good idea to interfere. Given that, I stayed silent and smiled wryly as I saw the two of them off.Once they were out of sight, I turned towards Lefi’s quarters, only to find her with her face still buried in a pillow.“Er… I uh… Hey, uh… Lefi.” It took me a few tries, but I eventually managed to initiate a conversation. “W-Would you mind if I asked you something real quick?”
“H-Huh!? Uh… U-uhm… sure,” Lefi’s eyes nervously darted around, but she eventually calmed down and started speaking in as normal a tone as she could. “I-I will answer what you wish so long as I am able.”“T-Thanks. Do you know any way for me to raise my max mp?”The only reason I returned to the throne room was because I’d wanted to ask her for advice. I would’ve loved to keep making mini-castles, but I couldn’t. My mana had run dry. And if a few hours of practice was all it took to drain it, I highly doubted I would actually be able to forge an entire castle with my current pool.Of course, I hadn’t been making castles the whole time. I’d taken a break right before Lyuu showed up, and another when Illuna and Shii joined us a bit later. The two had been playing together, but immediately stopped to voice their wonder as they saw the countless castle designs I had laid out. Seeing Illuna like that inspired me to create something to entertain her. And I figured I might as well make Lyuu smile while I was at it. I used primordial magic to create S*lvanian Families: cute, dressed up animals that lived in houses and other human-like environments. [1] I made a metric ton of them and ran my MP dry in the process. I wasn’t too happy with completely draining my mana because it disallowed me the opportunity to continue practicing. But still, it was worth it. Seeing the cute toys caused both girls to light up in joy.“You need to bolster your magical energies? You already have many times more than the average person, do you not?” Lefi looked at me quizzically. “Are you attempting to cast a forbidden spell?”
“Nah. I just don’t seem to have enough to make something I’ve been meaning to. I know I could always just go gain experience and level up, but I’d prefer to do some sort of exercise or training.”Working out had given my physical stats a noticeable boost, and I figured there was likely a magical equivalent.“Hmmm…” Lefi paused for a moment to think. “I mind not lending you my mana should you merely wish for a temporary boost.”
“You can do that?”
“Easily,” she nodded. “Recall how I first instructed you on the use of magic. Do you remember the manner in which I cycled my magical energies through your body?”
“Yeah?”Last I remembered, it was an act that could’ve caused my head to explode.“Lending mana is a similar process. The only difference is that I will channel my magic into you as opposed to through you.”
“Huh, that’s neat. You think I could do it too?”
“Not as you are now. You would first need to improve your control,” Lefi smirked. “You need not reach my heights, but you still do require a fair amount of improvement. Lending your magical energy involves tuning its wavelength to match that of the person you’re giving it to. It’s no simple task.”The proud look she had on her face was her usual one. She was finally back to being herself.“Alright then. I’ll come looking for you when the time comes.”
“Know this. My services come at a price.”
“Fine, what do you want?”
“I am willing to accept payment in donuts.”
“Sure.”As always, Lefi’s sweet tooth was raring to go. I couldn’t understand how she could tolerate eating sweets at every given opportunity. If I was her, I would’ve long gotten sick of them. Her all time favourite seemed to be the chocolate I’d fed her when we first met. She’d always nibble away at it bit by bit and attempt to make it last in the same manner as would a certain sugar-crazed detective.“Borrowing my mana is not the only method at your disposal. You could also practice by firing off higher tiered spells and exhausting your reserves on a daily basis. I believe you have one at your disposal. It is one you have taken quite a liking to, in fact.”
“You mean the water dragon thing?”
“Yes, that one,” Lefi nodded. “Continue firing spells of that caliber and you should not only bolster your reserves, but also raise your proficiency in controlling magical energy.”
“Right.”To be honest, I wasn’t quite satisfied with the water dragon spell. It was supposed to be made of hot water, but I lacked the skill to maintain both the shape and temperature simultaneously, especially seeing as how I had to use earth magic to mix in a bit of grit to power it up. I’d practiced the spell quite a bit, but I’d never spammed it to the point of running out of mana. In fact, today was the first time it’d ever happened. Though I didn’t have it right, I wasn’t going to be putting any more effort into practicing or refining it. Creating castles also consumed mana, and was a much better use of my time. Each fortress I crafted would further solidify my mental image of the final product. Moreover, building castles made it easier for me to switch to creating Sylv*nian Families for Illuna in my spare time. And as it made her happy, I was more than glad to do it.“Thanks Lefi. That was some solid advice.”
“I-It was no a big deal. I-I am glad you found it useful.”Lefi fidgeted a bit as she blushed. The embarrassed gestures she made were so cute and charming that I couldn’t help but admire them.[1] This is a Japanese plastic toy thing for girls, kinda like barbie. Apparently they export them too. Example below.<– Prev — Next –>

Playing House“Welcome back dear. Dinner’s ready and waiting.”
“Thanks honey. You know how much I love the meals you make me, especially after a long period of non-stop work.”
“I do dear. Everything’s already all set on the dining table. Today, I made rice, miso soup, sashimi, karaage, pepper steak, and ramen.”
“W-wow, you sure went all out.”That’s one hell of a heavy meal right there…
“I knew you were going to be tired after coming home, so I tried to make enough food to help cheer you up.”
“T-Thanks honey, I appreciate it… Wow, this is delicious.”
“That would be because I made it with love, dear.”I smiled wryly as I continued to “eat.” Illuna, the person supposedly responsible for cooking up the meal, beamed at me as I did. Of course, she hadn’t actually cooked, and the two of us hadn’t suddenly started acting like a husband and wife. The whole situation was make believe. It was all just a part of us playing house.We were currently inside of a small, toy-like building, specifically the kind you’d often see in playgrounds or parks that catered to young children. Though I’d made it out of earth magic, it lacked the bland brown that all my initial creations had shared. Its exterior and interior were both decorated in vivid reds, blues, and greens. It looked pretty damn good, if I did say so myself.My proficiency in earth magic had increased dramatically. I’d become not only able to affect the colours, but also the texture and overall granularity of my creations. At first, I’d thought that earth magic was only capable of controlling dirt. Evidently, I was wrong. The magic could manipulate minerals and gemstones just as easily. In my previous life, people had crushed stones in order to create colourful dyes. I saw no reason for me not to do the same, so I began using all sorts of ores and gems in order to bring colour to my creations. Fine tuning the colours turned out to be much more difficult a task than I initially anticipated, but I eventually got the hang of it after putting in enough practice.The whole experience once again reminded me that magic required an open mind. Flexibility was key to preventing mages from getting trapped within rabbit holes. As the Demon Lord of Creativity, I decided I would eventually master many different types of magic to ensure that I remained adaptable.On a side note, Lefi was right. My max mp had increased, albeit only by the slightest bit. I was confident that I’d eventually raise it high enough to craft myself a castle so long as I continued to practice.“Um…”
“Yeah, Leila?”
“There is something I would like to confirm. Were you the one that created this structure, my Lord?”
“Yeah.”I wasn’t the only one playing house with Illuna. Leila had joined us as well. She was supposed to be acting as our daughter, but she couldn’t help but find herself a bit too distracted to play the game. All her attention was focused on the backdrop I’d made.“With all due respect, my Lord, you and Lefi are both ridiculous. Your ability to weave complex spells with ease is nothing short of absurd. I fear that I may soon lose sight of the standard the average mage is held to.”A distant look appeared in her eyes as she spoke.Now that she mentions it, I don’t even know what the average mage is supposed to be able to do.“I’ve never seen anyone but Lefi cast magic, so she’s pretty much become my standard. Are our abilities really that far outside the norm?”
“Undoubtedly,” she said. A momentary pause followed her affirmation. She seemed to be gathering her thoughts. “Would I be correct in assuming that both of you are capable of casting primordial magic? I don’t believe I’ve ever seen either of you chant prior to casting a spell.”
“Yep.”
“I thought so,” she nodded. “Primordial magic is effectively treated as a lost art. I highly doubt it has any more than a few dozen practitioners.”
“Really…?”
“Modern spells are entirely chant-based. In fact, they are less akin to true magic than they are magic-based techniques. The current standard for mages is to chant to create a frame for their spells before weaving their magical energies into it. The spell activates once the mage injects a sufficient amount of mana.”Leila’s explanation was factual and to the point. I almost felt like I was listening to a teacher.P-Primordial magic is a lost art? Huh. Though, I guess I can see that. Lefi uses it pretty heavily herself, and she’s supposedly the strongest living thing there is. It only makes sense for it to be something not everyone can use.“Wait, you’re saying that modern magic is basically centered around the chant, right?”
“Precisely so.”
“That’s the exact opposite of what Lefi told me. She said that magic’s supposed to be centered around its caster’s imagination and that chants are just for additional support.”
“The only individuals capable of casting spells through the method you described are those with a high affinity for magic. The records say that all demons had the ability to cast primordial magic in the distant past, and that our species gradually lost the ability as time progressed. The only modern casters capable of reproducing primordial magic are atavisms.”
“I see.”I think I get it. Lefi said that demons are just lumps of magical particles that spontaneously come to life. Most of the later generations probably resulted from demons interbreeding with other races because there weren’t that many of them. Their magical affinities must’ve just slowly dropped as the generations passed. In fact, they probably developed chants as a form of technology to make up for their inability to do things that their ancestors could.My ability to use primordial magic probably stemmed from the way the dungeon created me. It made my body much more like an ancient demon than a modern one.God damn it dungeon. You have no idea how much I love you right now. I almost want to run up to your core and give it a smooch. But that aside, I’m seriously lacking in my knowledge of how things work here. I should probably go visit a human or demon settlement and stay there a while so I can learn more about this world and its workings. That’s probably the best way for me to protect myself from any potential major incidents.“Geez! Come on you guys! We’re supposed to be in the middle of playing house! Stop getting distracted!” Illuna angrily puffed out her cheeks.
“Right, my bad. Where were we again?”
“We’re supposed to be husband and wife!”
“Oh, yeah. I remember now. Leila was supposed to be our daughter, but she contracted a supposedly incurable illness, so I went out on a journey in order to find a way to save her. I ended up finding it, but she died right before I made it back, right?”
“Yup! Make sure you play properly this time, okay?”
“Yeah, yeah, I will.”
“Ummm…”
“What’s up Leila?”
“Is it really absolutely necessary for my character to die?”
“Yup!”Sorry, but our little princess’ words are final. But don’t worry, I’ll at least make sure we take good care of your corpse.<– Prev — Next –>

Lyuu, Rir, and RelaxationI opened the throne room’s door and entered the area that made up its exterior. There, I found Lyuu poking her head out the cave’s entrance. She was slowly looking from left to right and back again, as if she were surveying her surroundings.“The heck are you doing all the way out here, Lyuu?”
“Oh, heya Master. I was just hangin’ ’round ‘cause I think you said something ‘bout goin’ out with Rir today.”“Yeah, I’ve pretty much left him to his own devices lately, so I thought it was probably time for me to check up on him.”Though, that’s more of an excuse than anything. To be honest, I just want to get out of the house. I’ve been doing nothing but practicing earth magic lately, and I’m starting to get sick of it. I need to go beat up some monsters to relieve my stre—Er, I mean “field test a few new spells.”“That’s kinda why I’ve been standin’ here. I thought I mighta been lucky enough to see him if I stuck around, but it doesn’t look like he’s here yet.”I double checked the map after listening to her and confirmed that there was a marker indicating a friendly unit sitting right outside the cave.“He’s been here.”
“Huh!?”
“Yeah, he’s just hiding.”
“What!? Why!?”Lyuu’s face contorted in astonishment.“Because he thinks you’re creepy. Duh.”
“W-Wow Master, you totally just gave it to me straight! You didn’t even try sugarcoatin’ it at all!”
“I mean, think about it. How’d you feel about having someone basically constantly follow you around?”
“Ugh…” Lyuu groaned.
“I know you think of him like someone you need to worship, but he doesn’t like it when you treat him like that. I’m pretty sure I’d start running away from you too, if you did the same to me. It’s just… weird.”
“I-I getcha, but I can’t help it. He’s a fenrir, you know, a freakin’ fenrir! You know how awesome they are!?”Lyuu began telling me the legends passed down by her people. According to folklore, there once existed a fenrir that fought off an entire army of humans and destroyed the town they were based in. That same beast challenged tens of thousands of monsters. It continued fighting them non-stop over the course of several years before finally emerging victorious. And, many years later, it brought vitality to the field in which it breathed its last breath. Flowers blossomed from its final resting grounds and soon grew into a forest whose lands remained ever fertile. The warwolf tribe had descended from that very same fenrir’s line. And for that reason, Lyuu’s tribe believed it was only natural for them to worship the species as a whole; she didn’t think of her actions as even the slightest bit creepy or weird. In fact, her eyes almost seemed to burn with passion as she spoke.To be honest, a good chunk of that sounds like bullshit, but I guess it technically is possible. Fenrirs are legendary creatures, and apparently even Lefi found it quite difficult to defeat one, so it’s safe to assume they’re strong as hell. But wait, fenrirs are wolves. Why would their children be beastkin?I paused for a moment, only to remember that there existed a spell or something that allowed non-humans to take on a human-like form. Case in point: Lefi.Wait, does that mean it’s possible for Lefi and I to have a ki—My eyes widened as I realized where my thoughts had taken me.God damn it brain! What the hell are you thinking!?“Wow Master, your face started gettin’ all red and stuff real quick. Did hearin’ about the legends really move ya that much?”
“Shut up. That’s not it. I was thinking about something else. Don’t ask.”I rejected the notion several times over out of sheer panic before redirecting my thoughts towards something else. Hearing about her tribe’s legends allowed me to understand the reason Lyuu revered Rir the way she did. To her, he was like a celebrity. She’d heard a lot about him, so seeing him in real life had caused the fangirl within her to freak the hell out. Admittedly, I could see exactly where she was coming from. I likely would’ve had a similar reaction upon meeting any of my favourite voice actors.“Do you want to join us?”
“Can I really!?”
“Only if you promise to listen to instructions. You’ll probably die if you get lost.”
“Erk… T-That sounds kinda scary, but sure! I-I promise I’ll listen real good, so please lemme join ya!”***“Uhyyaaaaaaaaaahhh!?”
“God damn it, Lyuu. Could you shut up already?”I frowned as Lyuu, who was sitting right behind me, screamed loud enough to make my eardrums burst.“I-I can’t Master! W-we’re going way too fast!”She desperately clung onto Rir’s back for dear life. We weren’t going too fast, but she was still sure to go flying off the moment she let go.“Rir’s been taking it easy and going pretty slowly. He can actually go much faster if he wants,” I shrugged. “Stop, Rir. This spot’s good.”The giant wolf used his whole body to decelerate and came to a complete halt in a matter of moments.“Nraarghghgh!?”Lyuu screamed incoherently as she flew right off his back and smashed her face into the ground below. The stop had been way too sudden for her. She couldn’t help but get thrown off.“Stop making weird noises and calm down already.”
“Y-You’re making it sound like I was doin’ it ‘cuz I wanted to!”She retorted as she slowly got back up. She seemed surprisingly energetic for someone whose face was caked in a layer of mud.“Ugh… I should’ve known, but Rir’s real fast.”
“Well, yeah.”
“A-And why are you doin’ the criticizing, Master!? You’re the one that’s acting all weird here! How the hell do you expect a gal like me to hang on when we’re goin’ that fast!?”
“I mean, we weren’t even going that fast…”
“You’re only sayin’ that ‘cause you’re a weirdo! There ain’t no normal person capable of staying all calm and composed at that kinda speed!”Wow. Talk about rude. It’s not my fault I like thrill rides. And it’s also definitely not my fault that they’ve been growing on me as of late.“Oh by the way, you might want to get back here, and quick. You’re pretty much right next to a monster.”
“Huh!? Wait, seriously!? Holy crap!”Lyuu fearfully turned her head around, only to immediately start dashing back towards us the moment she saw the thing that’d been standing a bit of a ways behind her.“Gelgwa! Gya gya!”It was a creature whose meat worked quite well in dishes that typically made use of chicken: a rockbird. It noticed us and started squawking vigilantly. Its death metal vocalist-like cries were filled with wariness.“Ugh, that’s loud as hell. Shut up and turn into food already goddammit.”I briefly focused my magical energies before rapidly bringing my hands together to cast a spell. I didn’t even bother getting off Rir’s back.There was a low rumble as the magic activated. The earth right underneath the rockbird’s head shook and swelled, derforming into a pair of iron-like plates with spikes protruding from their insides. The two rose, lining themselves up with the bird’s head before closing in on each other, punching countless holes into the poor animal’s face. Blood sprayed all over as the now headless rockbird lifelessly collapsed.The spell I’d just cast was one I dubbed “Iron Maiden.” It was a bit slow; keener, faster enemies could dodge it with ease. But it made up for its lack of speed with an incredible amount of power. I had no doubt that it could deal major damage to anything too sluggish to react to it.“W-wow…” Lyuu’s eyes opened wide. “Ain’t that a shocker. You really did just kill a rockbird in one hit.”She had a smile on her face, but it seemed kinda cramped; her mouth was twitching in disbelief.“Yeah, they’re weak. Anyway, let’s go. We need to find ourselves some more prey.”I urged Lyuu to get back on Rir while putting the rockbird’s corpse in my item box.“Huh!? W-We’re gonna keep goin’!?”
“Duh. We literally just got started.”
“I-I uhm… really ‘preciate you lettin’ me ride Rir and stuff, but… could ya please go just a little bit slower?”
“No need to be so reserved. I know you love high speed thrills.”
“Grr!”
“See? Even Rir’s telling you to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Now get on.”
“W-why does it kinda feel like you guys are up to no good!?”I grinned as I pulled Lyuu, who was trembling in fear, up onto Rir’s back.“Alright Rir, go!”
“Aaaaaaaaaaaarghhh!!”And so, Lyuu’s screams continued echoing throughout the Wicked Forest for quite some time.<– Prev — Next –>

Yuki’s Ambition: The Castle’s ConstructionEverything was ready.I had all the DP I needed. My image of the castle was solid. I’d created so many miniature replicas of the damn thing that the level of my primordial magic skill had increased.The only remaining concern was mana, but I was pretty sure I was going to be fine on that front as well. I had three high tier mana potions prepped and waiting for me. Rather than the type that instantly recovered my magical energies, I’d opted for the type that increased my mana’s natural rate of regeneration. Moreover, I also had Lefi for backup.Everything was ready.My success was all but guaranteed. If I failed, then I would honestly have no choice but to chalk it up to my own immaturity as a Demon Lord.“So what’re you gonna do, Yuki?” Illuna curiously tilted her head.
“Alright, listen closely, Illuna. I’m about to carve my destiny with my very own two hands. I’m about to pry open a path into the unknown and seize that which drives me to dream!”
“What manner of nonsense are you blabbering about now, Yuki?”
“Heh. It’s not nonsense,” I denied Lefi’s claim with a firm nod. “This is just what it means to be a man. Not all our dreams are meant to be understood.”
“It appears that there is little point in listening to any more of his prattling,” Lefi sighed as she turned to face the other three girls. “He’s too caught up in his obsessions to make sense of his own words.”
“You betcha. This ain’t the first time I’ve seen Master kinda start gettin’ all weird.”
“I concur,” said Leila. “But I also cannot deny that the point he made is valid. His actions cannot be said to be far outside the norm given that he is indeed a man.”The peanut gallery was being really noisy, but I didn’t give half a flying fuck. Their words were incapable of stopping me. In fact, there was nothing capable of stopping me in my current state. My imagination, my will, and my magical energies were all aligned and working towards a common goal. And with their powers combined, they made me a true man amongst men. Probably.We were currently situated within the plains. I’d summoned everyone and convinced them all to tag along so they could watch me achieve my goal. Even Shii and Rir had joined us.“Alright Lefi, I’ll be counting on you.”
“I know already, so hurry up and begin. I would very much rather you cease looking at us with your expression the way it is.”Lefi smiled wryly as she nodded. Unlike the others, she already knew exactly what I was about to attempt. I turned back around after confirming that she was ready to help out if need be before opening up my item box and pulling out all three potions. I raised one to my face and instantly downed its contents.It was bitter as all hell. The taste was beyond disgusting. Still, I managed to drink both the second and third potions with just as much vigour. The awful flavour was nothing in the face of my ambition.“…”I paused for a moment to place all three containers back into my item box before taking a deep breath and beginning to concentrate. The castle appeared within my mind as I closed my eyes. The image I had of it was concrete as usual; I’d spent so much time refining it that it’d even started to show up in my dreams.Images of both the interior and exterior filled my mind. The exterior design was perfect. I’d already gotten that down to the finest detail. The interior design was a bit rougher around the edges, but that was fine. I could always rework it later.The castle was going to be built around the door that connected the plains to the throne room. I’d already relocated everything else and moved it out of the way. There was no need for me to think about anything but the massive structure I was about to build. With my concentration at its peak, I finally tapped the Creative Construction button.An incredible sense of lethargy assaulted me the moment the dungeon skill activated. Magical energy was being sucked from my body at a rate far outside my expectations. The skill was consuming even more than I’d initially anticipated. Completing the castle was going to be tough.I desperately resisted the pressure weighing down on me as I continued focusing on the image I had in mind. Warm, greasy sweat began forming on my brow as I fought the urge to give up and pass out.Three mana pots had not been anywhere near enough. My castle was just way too big. All my magical energy was being forcefully wrenched from my body; my reserves dwindled with every passing moment. Though I started with a mana pool of over ten thousand, I’d less than a third of it remaining.“Lefi!”
“You needn’t remind me,” she said. “I have already completed my preparations.”She’d long realized that my mana had started to drop at an alarming rate, so she’d gotten herself ready to lend me hers. The dragon girl pressed her small, delicate hands against my back and began to assist me the moment I asked her for help.A staggering amount of power violently poured into my body. With it came a searing heat. I immediately began taking deep, heavy breaths while clenching my teeth in order to stop myself from getting overwhelmed by the force of the mana Lefi channeled through me.“T-That is quite the impressive amount of magical energy,” said Leila.
“Y-Yeah, there’s a whole ton! There’s way more than enough to cast some sorta like super powerful spell!” added Lyuu.I clearly heard the girls talking, but I lacked the composure to reply.The torrent of magical energy Lefi supplied me with flowed out of me just as quickly as it entered. My body felt like it was going to overheat. It was processing way more power than it was capable of handling. But still, I hung on. I continued to bear with it, enduring with nothing but the force of my will.The ground began to rumble. The shaking rapidly grew in intensity with the passage of time.“W-Wha!? T-the heck is goin’ on!?”It didn’t take long for it to become so violent that I felt like I could no longer tolerate it.I felt the urge to give in.But then it happened.A deafening roar assaulted my eardrums as something split the earth and forced its way up above the ground, kicking up a massive cloud of dust as it did.All the noise suddenly vanished. We were left with naught but a soundless void.Silence.The dust settled, slowly revealing the structure that’d burst through the ground.It was thereThe castle I’d replicated time and time again had finally become a reality. It was so tall that it almost seemed to rise up to the heavens themselves; I couldn’t see the top from where I was standing.It was exactly as I imagined it.No.It was even more.“I-I did it.”I blinked a few times in disbelief as the strength drained from my body. I fell onto my knees, and began to collapse, but Lefi caught me from behind and propped me up.“You have done well,” she said.
“Hahaha… yeah. Isn’t it just awesome?”
“Indeed. I admit it is far beyond what I fathomed it to be.”Hearing Lefi’s honest, straightforward praise caused my expression to slacken. A wide grin made its way onto my face. I turned around and looked at all the other girls, only to find that they were all staring at it, eyes widened and jaws dropped in shock.Even Rir was gaping in mute amazement.“Well? What do you guys think?”
“W-Wow! It’s super awesome! Is it gonna be our new house?”
“You got it. It’s got way too many rooms for its own good, so feel free to pick whichever you like.”Though, with that said, the breath-taking palace was the only part whose interior was complete. Everything else was just pretty much made up of a series of empty hallways. I was planning to flesh it all out eventually, but that would have to be something I did in the future.“…I apologize, my Lord. It appears I was grossly underestimating the full extent of your abilities. The fortress you have created is nothing short of impressive.”
“S-So this is why you were makin’ all those models. This thing’s super awesome. I’ve never seen anythin’ else like it!”I couldn’t help but happily nod as I listened to their compliments.“Yuki, I would like to ask you just one thing.”
“Sure, Lefi. I’m feeling good as hell right now, so ask away.”
“How exactly are we supposed to return to the throne room?”
“…Oops.”<– Prev — Next –>

Yuki’s Ambition: FinaleThe castle I constructed ended up proving itself far too out of scale for our everyday use. Of course, its size was entirely intentional. Half the structure’s dignity came from its sheer mass. Unfortunately, dignity and practicality didn’t always go hand in hand. I failed to realize my failure at first. I was too busy basking in everyone’s praise to notice that I’d made a mistake.The corridors were too long; the amount of distance between any two locations was ridiculous. Living in the newly constructed castle was nothing short of an obnoxious inconvenience. A good bit of time had passed since its creation, but not a single one of its many rooms had been claimed for personal use. In fact, all the adults had basically stopped visiting it altogether. Illuna visited it with Shii and Fluffrir to play and explore every day, but that was it. They were the only ones that’d gleamed even the slightest bit of benefit from my efforts.All the dungeon’s residents still lived in the throne room, and not the newly constructed one. Having two throne rooms made it pretty difficult to distinguish which was which, so I decided to call the castle’s throne room “the throne room,” and the dungeon’s original throne room “the true throne room.”Fortunately, not all my effort had gone to waste. Anyone that ventured into the cave containing my dungeon would see a massive castle looming in the darkness, and I was certain it would at least intimidate them enough to deliver a blow or two to their confidence. To that end, I’d also given the castle a bit of decoration. I lined its halls with western-styled suits of armour and even used my earth magic to craft a beautiful garden. The castle’s courtyard and interior served the exact same purpose as its exterior. It was all there for the sake of grandeur; it only existed to crush the resolve of any that dared to intrude.Thinking back on it, I should’ve known that the castle wouldn’t see much use. The Demon Lords in JRPGs didn’t wander about their domains or use their own facilities. They simply remained seated on their thrones and majestically awaited their challengers. It would only make sense for the demon lord and their close companions to reside within the throne room.Creating the castle was an idiotic decision. But I was fine with that. I understood and accepted it as fact. The only reason it’d come to be in the first place was because I’d wanted to create something fantastical. Fantasy was something that existed to make people’s hearts flutter with excitement. Like D*sney Land and many other places that delivered on fantasies, my castle was built to entertain. No one lived in Disn*y Land. Thus, it was only natural for my castle to be free of residents as well. That was all there was to it.Okay, yeah no. Dis*ey Land, my ass. I’m just trying to convince myself that all that time and effort hadn’t gone to waste.I heaved an exasperated sigh as I slumped down onto my throne.“There is no need for you to be so depressed, Yuki. I can attest that your castle is the most magnificent I have ever laid eyes on,” said Lefi.
“You don’t have to lie to me, you know? I can tell that you’re just dying to ask why I decided to make it so needlessly large.”Hearing my reaction caused Lefi to stifle a giggle.“What?” I groaned.
“This is the first time I have ever seen you in such a withered state. Admittedly, it is quite amusing to observe.”I saw her lips momentarily curve up into a smile as she turned around and plopped herself onto my lap. She then relaxed and naturally allowed her slackened back to fall against my chest.Both the touch of her skin and her pleasant, familiar scent filled me with a sense of warmth.“W-What’s up?”
“Do you mind it?”
“E-Er… I don’t.”She sounded really calm. A part of me felt that getting flustered would be akin to losing some sort of unexplained challenge, so I tried my best to put up a front and pretend that nothing was wrong.Neither of us said another word.We were silent, but it wasn’t awkward.In fact, it was comforting.“How warm,” Lefi suddenly broke the silence.
“Well yeah, I’m alive, so…”My awkward reply caused Lefi to chuckle.“Indeed you are.”I didn’t quite get where she was trying to take the conversation, so I lowered my gaze and looked down at her face. She seemed to notice, as she promptly half turned towards me and returned my stare.“You know, Yuki?”
“Yeah?”
“The time I spend with you is enjoyable. You are a very interesting man, and you bring me no shortage of amusement.”
“What’s this all of a sudden? Are you trying to cheer me up or something?”
“Precisely so. You’ve spent the better part of the last few days sulking. I believe that, as your elder, it is my duty to revitalize your spirits.”She shrugged, as if to say that she’d spoken the line in jest.“Well then. I didn’t think you’d actually admit to it.”A wry smile appeared on my face.“Though you tend to remain level-headed, it is impossible for me to deny that there is an idiotic side to you as well. That is why I will continue to watch over your actions in a manner befitting my status as a responsible adult.”
“Says the person that starts throwing a tantrum every time they lose at anything.”
“T-That has nothing to do with maturity!” Lefi shouted. “Taking a game seriously is a wholesome part of the fun!”Her lips twisted into a pout as she started indignantly glaring at me. My response was to snicker as I dropped a hand onto her head.“Hey Lefi.”
“What?”
“Thank you.”She smiled as she turned more towards me and pressed a cheek against my chest.“No fair! I wanna get on Yuki’s lap too!”Having returned from her expedition, Illuna interrupted us with a shout.“I fail to see the unfairness of which you speak, Illuna. There is enough space for two.”
“Yay! Then I want a hug too!”Illuna pitter pattered down the hallway before kicking off the ground and transitioning into a leap with all her momentum still intact.“What the!?”I blinked a few times in surprise as she suddenly crashed right into me. I went from supporting one person’s weight to two in an instant.“I-I dunno about having both of you on me at once. This is starting to get kinda weighty.”
“You are a man, Yuki. Act like one.”
“I know right! You’re not supposed to call girls heavy!”
“You guys say that, but this chair is hard, and getting my legs pressed into it is kinda painful,” I groaned.
“Don’t worry, Yuki! I’ll hug it better!” Illuna wrapped her arms around my waist. “Pain, pain, go away!”
“Wow, that was really effective Illuna! I’m all better now,” I said as I forced a smile.
“Pedophile,” Lefi’s eyes narrowed in disapproval.
“I’m not quite sure that’s the kind of thing you’re supposed to say to someone’s face…”<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Message for my ParentsHi Mom! Hi Dad!I know you can’t be with me anymore.You fought to protect me when the humans attacked. You grabbed your weapons and tried to stop them from hurting us. You fought off lots and lots of them, but there were too many. You started losing.But neither of you budged. You didn’t back off at all, not even when you got hurt really bad.And then you died.But don’t worry, Mom, I still remember. I still remember what you said to me right before you passed on.You told me to live.I was really panicked back then, but I still got what you were trying to tell me. You died for me. That was why you and Dad fought, and why you never backed down no matter what.It was all for me.I knew I needed to respect your wishes. So I ran. I ran as hard as I could, even though I was sure I was done for. I felt like all hope was gone. My mom and dad were gone, my home was gone, and I was going to be a goner too. My legs hurt. I thought it felt like I was going to collapse.But I kept running.I had to.Because you both died to try and save me.And it worked! I really did get saved.The members of my new family rescued me right when I thought I was doomed. Oh right! You guys never met my new family, so I guess I should tell you a bit about them!First, is Yuki. He’s kinda like my big bro! He’s really nice and funny. He always gives me blood when I ask for it. He pays a lot of attention to me and tries his best to make me feel happy. Even just seeing him makes me want to thank him. I really love him!I remember how you guys always told me about how important blood was for vampires. We need it to live, so it’s kinda like something sacred, right?Mom, I think you said that I wasn’t supposed to take it from anyone unless I really loved them and wanted to be a family like you and Dad. I was only supposed to drink blood from animals until I found someone like that.That was why I asked Yuki for his blood. He was really nice, and he even saved me, so I got really attached to him really quickly!Just being with him makes me feel warm and relaxed.He isn’t the only one I really love either. I love Lefi a lot too! She’s kinda like my new big sister. She talks weird and sometimes acts a lot like a kid, so I’m not really sure if she passes as a big sister, but you can always count on her when push comes to shove.Oh, and two new people joined our family just a little while ago! Their names are Leila and Lyuu. Lefi called them concubines. I didn’t really know what that was, so I asked them, and they got angry. They kinda scared me. But then they turned out to be really nice people! I get along with both of them really well.My new family’s always really fun to be around. We even have pets! One’s named Rir, and the other’s named Shii. They always play with me and cheer me up if I’m feeling down.I smile a lot everyday! It hurt a lot when you guys died, but spending time with everyone made it not hurt so much anymore. I’m really happy!You guys don’t need to worry about me anymore.I’m okay now.Thanks Mom. Thanks Dad. I love you.<– Prev — Next –>

Character Summary
The Dungeon’s DenizensYuki
Class: Demon Lord of Judgement
Race: Demon Lord (Formerly: Archdemon)
Notable Traits: Dungeon Master, protagonist
Likes: Things that can move a man’s heart, and ****.
Description: Yuki is a shameless man that takes little note of how he is seen by other people. He has recently evolved and obtained a second set of wings. These wings have bolstered his ability to fly; they have provided him with both additional speed and maneuverability. That said, his airborne maneuverability still falls short of Lefi’s. His judgement is, for the most part, solid. However, his inexperience has often led to carelessness. Lefi’s teasing has caused him to be more conscious of the consequences of his actions. He’s still not 100% convinced that he really is a demon.Leficios
Nickname: Lefi
Class: Supreme Dragon
Race: Ancient Dragon
Notable Traits: Platinum hair.
Likes: Sweets, Yuki’s wings, and ****.
Description: Lefi is very knowledgeable, but it doesn’t show too often due to her childish, selfish nature. She’s recently started thinking that it would be fine for her to remain in her human form in perpetuity. She’s a lazy slob, but Yuki’s incessant bitching has managed to annoy her enough for her to start getting her shit together. Just a bit.Illuna
Race: Vampire (Demon)
Notable Traits: Blonde, little Girl, innocent.
Likes: Yuki’s blood. All the dungeon’s denizens, but especially Yuki.
Description: Illuna is known for being cheerful. Her ever present joyful mood infects the dungeon’s other residents and brings smiles to their faces. She’s actually quite smart, and can win at board games if she tries, but she doesn’t want anyone to know, so she always holds back. She’s hidden several of her skills and titles. Yuki hasn’t realized. Lefi has, but doesn’t particularly care.Leila
Race: Horned Sheep Demon
Notable Traits: A competent maid.
Likes: Knowledge
Description: Leila is a relaxed, kind person. She’s been working in the dungeon as a maid ever since Yuki saved her from slavery. She’s fairly knowledgeable. Her understanding of the present state of the world eclipses even Lefi’s. Lyuu’s the only person that knows, but she’s actually a hardcore scholar. She observes the dungeon on a daily basis, and keeps logs on even the finest of details.Lyuuinne Gyroll
Nickname: Lyuu
Race: Warwolf (Beastkin)
Notable Traits: An incompetent and worthless maid.
Likes: Fluffrir
Description: Her personality makes her seem like the type of girl that would really enjoy a sporting event. In fact, she somewhat resembles Hom*ra from P*wer Pros. [1] Like Leila, she was recently saved from a life of slavery. She views Fenrirs as sacred. She decided that she simply had to stay around the dungeon the moment she cast her eyes on Fluffrir. She used to be a diligent, hard-working young lady, but Yuki’s antics have reflected poorly on her. And as such, it is no longer possible to describe her as anything but pitiable. She’s actually a runaway.Shii
Race: Slime
Notable Traits: Cute pet.
Likes: Naps
Description: Shii is the first monster that Yuki ever summoned. She likes taking things at her own pace. She’s actually leveled up quite a bit, and is on the verge of evolving. Illuna’s recently taught her how to play Othello, and she’s surprisingly decent at it.Fluffrir
Nickname: Rir
Race: Fenrir
Notable Traits: Male, fluffy, and pessimistic.
Likes: Hunting and Yuki, his master.
Description: Fluffrir used to be treated as the guy on the lowest rungs of the dungeon’s social ladder, but that’s changed with the advent of the two maids. He’s now only third lowest. He spends a lot of time playing with Illuna and Shii. He doesn’t particularly like Lyuu because she follows him everywhere. In fact, he finds her annoying, and even ended up staying away from the dungeon just to avoid her. He actually has dozens upon dozens of subordinates, and has established a sort of pack with him as its alpha. Trash Mobs (Characters from the Kingdom of Allysia)Riutt Glorio Allysia
Role: The Allysian Prince
Description: Riutt is diligent and committed to his work, but he suffers from excess patriotism. His love for his country burns so brightly that it warps his perception of danger. Like many other young men his age, he’s reckless. He thinks that everything will go his way if he takes things into his own hands. His foolishness and fiery passion can’t really be helped, given his age.Raylow Lurubia

Notable Traits: Middle aged
Description: A man that believes in caution and prudence. He has excellent foresight, and prides himself in his ability to avoid disasters. He was recently asked to assist in supporting the expedition force, but he firmly refused and declared that he was against deploying soldiers to the Wicked Forest. He’s terrified of Yuki’s anger and desperately hopes that the Demon Lord won’t return for a round of retribution. The excessive stress caused by his concerns has led to equally excessive hair loss.Gamdia Roston

An Event In The Prince’s Study“Shit! God fucking damn it!”Riutt Glorio Allysia smashed his desk as profanities flew from his mouth, one after another.The report that’d just entered his ears had ignited in him an irrepressible fury. One of his recent initiatives, the Wicked Forest Expedition, had more than just ended in failure. Its outcome was the absolute worst possible. The entire expedition force had basically been annihilated. The only unit that survived was the one that’d turned tail and fled from the enemy. Every other soldier and mercenary they’d sent had failed to return. They’d been completely destroyed.Naturally, the man in charge of the unit that had survived was judged a coward. He was immediately removed from his post and permanently blacklisted from the Allysian knight order.“Fucking damn it!” The prince gave his table one last smack as he thought through the consequences of his failure. He had promised his investors profit. He told them that they were sure to benefit so long as they trusted him with their funds and believed in him. But he failed. He had nothing to show to those that had supported him. And that wasn’t even the end of it. Riutt understood that the blunder had taken a toll on his reputation. He knew that he had turned many off from investing in his future exploits, and that the expedition had become a blatant black stain on his record.To make matters worse, the Wicked Forest Expedition was something he’d put together without the king’s permission. He ignored the bureaucracy and acted entirely of his own accord. If he’d succeeded, he would have been able to brush off the resulting criticism by emphasizing his newfound achievements. But he did not. And so, he was prone to blame and punishment. His crime was so grave that he would have been court martialed had he not been a prince. Fortunately, his status allowed him to escape conviction, but that didn’t mean he was scot-free. Some sort of punishment was inevitable if his actions and their consequences were ever brought to light.Riutt had no choice but to somehow make up for his failure. If he didn’t, his name would remain sullied, and his reputation smeared with mud. The nobles wouldn’t obey him, even after he inherited his father’s throne.“What now, my lord?” The only other individual in the prince’s office raised his voice. “The expedition’s failure was likely due to a lack of personnel. We’ll need to send an even larger group if we wish to succeed, but it doesn’t look like we can. His Majesty will likely catch wind of our actions if we do.”
“I fucking know already goddamnit! I don’t need you reminding me.” The prince’s immediate reaction was to shout, but he realized that losing his temper wouldn’t be to his benefit, so he took a deep breath and calmed himself before continuing. “If quantity isn’t an option, then we’ll have to resort to using quality instead. Why don’t we employ that one group of orichalcum class adventurers?”
“With all due respect, Your Highness, that isn’t possible. They’ve already been placed on another task. I doubt any adventurers weaker than them will work either, seeing as how our foe was capable of crushing an entire army.”
“Damn it.” The prince clicked his tongue. “Fine, then let’s use that.”
“That, your majesty?”
“I’m talking about the thing the church’s been boasting about lately.”
“You mean to say the hero? I believe it hasn’t finished its training yet. The church is likely willing to lend it to us regardless, but I’m sure it’ll demand quite the amount of compensation in return.”
“Feh,” scoffed the prince. “Those greedy misers. They call themselves ‘god’s vassals,’ but they’re as hungry for gold as the most avaricious of merchants. Fine. We’ll reel them in by flashing them a cut of the profits.”
“If that is your will, then so it shall be, Your Highness.”***“Ugh…Why am I here again?”The hero sighed as she pushed herself to continue moving through the undergrowth.Her name was Nell. She was a young girl that’d formerly lived in a village out in the boonies. She’d always thought of herself as an average girl, but one fateful day, that’d all changed. A man claiming to be one of the church’s priests had showed up at her doorstep and informed her she was qualified to become a hero.Nell’s excitement shot through the roof in an instant. Her mother had always told her tales of heroes, of how they used their blessed powers to rid the world of evil and calamity. The many folk and fairy tales she heard about them had led her to develop a deep admiration of their craft. Becoming a hero would not only let her help people, but also make things easier on her mother. She had no father, so Nell’s mother had slaved away, overworking herself day in and day out in order to raise her.The combination of her circumstances and her respect for heroes had led her to be enthralled by the priest’s words. She immediately accepted his offer and took up the hero’s mantle. The days that followed were filled with naught but hellish, grueling training. She would train with the knight order until she was utterly exhausted before moving on to listening to an old court mage ramble on and on about magic. His lectures were so “fascinating” that they threatened to almost magically force her into the land of dreams. It took everything she had to resist the urge and continue listening.Nell was confident that the relentless training she’d been put through had toughened her up, and that the church was finally sending her out on a mission because they recognized her abilities. Frankly, she was happy. She was glad that all her hard work had finally been acknowledged.The mission was for her to eliminate a man-slaying demon that lived within the depths of a forest. It was her first job, so she was pumped, especially since the church had provided her a full set of equipment.“Gegyaagyaaaa!”
“W-what was that!?”Nell took up a stance as a large bird took to the skies somewhere nearby. Her training had clearly paid off; the action was entirely unconscious. But that said, Nell wasn’t exactly what one could call composed. In fact, she was exactly the opposite.Her voice had clearly indicated that she was on the verge of breaking into tears. She lacked the mental fortitude to deal with her current situation. Nell had been named a hero, but the truth of the matter was that she was still just an ordinary girl at heart.<– Prev — Next –>

A Portrayal of The Average Hero“One here, one there, oh, one off in that corner would be good too…”I tapped at the menu over and over as I placed a series of traps throughout the castle. I was remodeling and transforming it into an impregnable fortress that none would ever conquer. A good number of the traps I set were ones provided by the dungeon, but that wasn’t all. I also made use of a few of tricks and devices I came up with on my own.My focus, which had lasted quite a while, was suddenly interrupted by the map. It popped out of nowhere and shoved itself in my face. All my attention was immediately drawn to the blinking red blip currently located at the very edge of my territory.The dungeon had once again been subject to an invasion. I promptly tapped the blip in order to get the map to show a few more details, only to find that the humans had changed their approach.***

Chronic Yes-Man***The humans had acted again. But this time, they sent only a single individual: a hero.“Huh… so heroes really do exist.”The hero’s stats clearly deviated far from the norm. She was much more powerful than all the other humans that had ever entered the dungeon. Her skills looked fairly solid as well. Her holy magic was a cut above the rest; it was already level five. As a demon lord, and thereby presumably some sort of unholy creation, I was almost certain that a text box would appear below me and claim that the attack was “super effective” the moment I was struck by any sort of holy spell. [1]Wait, is that a whole thousand luck? Holy shit. God damn. That hero needs to go hit up a casino or something.“Still though, a hero…? Talk about lame.” I laughed dryly as I began to grumble and complain.The hero was slowly but surely moving deeper into my territory, so I made use of the many evil eyes I had strewn throughout my territory and began to observe her. Her advance was cautious, and the girl herself almost seemed kind of timid. Her hair was cut short and styled like a bob, so at first glance, I’d almost thought that she was male, but her figure was clearly that of a girl’s.It was clear that the humans had sent her as an alternative to yet another army. They’d chosen to go with quality over quantity because the opposite approach had failed.Holy shit, are the humans retarded? Did they really not think to send anyone else with her at all? What the hell are their higher ups thinking?I almost wanted to sigh as I realized that the girl really was all alone. She didn’t have a party, nor any other sort of support.Like seriously, what the hell? Is this supposed to be one of those historical dramas where a battle is decided by a duel between a pair of generals? Or maybe some sort of masochistic nuzlocke? Like, why? Just why? Whoever sent her here has to be short a few brain cells.Though I was sure that there was some underlying reason that the hero was here all by herself, I still couldn’t help but find it stupid, in part because I was never really one to like heroes to begin with. I’d always found the very concept of a hero to be ridiculous.Heroes were, in essence, people out to save the world. They obey orders and fight on many a battlefield all under the guise of carrying out some sort of epic quest. They save all the people they come across almost as if it were a mechanical response hardcoded into their systems.To be frank, I found heroism absolutely fucking ridiculous. I didn’t see the point in spending my life serving the general populace.I very much preferred being a demon lord. Because unlike heroes, demon lords were free. I didn’t have to bend to the whims of another. I could openly detest those that I hated, seek revenge whenever I desired it, expand my territory as I wished, and effectively live however I pleased. I was the only thing holding myself back, and I was the only thing that could stop myself from living a life free of regrets. I knew that living however I pleased was sure to inconvenience other people, but that was fine. I would much rather cause trouble than lament my own decisions.There was no denying that I was a self-centered prick, but it was also precisely because I was so selfish that I didn’t mind casting my humanity aside. Though my race had changed, I was still me. I didn’t particularly care how I looked so long as the essence that made up my being remained unchanged.Actually… I take that back. I’d probably panic if I ended up becoming something that didn’t even look remotely human. At the very least, I’d like to have a somewhat humanoid silhouette.It was likely precisely that part of my mentality that led the dungeon to believe that I was suited to becoming a demon lord.Anyway, if it’s a fight the hero wants, then it’ll be a fight she gets. The castle’s a bit shy of complete, but it still does have a good number of traps, and nasty ones too. Might as well have her give them a bit of a test run. Anyway, I better go tell everyone to hide before she gets here.I spread my wings, leapt out the castle, and began gliding towards the courtyard, where all the dungeon’s other residents had gathered for some sort of tea party.“Hey! Listen up!”I yelled to grab their attention as I used my wings to slowly descend. The second pair I’d gotten had boosted my control. I was now much more stable and could both position myself in midair and land as softly as I wanted, wherever I wanted. I no longer had to freefall and plunge myself into the earth to come to a stop.That said, I often did so regardless when I went hunting with Rir. My high altitude strikes were not only effective, but also thrilling and fun to use, so I decided to keep employing them even though they had become less of a necessity.“What is it, Yuki?”
“How about not trying to touch my wings the moment you see them…”I couldn’t help but smile wryly as Lefi dashed up to me and began feeling me up. There wasn’t really much of a point in stopping her, as she probably wouldn’t listen to me, so I began to talk while letting her do as she pleased.“A hero’s entered the dungeon. You guys might want to head back over to the true throne room and hang around there for a bit while I handle things.”
“Oh gawd! Didja just say a hero, Master!?” The first to react was Lyuu. Her face immediately contorted in displeasure.
“I’m guessing you know what heroes are then?”
“‘Course I do!” said Lyuu. “They’re cold blooded murderers, and strong as heck too! Most of ‘em get trained when they’re just kids, so they all kinda think it’s right to kill us non-humans on sight.”
“I see…” I said as I narrowed my gaze.Lyuu’s interpretation made plenty of sense. It was only natural for those that opposed humanity to think of their heroes as the stuff of nightmares.I remember hearing something like that in my previous life too. A hero in one country could be classified a criminalized mass murderer in another, and for the exact same deeds at that.“Yeah, so one of those uh ‘cold blooded murderers’ is headed right for us. I should be able to get rid of them without too much issue, but you still might want to get out of here just in case.”
“Okay!” replied Illuna.
“A hero? How curious. I am feeling rather tempted to ask for permission to observe it,” added Leila.
“T-That ain’t much of a good idea, Leila. Y’know, curiosity killed the cat ‘n stuff.”Illuna and the maids entered a hidden door located in one of the courtyard’s corners and retreated to the true throne room. Of course, I wasn’t stupid enough to place a door that would put the dungeon’s residents, myself included, in danger. The door in the courtyard was one of the many anywh*re doors I’d set up around the castle’s grounds. [2]I used to be the one that could select and modify the door’s destination, but leveling the dungeon had caused that to change. Anyone could have the ability to redirect the door so long as I permitted them to do so.In other words, the doors served as portals that could take the dungeon’s residents almost wherever they wanted. They were extremely convenient.“And you are sure that you need not my aid?” said Lefi. Unlike the other three, she had stayed behind.
“Nah, don’t worry about it. This is pretty much the perfect chance for me to test the castle’s defenses. You might as well sit back, find yourself a snack, and watch as I wrap everything up.”
“Very well… But do not forget that I am more than willing to offer you my assistance if need be.”
“Yeah, I know. Don’t worry, I’ll ask you for help if I really need it. I think I’ll be fine though, all I’m planning to do is activate a few traps while sitting around in the throne room. I doubt I’ll be in any real danger,” I said with a smile.And so, Lefi and I returned to the throne room as I prepared to engage the hero.[1] Pokemon[2] Doraemon<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Assault“What… is that?”Nell continued advancing through the wicked forest until she arrived at a massive, gaping cave. Though the cave stood in the shadows of a steep cliff, it still somehow stood out to her. It appeared much darker than everything else around it, as if it was swallowing all the light in its vicinity and funneling it into some sort of deep abyss.“Wait!” The hero’s eyes shot open as she came to understand the cave’s identity. “That’s a dungeon!” She immediately drew Durandal, her holy sword, from the expensive-looking leather sheath on her waist. A single glance was enough to tell that the item was made by a highly skilled craftsman—it was both a beautiful work of art and as functional a scabbard as could be.Durandal’s faint, familiar glow was comforting. It mitigated her anxiety; seeing it allowed her to calm herself down.Nell was already aware that her target was likely a demon lord, a dungeon master. One of the church’s knights had filled her in on the details while handing down her orders. She was told that the demon she’d been tasked with killing was formidable. He lived in the Wicked Forest; his continued survival indicated that he was at least capable of fending off the powerful monsters that made it their home. The knight had mentioned that he probably lived near, but not in the Supreme Dragon’s territory, and that she should retreat if she encounter any foe that proved too powerful for her to defeat. She had even been provided a magic-imbued tool for that exact purpose.Unfortunately for her, Nell’s grasp on the status quo was lacking. It was both skewed and just flat out wrong. Raylow, Alfyro’s lord, had seen the demon first hand and confirmed that he was a demon lord, but since he was opposed to the expedition, he had failed to fill all the expedition forces in on all the details. All the reports he sent were half assed and lacked any real information.Nell’s only reliable source of information was the man that’d been removed from his position, the former commander of the Allysian Knight Order. He testified that the rest of the expedition force had likely been annihilated by a single male demon. The former knight captain’s report was detailed, but as he had retreated, he never witnessed the slaughter firsthand. There was no confirmation that the demon was as powerful as he seemed. Moreover, unlike Raylow, the former knight didn’t know that the demon was linked to the Supreme Dragon.Unlike the prince, who sat at the top of the chain of command, the majority of those that served under him knew that the Supreme Dragon was no myth. Most of those in charge of military affairs knew that it acted exactly as described in the legends. It attacked everything that invaded its territory. The combination of that bit of knowledge and the fact that the demon was still alive was more than enough for Allysia’s officers to infer that he likely lived outside the innermost sanctum. They were convinced that there was no way for him to survive an encounter with the dragon of which the legends were sung, regardless of how powerful he was.“A-Alright, I guess this is it!” Nell nervously gulped.A wave of cold air enveloped her as she stepped into the cave. Every single step she took echoed back to her and assaulted her ears with an unpleasant ring.The cave was silent, too silent. Dungeons were supposed to contain monsters, but Nell had yet to meet even a single one. Her surroundings were so devoid of life that she found them eerie and sinister; a heavy sense of anxiety assaulted her being.Though she felt uneasy, Nell pushed on until she arrived at the end of the cave and found a sort of door. The only word she could use to describe it was unnatural. It stood out from everything else around it; it was almost like it was artificial.Nell immediately raised her guard. She inspected the door because she was concerned that it was laced with some sort of trap, but she couldn’t find anything no matter how hard she looked, so she ended up timidly placing her hand on the doorknob and giving it a twist. She then slowly pushed it open and looked beyond.“Woah…”An inadvertent sigh of admiration leaked from her mouth as her eyes fell upon the grassy plain that lay behind the out of place entranceway. Both it and the sky above it extended as far as the eye could see.It was almost like the door she’d entered was a gate into another world. What lay beyond was so far outside her expectations that it caused her to feel a sense of malaise. The part that stood out most, the single thing that left the biggest impression on her, was the massive black castle that stood at its centre.The moment she looked upon it was the moment it burned itself into her memory. Its sheer size was overwhelming; the bulky, jet black structure looked to be at least twice the size of Allysia’s royal castle. She didn’t understand how, but gazing at it caused her to feel both disgust and appreciation. She was put off by the blackness of its material, but entranced by its beauty. The longer she stared, the hotter her chest burned.“Amazing…”She continued observing the castle for a few moments before finally snapping back to reality. She shook her head back and forth a few times to rid herself of any unnecessary thoughts and forced herself to focus on the task at hand.Nell finally began to understand that her hypothesis was correct. The cave really had been the dungeon’s entrance. The reason she’d yet to be attacked was because it was just the prelude. Only now that she’d stepped through the door was the dungeon’s master finally going to get serious.She tightened her grip on her holy blade all the more as she narrowed her eyes, surveyed her surroundings, and advanced towards the castle’s giant black gates.***I couldn’t help but grin as I watched the hero stare down my castle.“What manner of slovenly expression is that supposed to be?”
“Iunno what you’re talking about.”Lefi’s sharp glare caused me to return to my senses, so I quickly cleared my throat to cover it up. The dragon girl had recently christened the castle Luan Fionell Castle. According to her, the words meant “One that Reigns Supreme” in dragon tongue.It was a good name; it made the castle seem even more impressive and majestic than it already was.“Yuki…” Though I’d denied Lefi’s claim, her gaze remained sharp. “It appears as though you’ve no intention of ending the girl’s life.”
“Uh… what makes you think that?”
“One look at you is all I require to see that you lack the drive. I’ve witnessed what it is like for you to lust for blood, and the difference is immediately apparent.”
“I mean, you said it yourself, so…”
“What? I fail to follow.”
“She’s a girl.”Though I declared that I would slay all my enemies, I didn’t feel like killing the hero. Killing a woman was something that I knew would weigh on my conscience. I was more than capable of killing men in cold blood, but I couldn’t bring myself to do the same to a young girl. That was simply how I’d started feeling about humans ever since coming to this world. To be exact, the rule applied to more than just humans. I felt the same way about everyone else that I didn’t have a sort of pre-existing emotional investment in as well.I’d long decided that I would kill those I wanted to kill and avoid killing those I didn’t. Since the hero happened to fall into the latter of the two categories, I decided to avoid activating my deadlier traps. I instead chose to focus on non-lethal ones that would slowly but surely deprive her of her will to fight.“Damned pervert…” said Lefi, as she pinched my arm.
“Ouch! T-That’s not what I mean! L-Like, she only looks just a little bit older than you, you know? Isn’t it natural to hesitate about killing a girl that young?”I spat out excuses in a hurry.“Hmph…” Lefi twisted her expression into a pout. “Very well, do as you wish. But do know that I will not forgive you if you find yourself in peril as a result of this decision.”
“I-It’ll be fine. I’m pretty confident in the traps I have set up. Just kick back, relax, and watch. You’ll see what I mean.”I tried to cheer Lefi up and point her towards the video feed, but my efforts were to no avail. She just ended up glaring at me all the more.<– Prev — Next –>

The Fear Mongering DungeonNell nervously cast her gaze to and fro as she moved through the castle. In examining her surroundings, she found herself face to face with many a gloomy corridor. They were dim and somber, but she felt that they were majestic nonetheless. The light coming off the brilliant chandeliers refracted off the magnificent pillars lining the corridors to create a series of dark, intimidating shadows. Though she felt threatened by her surroundings, the hero thought them to be elegant, sophisticated, and refined. The ambiance couldn’t be described any other way.Her enemy search skill had failed to produce any sort of reaction whatsoever, but Nell remained cautious nonetheless. She knew that she couldn’t let her guard down so deep in enemy territory, regardless of what her skill was telling her. But that was only half the truth. The hero’s education was only one of the two reasons she remained vigilant. To be frank, Nell was only as on guard as she was because the castle had her spooked. There were a countless number of armoured statues placed throughout the hall at even intervals. The stone monuments were so well crafted and lifelike that she was worried they might awaken and assault her at any given moment. And though they too were made of sculpted stone, the realistic blades the suits of armour were holding really didn’t help.No matter how hard she tried, the hero could not help but be creeped out by the eerie decorations. She felt as if they were staring at her, that something lay within the dark slits of their helmets.Nell really didn’t want to keep pushing forward. She was frightened. She wanted to turn around and head home, but she couldn’t. The hero was already far too deep in the enemy’s territory for her to turn tail and run. Reluctantly, she continued to advance. But before she did, she first spun around to inspect her surroundings.“H-Huh…?” She blinked in surprise. “Did they just…?”Nell was struck with a sudden sense of foreboding as she realized that the statues behind her seemed to be looking right at her. It was as if they’d turned their helmets towards her the moment she took her eyes off them.“I’m probably just imagining things. That has to be it.” She gulped as she tried to reassure herself. “There aren’t any monsters around, so there’s no way they weren’t like that before, right…?”After once again attempting to convince herself that nothing was wrong, Nell turned back around—only to see one of the suits of armour right behind her.“Kyaaahh!?”She swung her blade as she screamed. The instincts that’d been beaten into her body allowed her to deliver a splendid diagonal slash despite being caught off guard. Her blade smoothly glided through the statue’s torso, bisecting it without even the slightest bit of resistance. The top half of the stone sculpture glided off the bottom; a heavy thud resounded through the corridor as it crashed into the floor.“G-Geez… How the heck did that get there…?”Nell nervously stole a peek inside the armoured shell and confirmed that it was empty, completely devoid of life or force. A shiver ran up her spine. The lack of a perpetrator rendered the hero confused and terrified.The uncanny scenario left her wanting to flee, so she sped up her steps in an attempt to get out the corridor as soon as possible. She moved through the long hall, passing armoured statue after armoured statue. It took awhile, but she eventually managed to reach a bend, a route of escape.“Huh…?”But as she turned the corner, she once again realized that something was amiss. The new corridor she entered, like the last, was lined with stone statues. A single bisected one was standing in the middle of the hall. It didn’t take more than a moment for her to realize what had happened. She’d failed to escape. She’d only gone full circle despite advancing in what had seemed to be a straight line.“Aieee!” A high pitched shriek forced its way out from the hero’s throat as she recoiled in fear.As if using her scream as their impetus, the hall’s doors began slamming open one after another. Bizarre sounding groans leaked out from within.“AaaaAAaaaAAAaaahhHHhhh…”
“GugieAaagigiagiea….”
“GURUaruRUARUrururu…”Nell’s heart pounded. She was so terrified that her breaths ran both ragged and shallow. She took a step backwards in order to get away from whatever was about to come out of the doors. But to no avail; the step she took ran her into something. Once again, there was something right behind her.The hero’s entire body stiffened.A part of her was screaming at her and urging her not to look, but she ignored it and fearfully reared her head. The first thing that entered her line of sight as she turned around was a large tooth.It took her a second to understand what she was looking at. It was a woman. Or rather, least a woman’s face, many times larger than life and floating right behind her. The sides of the woman’s cheeks were torn open. And visible through the skin was an abnormally large jaw. The “woman’s” massive mouth was gaping open, as if to readily swallow the hero whole.“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!”Nell screamed. A shrill cry echoed throughout the entire castle, reaching every last nook and cranny despite its massive size.***“Ahahaha!” Watching the dungeon’s video feed caused me to slap my knee as I laughed. “Oh man, I can’t believe she actually fell for that.”As the person responsible for setting all the dungeon’s traps, I was glad to see them prove their worth. All the time and energy I spent placing them hadn’t been put to waste.I felt as if I was starting to understand why demon lords had the tendency to greet their foes while pumped full of magnanimity. It was clearly because watching their carefully placed traps succeed brought them glee. It was only natural for a demon lord to be in a good mood by the time the heroes finally reached them. That said, my case was a bit different in the sense that I wasn’t actually using traps. All the events that had played out on my display had been orchestrated by the dungeon’s monsters. Specifically, it was the work of my three newest hires. The reason the pranks so greatly resembled the actions of a poltergeist was because that was exactly what they were.All three of the creatures I’d summoned were ghosts. Or more specifically, wraiths. Wraiths were monsters that had no true physical form. They were translucent; you could almost see right through them. I named the three ghost-like monsters I’d recently summoned Rei, Rui, and Lowe. For some odd reason, all three of them were girls, and ones that looked to be between 3 and 4 years old at that. Just to be clear, I hadn’t planned on them being young girls. In fact, I would’ve preferred that they weren’t. I was a bit concerned that Lefi would start with her accusations again, and as I was by no means a pedophile, I really didn’t like to be referred to as one.Appearances aside, all three wraiths were everything I’d hoped they’d be. Each had a skill they specialized in. Rei was good at telekinesis. She was responsible for slamming the doors and moving all the armour.Lowe was good at mind magic; her spells were specialized to alter the target’s perception of reality by manipulating their senses. Although it was powerful, mind magic was also extremely limited in its use. It was more or less incapable of affecting individuals whose mental states were undisturbed. Fortunately, the hero had been totally spooked and on edge, so she made for an easy target. Lowe had managed to make a rectangular set of corridors appear like a single straight hallway. In other words, she had made the hero walk a full circle without realizing it.Last but not least was Rui. Her illusion magic allowed her to create both the creepy sounding groans and the woman with the needlessly large mouth. The most amazing part about Rui’s magic was that it had substance. You could feel the apparitions she created even though they didn’t actually exist.Wraiths were classified as undead monsters. Most wraiths were thought of as creatures that hated the living, but neither Rei, Rui, or Lowe had any homicidal impulses. Unlike most other wraiths, they hadn’t become wraiths after basking in some sort of grudge. Their forms weren’t composed of the pure malice left behind by a poor soul’s remorse-filled dying wish. They were much more pure. They did desire to prank the living, but that was it.And that was why the hero was unable to detect them. Her enemy search skill functioned by seeking out those that wished to harm her. The three wraiths had no such intent. All they wanted to do was play with her. As far as the skill was concerned, the three wraith girls were not her enemies. If I was her, I would’ve been able to cope with the situation by opening up my map and inspecting the area around me. But unlike me, the hero wasn’t a demon lord. She couldn’t access the dungeon’s features. She had no way of finding the creatures tormenting her.The three wraiths cost a pretty penny. I had to go out of my way to not only save up the DP I passively gained, but also go hunting with Rir just to stock up enough to summon them. The verdict? They were well worth the expense. I decided to name the current non-lethal setup the dungeon’s “haunted house mode.” I’d already thought up several other defensive configurations as well, but I’d yet to iron out the details of the “surekill mode.” That part was still on the drawing board.Heh. This is getting pretty fun. Man, I do love me some good old tower defense. I grinned as I continued observing the hero. Apparently, my sentiments weren’t shared, as Lefi, who was sitting nearby, turned towards me with an exasperated look on her face.“What a hopeless deviant you are… It appalls me to find that you are not only a pedophile, but also a sadist.”
“Oh come on, stop that. You’re making me sound like some sort of twisted pervert.”
“That is exactly the point.”I wanted to refute Lefi’s claim, but Illuna, who was sitting between the two of us, joined in on the conversation and cut me off before I could respond.“I feel kinda bad for her. You’re being really mean and bullying her lots…” The young vampire’s gaze was painful. She was clearly finding fault with my actions.
“W-Well I mean, I get what you’re saying, but she’s kind of our enemy, you know…?” I raised a finger and pointed it towards the screen the hero was displayed on, only to find that the situation had changed since I last looked. The three wraiths had left the poor girl traumatized; she had clearly already lost the will to continue. In fact, she was huddled off in a corner, cradling her knees and sobbing.“Uhh…” I wanted to keep talking, but I couldn’t. My point had already been proven moot.
“Yuki…” said Lefi.
“I think you should really stop bullying her…” added Illuna.Both their gazes were reproachful. Neither believed that I was in the right.“Alright, alright, I get it, so stop looking at me like that already.” I sighed.Unable to stand their stares, I hurriedly escaped from the true throne room and started heading towards the hero’s location. She had already lost the will to fight, so I doubted that she would attack me even if I met her face to face.Man, what a bummer. I guess all that planning the wraiths and I went through is just going to end up going to waste…<– Prev — Next –>

First Contact With The Hero
Translator: SupremeTentacle
Editor: JokerThe first thing I saw after entering the designated corridor was a young girl huddled in one of its corners, her head buried in her knees. It was immediately apparent that she’d been crying, sobbing in fear. The girl lacked the valiant, brave nature one would expect of a hero. I failed to understand why the church had sent someone so cowardly. I could see that she was much stronger than the average human, but her faint-hearted nature rendered her strength moot. That said, I very much preferred dealing with a coward over some sort of war-crazed battle maniac.“So uh… Hi.”
“O-Oh no! Not again!” The hero responded to my greeting by attempting to shrink into the corner. She tightened her grip on her knees and shivered upon hearing my voice. She was so terrified that she couldn’t even bring herself to raise her head and look at me. I had to change my approach.I crouched, lowering my body until my face was level with hers before speaking in a bit of a softer tone. “It’s okay. Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to hurt or scare you,” I said. “I’m uh… actually a living thing.”Hearing me call out to her again caused the hero to fearfully raise her head. Her face was swollen and her eyes were red. She’d sobbed quite a bit.“Uhm, who are you, mister?”
“Well… it’d probably be better for me not to say. For both our sakes.”The hero regarded me with a bit of a dubious expression. She seemed to want to raise a few questions, but her face paled in dread before she could.“W-Watch out mister! T-there’s something behind you!” She raised a finger and pointed at the objects floating above my shoulders.
“Oh, don’t mind them.” I shrugged as I turned to face the three dolls hovering around me. Each was shaped like a young girl. “Thanks girls. You did great. Your job is done, so feel free to go do whatever.” I gave each doll a light pat on the head as I dismissed them from their duties.They responded by happily giggling and floating away. The three human shaped toys were, of course, each possessed by one of the three wraiths. I’d given them the dolls because I felt it more convenient for them to have physical form.“Did you just give those monsters orders? W-Wait, that means you’re the demon lord!”The hero drew the sword hanging off her waist and held it out in front of her. The blade was decorated with many a beautiful engraving, but because the hero was still sitting with her butt planted on the floor, neither she nor the sword in her hand seemed to possess much in the way of dignity. Needless to say, her tear-stained excuse for a glare didn’t help either.A quick glance at the weapon was enough for me to discern that it was dangerous. It was enchanted with some sort of effect that prevented me from performing a detailed analysis. All I was able to learn was that it was a holy sword. And as such, it likely had some sort of bonus effect in the presence of evil. A part of me suspected that it would do double damage against demon lords and their ilk.“Yeah, I am, but can we not do the whole combat thing? Iunno about you, but I’ve got no intention of fighting someone that just got done crying and whimpering.”
“I-I wasn’t crying!”
“Yeah uh… sure. I totally believe you.”
“Mmrrphh…” The hero responded to my exasperated comment with an indignant groan before following up with an angry complaint. “T-Then why the heck did you have to mess with me!?”
“I mean, think about it. Some random stranger walks into your house all armed and shit. Chasing said stranger out is only common sense. That said, I didn’t think that you’d have a total mental breakdown. Really wasn’t expecting the tears.”The orders I gave my wraiths were actually quite specific. I told them to leave her alone and let her head home if she decided to turn tail and run.“Well… I guess I can kinda see what you mean,” said the hero. “B-But there weren’t any tears! I wasn’t crying!”
“Yeah, yeah, okay, I get it,” I rolled my eyes. “But either way, leave this place. Go home. You being here is making it hard for me to go about my business.”We couldn’t even do the laundry with her around; the maids couldn’t exactly go around hanging clothes out to dry with a monster girl slaying hero on the loose.“I-I can’t!” declared the hero.
“Why not?”
“You’ll start attacking innocent people again if I leave you alone!”Ugh… what a pain in the ass. Why did I think talking to her would be a good idea again?“And who exactly are these ‘innocent people’ you’re referring to? Are you talking about the criminals I killed when I visited the city? Or maybe the armed force that came to take my head?” Again, I rolled my eyes. “Just sayin’, I didn’t instigate either of those two scenarios. You guys attacked me first both times. All I did was retaliate. Don’t you think it’s kind of ridiculous to judge me for responding to violence in kind?”While I did technically launch a preemptive attack on the army, it was still a case of legitimate self defense. They had infringed on my territory with weapons in hand. It was clear that they were some sort of punitive force.“Well… uhmmm…”The hero was at a loss. I didn’t even need to look at the expression on her face to tell that she knew not the truth behind the incidents I was involved in. It was only natural for the country to hide the details from her if they worked against their interests. That was just what countries did.“You are far too naive,” I said. “You can’t just swallow what your higher ups tell you if you truly wish to help people in need and save those in peril. You need to think about the scenarios you’re exposed to. You have to come up with your own opinions and then act on them. Of course, that applies to what I’m telling you right now too. Don’t just swallow it and interpret it as the truth. Digest it.”My tone was condescending. I spoke to her like a know-it-all despite being the furthest thing from a hero there was. I had no right to lecture her. I had no intention of ever doing the whole hero thing. And even if I did, I wouldn’t do it out of the goodness of my heart. I would demand tremendous amounts of wealth, fame, and status for each heroic action I undertook. Though the demands were sure to earn the ire of many, I didn’t care. If I was going to put my life on the line, then it would have to be for my own sake. I saw no reason to risk dying for nothing but the benefit of others.To be frank, self-interest was precisely what had fueled all my actions to date. Taken to the logical extreme, one could even say that the act of saving Illuna was something that I’d done entirely for myself. I chose to rescue her because I didn’t want to see her go, because I didn’t want her to suffer, because I didn’t want her to end up as some asshole’s slave. It was all for me.I only helped people for my sake. My desire to lend them a hand was something born within me. My actions were selfish. I only chose to execute them for the sake of self-satisfaction. And I knew I wasn’t the only one.My understanding of my own selfish nature was precisely why I hated people who posed as saints. I absolutely detested the two-faced assholes that claimed they wished to help others from the bottom of their hearts, people that “believed” that their actions stemmed entirely from goodwill. They disgusted me. I hated the fact that they didn’t just admit that they were helping people for their own fulfillment and satisfaction.“So yeah, that’s pretty much how it is.” I frowned. “It’s not like I hate humans in particular. I wouldn’t go out of my way to attack them without reason, but of course, I don’t feel the same way about my enemies. Tell your higher ups that I’ll annihilate anyone that opposes me without exception or mercy.”
“But then… why?”I stood up with my declaration and got ready to leave, but the hero stopped me before I could.“Why what?”
“Why didn’t you kill me? Didn’t I technically oppose you?”
“Oh, that? That’s just ’cause you’re a girl.”
“Huh…?” The hero’s jaw dropped.
“There are two reasons I let you live. The first is that you’re a girl. The second is that you’re still just a kid. Killing you would leave a bad taste in my mouth, so I didn’t. That’s all there is to it.”
“S-So it’s just because I’m a girl…? Wait! Did you just call me a kid!? I’m not a kid!”
“I understand, milady. I am sorry, I was mistaken.” I gave her an exaggerated apology before spinning around so that I could actually leave.
“W-Wait! Hold on!”But again, she stopped me.“What is it this time…?”
“M-My hips gave out so I can’t get back up. Could you help me to my feet?”
“…”The hero not only revealed her weakness to me, but also asked for my help despite the fact that she’d been antagonizing me only a few moments prior. Her behaviour was so bold and outlandish that it scrambled my brain. I could no longer tell if she was gutsy, cowardly, or just plain naive.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero Takes a Bath
Translator: SupremeTentacle
Editor: JokerA soothing warmth enveloped Nell’s body as she slowly sank into the water. The sensation was so calming and relaxing that it caused her to inadvertently leak a sigh. Above her shone a perfect replica of the starry sky outdoors. Both it and the gentle light it emitted felt so real that she almost couldn’t bring herself to believe it to be fake.It had been a long time since she took her last bath. She never had the opportunity to back home. The church had provided her with a few chances, but none of their baths had been anywhere near as luxurious as the one she was in now.As embarrassing as it was to admit, Nell had been so scared that she lost all strength in her hips. She couldn’t move or get up. The only reason she was no longer plopped on the ground was because the demon lord had lent her his shoulder. Speaking of which, the demon lord had offered to let her stay the night. It was already late, and she’d already been defeated once, so Nell ended up going with the flow and accepting. And so, he led her over to a building that resembled a hot spring resort and ushered her inside. That was how she’d suddenly ended up shoulders deep in warm bathwater.Reflecting on the demon lord’s actions caused her to frown. The church’s description of him was completely inaccurate. Her superiors had made him out to be the type of evil overlord often seen in fairy tales. They called him a savage with many a victim buried in his wake. Her expectations had been set up in a way that completely failed to reflect what she thought to be the demon lord’s nature. After actually meeting him, she came to realize that he gave off a “guy next door” kinda vibe. He was a bit older than her and has his quirks, but all in all, he was casual and friendly. The attitude he faced her with reminded her of a neighbour.She had taken up a stance upon discovering that he was a demon lord, but only because of her preconceptions. The man had never shown any hostility or ill will. His friendly intentions were only further evidenced by both his actions and the hero’s own skillset. Her enemy detection skill failed to identify him as a foe, and he had gone as far as to offer her a piece of advice.You have to come up with your own opinions and act on them. Don’t just swallow what other people tell you and interpret it as the truth. Digest it.His words continued to run through her head even to this very moment. It was as if he’d etched them right into her brain.Nell had never acted on her own choices before. She had always remained obedient and strived to be the good girl. Back when she lived at home, she treated her mom’s wishes as her highest priority. She knew that her mother worked as hard as she could to raise her, so she tried her best not to cause her any further trouble.Likewise, she did everything the church had asked of her as well. Her desire to become a full-fledged hero as soon as possible had driven her to receive their orders with naught but obedience. She listened to the knight’s words, memorized the priests’ preachings, and even sat through the old mage’s lectures while paying as much attention as she possibly could. She never showed even the slightest hint of defiance.The demon lord’s words led Nell to realize that she was just a puppet. Subservience was so deeply ingrained in her lifestyle that obeying orders had become second nature. She never thought for herself. She’d always just let everyone else pull her strings.None of the heroes Nell had always looked up to had been anywhere near as subservient as her. In fact, they were often exactly the opposite. They were their own bosses. They moved without instruction to eliminate evil, regardless of whether or not it had already come to light.“Where did I go wrong…?”The hero frowned as she thought over the steps she took to reach her current position, but stopped as she heard the door rattle open. Her body immediately responded by rising out of the water and taking a defensive stance, but the strength drained from her body as she realized that the person that’d entered was just a young girl.“Huh…?” The blonde haired girl tilted her head as she regarded the hero. “Oh! You’re the girl my brother was bullying!”
“I-I’d really prefer you didn’t think of me like that…” Nell slumped forwards, depressed. “Wait! You were watching!?”The hero couldn’t help but shout her question. The little girl that she’d never once seen in her life somehow knew of the trials and tribulations she’d just experienced.“Er… U-Uhm… So what’s your name?”After realizing what she’d done, Nell coughed and faked clearing her throat in order to dispel the awkward atmosphere before continuing with a question.“I’m Illuna! What’s yours?”
“I’m Nell. Nice to meet you, Illuna.”
“Yup! It’s nice to meet you too, Nell!”The adorable, doll-like girl sat herself down in front of a wash bin and hastily began to clean her body. Seeing her act caused the rest of Nell’s tension to leave her. Understanding that there was no danger, Nell allowed herself to sink back into the bath.“Wait, did you just call the demon lord your brother?”
“Yup! We’re not related, but he’s like a big brother to me.”Oh, so she just calls him that because she’s attached to him. Nell nodded to herself before addressing the little girl and asking one of the questions that’d been on her mind since she first met him.“Say, Illuna.”
“Yeah?”
“Uhm… What kind of person is your big brother anyway?”
“I’m super glad you asked!” The little girl’s eyes sparkled as she responded to the question with unexpected fervor. “He’s super cool! He saved my life! He plays with me all the time and makes sure I don’t get lonely! I really love him! He acts kinda silly sometimes, but I like that part of him too. It’s really cute!”
“I-I see.” Taken aback by the little girl’s excited response, Nell could only nod along as she listened.Just why is this little girl so attached to the demon lord? Could it be that he sometimes craves children?“Has the demon lord ever touched you anywhere weird?”
“Nope! But he does act kinda weird. Sometimes, he’ll suddenly start shouting about something while bursting out of his room and running off somewhere.”
“O-Oh. So he’s just weird?”Illuna’s description of the demon lord left the hero confused. She didn’t understand him at all. The encounter led Nell to lose sight of what demon lords were. The image of the stereotypical evil mastermind she had built up throughout her life had totally crumbled away.***“And what, precisely, are you plotting this time?” Lefi crossed her arms as she regarded me with a piercing glare.
“Nothing, really.” I responded with a casual shrug. “She’s not set on attacking us anymore, and it’s already late. We have a crap ton of extra rooms, so there isn’t really any reason not to lend her one. Plus, I’ve been meaning to learn more about the humans, and this is as good a chance as any.”
“I see. So you intentionally created a set of circumstances such that you would have all the excuses you needed to rope yet another girl into your ‘dungeon.’ I cannot believe you.” An intimidating aura began emanating off of Lefi’s body as she spoke. “I know that I am the one that instructed you to initiate contact, but I meant not that you should sink your fangs into her. And to think that you even added a trio of wraiths to your collection while I remained none the wiser.”
“To be fair, it’s not my fault that all three wraiths are girls. They just kinda ended up that way!”***The first thing Nell saw as she exited the bath and entered the grand hall that led to it was the demon lord. He was sitting on his knees, as a silver haired girl lectured him, her tone stern.“U-Uhm… T-Thanks for letting me use your bath. It felt really nice and warm.”
“Hmm?” The girl turned away from the demon lord upon hearing the hero’s voice. “Oh hello, crybaby hero.”
“First the bullied girl, now this!? Why do you guys all seem to think of me as something to pity!?”Nell couldn’t help but yell as she was once again reminded of her cowardice by a young girl that she’d never once seen in her life. Speaking of, the blonde girl that she met in the bath had already gotten out and headed off to bed. A horned sheep demon that looked to be something along the lines of a maidservant entered the bath to pick her up right as she was starting to nod off. The maid had thanked Nell for playing with the girl before escorting the little blonde, who’d barely managed to squeeze out a tired “bye bye,” away.Behind the demon girl had been another maid, a beastkin. Though Nell failed to understand why, the Beastkin seemed to think the demon was in some sort of danger, as she had urged her to quickly return the moment she picked the young blonde up.“A-anyway, the guest’s here. S-Sorry Lefi, but I gotta entertain her.”
“Surely you jest. That is a task that Leila is more than capable of handling, and you’ve not the time for it. After all, you and I are about to spend a long night together.”The hero was having a hard time processing the scene playing out right before her eyes. The demon lord, who’d initially come off as mysterious but kind, was being scolded by a girl even younger than Nell herself.I really don’t know what I’m supposed to believe anymore…<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero and the Demon Lord
Editor: JokerNell woke up the next day as rested as could be. She hadn’t been threatened, let alone attacked, and the bed she was given was extremely comfortable. Likewise, the food was so delicious that she gobbled it down even though she’d never seen it before in her life. She felt ashamed that she’d totally lost sight of her initial objective, but she wasn’t allowed to wallow in it for long.“So who exactly sent you after me anyway?”The demon lord pulled her out of her thoughts by addressing her. He seemed really sleepy, likely because the girl she saw him with yesterday had lectured him throughout most of the night.“U-Uhm… The church did. They told me that you were an evil demon on a killing spree, and that I needed to put you down.”
“Is that all they said?”
“M-Mhm.” Nell shrunk back a bit the moment she nodded in affirmation. Oh my god! I’m such an idiot! I can’t believe I just told him that!
“Look, trusting people and stuff is fine, but you should probably know that you’re a bit too trusting…” said the demon lord, exasperated.
“U-Uhmm.. Sorry. I’ll try to be more careful.” Nell didn’t groan out of embarrassment, nor did she really fall into lament. She simply nodded along and heeded the demon lord’s words.Though she knew that the dungeon had a few more residents, the demon lord was the only one present. In fact, he and the horned sheep maid demon were the only two she’d seen all morning, and the latter had only dropped by to serve breakfast.They’re probably off somewhere in the castle.“Wait, so you’re not with the army?”
“Nope, I’m with the church. The captain of the holy knight order was the one that ordered me to come get rid of you, but she didn’t seem all that keen on the idea herself…” [1]
“I see.” The captain’s face floated across Nell’s mind as she spoke of her. Her expression was almost always calm, gallant, and refined, but was much less so when she gave Nell her orders. It seemed that the only reason she instructed the hero to sortie was because her higher ups were putting pressure on her.Wait, did I just say too much again? Nell realized too late that she’d just given the demon lord a whole slew of information about her allies. His enemies. Worried, she timidly turned her gaze towards him and asked a question. “U-Uhm… You’re not going to go attack the church now, are you…?”
“Depends. I’ll leave them alone if they leave me alone.” the demon lord shrugged. “But if they choose to oppose me, then I’ll crush them underfoot with everything I’ve got. Make sure you tell them that, loud and clear.”The demon lord’s gaze momentarily turned sharp as he issued his decree. His aura flared up, and he suddenly began to emit an incredible sense of presence. The pressure he gave off made it hard for Nell to speak, so she ended up giving him a nod.“O-okay.”
“Just saying, I’d prefer not to kill anyone, if possible. I’m not really into gore or anything else like that, but there’s no way in hell I’ll just sit around if an armed force is going to march on me, you know?”
“I guess you have a point…”Nell couldn’t deny that the demon lord’s words were logical. Nor could she deny that he was in the right. She’d spent a good portion of the previous night working her brain. She started thinking the moment she had laid down on her super comfortable bedding and didn’t stop until she had drifted off to the land of dreams.The hero spent a lot of that time thinking about everything that she’d done and everything she was going to do moving forward. She thought about the place she found herself in and the demon lord that owned it.Though she had only been in the dungeon for a single day, Nell understood that the demon lord was someone that the dungeon’s inhabitants trusted. In fact, their trust was so apparent that only a single glance was needed to discern it. From that, she derived that he couldn’t possibly be that bad a person. Those that ruled with tyranny would have far less faith placed in them. None of the dungeon’s other residents would have appeared nearly as happy as they did had the demon lord unreasonably oppressed them.To those that lived here, the hero was not her, who bore the title, but him.And she too was starting to see it. The heroes of which legends were sung always wielded their powers for others, and through their actions, earned the populace’s trust. True heroes were loved by the people. Though she herself had never witnessed his exploits, she was all but convinced that he’d done something heroic enough to earn everyone’s trust. On the other hand, all she ever did was follow orders and listen to the people around her. As far as she was concerned, he was, at the very least, much more of a hero than she.The thought was so bizarre and off putting that it led her to question both his and her roles. Just what were demon lords? And what were heroes? The answers to her questions eluded her, but she pondered them nonetheless. Even after a whole night’s worth of thinking, she wasn’t able to make any real conclusions. The only thing she managed to do was differentiate them.“You okay? You’ve been spaced out there for a good while now.”
“Oh, uhm… yeah. Sorry.” The hero got a bit flustered as she realized that she’d let her thoughts overwhelm her again. “A-Anyway, would you mind if I asked you something personal? It’s been bothering me for a while, so I really want to get it off my mind.”
“Go for it.” The demon lord brought a cup of tea to his lips as he offered to entertain her question.
“Uhm… Are you a pedophile?”
“Wha!?”The question apparently came to the demon as such a shock that he ended up doing a spit take, spraying tea everywhere as he coughed.“Ew…That’s gross.”
“Yeah, and whose fault do you think it is?” He stopped to cough a few more times. “Why the hell does everyone think I’m a lolicon!?”
“A lolicon?”
“A pedophile, a freak that gets off to little girls!” The demon lord shouted indignantly as he placed his cup back on top of the table. “Anyway, the answer to your question is a solid ‘hell no.’ I admit that there are a whole bunch of little girls hanging around here, but I swear to god I’m innocent. I didn’t go around collecting them or anything.[E1] This is just how things kinda ended up turning out on their own. I’ll even say it one more time just to be clear. I am NOT a lolicon.”
“Hmmm… Well, everyone’s different, so I’m not going to criticize you too much. The silver haired girl is at the age where it’s okay, but you really shouldn’t be laying your hands on someone as young as Illuna, you know?”
“Oh god damn it! Are you actually just not listening to me!? I could’ve sworn I literally just told you that I’m not a pedophile! Lefi’s like a…well, okay, I admit I can’t say much about her, but Illuna’s like a little sister to me! She’s totally off my radar!”
“So you have been touching that Lefi girl, then?”
“The fuck!? T-That’s not what I meant! I was just trying to say that she and I are on equal standing. I don’t need to protect her the way I protect Illuna, so I don’t think of them the same way.”Nell giggled as she listened to the demon lord attempt to form an excuse.He really is every bit as human as I am.“The hell are you giggling about now…?”
“Nothing really.” Nell smiled. “I just found it funny that we’re talking to each other like this even though I was dead set on killing you just yesterday.”
“Well, I guess this whole situation is kinda weird if you put it that way.”
“It really is just like you said. You can’t really understand things without seeing and thinking about them for yourself. I think I’m going to start doing just that. I’ll try my best to be my own person and make my own decisions.”
“Please do. I’d prefer not to keep making enemies just ’cause I’m a demon lord.”Seeing the way the demon lord casually shrugged caused yet another smile to break out on Nell’s face.***[1] It isn’t actually specified if the holy knight’s commander is male or female. I’m going to assume female for now given the lack of a female knight trope character and because the author intentionally avoided mentioning the character’s gender.[E1] ([Editor note 1): Gotta catch ‘em all! Lolicon! I’m sorry. That’s just the thought that went through my head reading that.Hey guys! Joker here. Looks like our resident demon lord is, of course, unknowingly building up his harem even more. Cheeky guy. Riajuu explode and all that nonsense. I’ll admit to being a bit underwhelmed at this arc. I really preferred the whole dungeon building stuff. Hopefully, that’s coming up soon. (Cannot read Japanese kanji and katakana to literally save his own life. >.>) Also, while I was editing this, my sister’s boyfriend brought me back some dinner. Raising Cane’s, which for anyone who doesn’t know, make just chicken fingers. It’s pretty good, but he brought back about 6-8 tenders and what felt like a pound of fries. So had to edit this a bit bloated. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take stomach medicine. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

You know what? Let’s head to town!
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixMuch to my surprise, the hero hadn’t antagonized me to the point of no return. She was friendly and open-minded enough to see past her prejudices and hold a proper conversation. Actually, that’s not quite right. It’s more like she’s just too innocent to really doubt my intentions.Though I’d always wanted to ask her about humanity as a whole, the truth of the matter was that, at first, I wasn’t actually all that keen on letting her intrude on my territory for too long. Heaps of hesitation came when I considered the idea. There seemed to be far too many risks and barely any reward, so I’d actually planned on turning her away. But Illuna had convinced me otherwise.The first thing the young girl had said to me after coming out of the bath was that I could trust the hero because she was a good person. For one reason or another, Illuna’s instincts were remarkable. She was able to tell apart things that would cause her harm and things that wouldn’t at a glance. Without a word from me, Illuna had been able to point out dangerous monsters and steer clear of them the one time she accompanied me into the forest. If even Illuna was willing to testify that the hero was harmless, then there was no reason for me to believe otherwise. In fact, I trusted her instincts so much that I more or less completely let my guard down. Thanks to our resident vampire, I decided to let the hero stay overnight before asking her about the human world the next morning.Her answers were informative. They told me that I had a fair situation on my hands.From her responses, I immediately derived that the church bore a wide sphere of influence. They were so influential, in fact, that they had their own private military unit, an order of holy knights. The mastermind behind the incident, however, was able to get the church into a situation in which it either couldn’t or didn’t want to deny his request, be it through money, political pressure, or some other facet of influence. Though the church was powerful, the wirepuller was even more so—especially seeing as how he’d even managed to mobilize an army.I kind of want to say that I’m probably up against an entire country or something similar, but that doesn’t really seem quite right. There’s something… off. The driving force behind both the army and hero incidents seemed a bit… lacking. The mastermind’s methods were needlessly convoluted. It’s almost as if the guy’s going out of his way to leap through hoops. The force that’d come knocking on my doorstep just the other day was a bit small for an army, at least compared to what it could’ve been. I mean, it’s possible that the mastermind just underestimated me because he kinda lacked intel, but there’s always a chance that he’s just retarded. I think I’m going to be leaning closer to the needless hoops theory though, since he did at least kind of learn from his mistakes.The fact that he sent the hero was a huge improvement. She was basically stronger than the entire army all on her own. In fact, there was a fair chance that she would have defeated me had she not been such a scaredy cat. My stats were higher than hers, but I’d yet to be trained in combat. I was a total shitter that didn’t have the technique or combat experience to make use of his talents. That, however, was his only improvement.Sending the hero alone is kind of a pretty big risk. Like, I know the dude’s salty and probably doesn’t want to spend any extra resources since I just blew up his army, but you’d think he’d at least give her a few companions or something. Like, he’d just be totally screwing himself up the butt if he lost the hero just ‘cause he didn’t provide her with enough support.Of course, the most optimal solution would have been to send the army and hero together. If the mastermind was acting on the country’s orders, or in a position to give them, then it didn’t make sense for him not to have his forces boldly march on the forest, regardless of purpose. And that was all the more true if he truly was working towards a cause as “noble” as retaliating to restore his or the villages’ honour. No matter the case, it simply did not make sense for the hero and army to be sent independently of one another.I mean, if he’s got the ability to get the army to abide by his will, then whoever’s out to get me should at least be a good bit higher up in government, right? You’d need some serious influence to pull off a stunt like that… Or at least I think you would. Blech, I really need to go to a place with more humans so I can learn more about this world’s people.Fortunately, I had just the right person to consult standing right in front of me. I had just escorted her out the castle, so I decided to break the silence.“Oh yeah, I’ll be having you show me around.”
“Huh?” The hero stared blankly for a few seconds before realizing that I was talking to her. “Uhm… I’m not really sure I know what you mean.”
“You know how you’re ‘bout to head back?”
“Mhm…?”
“Yeah, I’mma tag along.”
“Huh?” The hero blinked a few times while staring at me as she tried to process what I’d just said.
“I’ve been wanting to hit up a human village for quite some time, and this is as good a chance as any. So yeah, thanks in advance.”
“Huh!?” Again, the hero blinked. She was so shocked by my sudden declaration that she didn’t know what to say.“Ah, yes. That is right, Yuki. I would like to bring to your attention that I will be joining you.” The next person to speak was Lefi. She and all the dungeon’s other residents had gathered in front of the castle. I’d already told them my intentions a bit earlier on in the day, so they all came to see me off.
“Wait, you are?” It was my turn to blink. Lefi hadn’t said anything about joining me when I first informed her of my decision. This was my first time hearing about it. In fact, the only one that had expressed their wish to join me was Illuna. I wanted to entertain her request, but I couldn’t. I was confident that I could protect myself even if my identity was exposed, but I somehow doubted that I would be able to keep the both of us safe at the same time, especially since taking her along doubled the risk of exposure. Leaving her here with Leila and Lyuu was the safer choice by all means.“What? Have you a reason to refuse?” An intrepid smile surfaced on Lefi’s face as she stared me down. It’s almost like she’s daring me to say no.
“Nah, not at all. In fact, I’d be happy to have you join me. I’m just a bit surprised is all. I didn’t think you’d be interested.”Having Lefi come with me is reassuring. Her being there makes even the worst case scenario a hell of a lot easier to deal with.“Y-You are happy?” Lefi’s cheeks blushed a pale pink, but she quickly dispelled it with a cough. “I have only chosen to accompany you because I know now that your nature renders you far too soft on women. It would bother me if you took too long to return because you were infatuated with a human. My purpose is merely to keep an eye on you.”
“Yup yup! I know, right! You gotta work hard, Lefi! Do your best!” Wait, was that Illuna that just said that? Is that why she wanted to join me in the first place?
“Very well. I shall endeavor to ensure Yuki does not lose his way.”I couldn’t help but smile wryly as the two conversed. They clearly didn’t trust me.“Yeah, yeah, I get it. Anyway, take care of the house while I’m gone, alright guys?”
“As you wish, My Lord,” replied Leila.
“You betcha! We’ll keep this place nice ‘n safe while yer out, Master!”
“Iunno why but hearing you say that makes me feel super worried, Lyuu.”
“Huh!? What gives!?” The beastkin was so shocked that her jaw dropped all the way to the floor.
“I’m just kidding.” The exaggerated expression prompted me to laugh as I responded. “Come on, you know I trust you guys. I wouldn’t be relying on you guys as much as I am if I didn’t. Rir, I’m leaving you in charge of defense. Destroy any enemies that show up without exception. And you too Shii. Do your best to protect everyone while I’m out, ‘kay?”My two pets each responded with their own affirmations. Rir nodded faithfully, while Shii happily bounced around.“Alrighty then. I’ll see you guys in a week.” I bid my farewells to everyone present, including the three wraith girls waving from one of the castle’s windows.
“I too shall soon return.”
“Okay! Have a great trip guys!” said Illuna.
“Do stay safe,” said Leila.
“See ya!” said Lyuu.The hero, the only person not caught up in the “bon-voyage” themed ambiance, voiced a bit of pitiable, idle complaint that she was no longer able to hold back.“Umm… What about my say in all this…?”***Editor’s Note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another chapter down. Looks like Yuki’s gonna go visit a town. Wonder how this is gonna go down. Heh. At least Lefi’s coming with him. Any problem comes up, she can handle it fairly easily. Almost makes Yuki going superfluous, don’t you think? Ah well. It’ll be good experience for him, one way or the other. Hah. Double meanings are double. Not really a lot to talk about here. Kinda recovering from some allergies or a cold, so I’ll leave it here for now. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Second Visit to a City in Another World
Editor(s): Joker“Woo! We made it!” I cheered and raised both arms in excitement as Nell, Lefi, and I closed in on the city’s gates. “Hell yeah, it’s time for some city life! I can’t wait!”The people around us stared and giggled in response to my antics. They seemed to think that I was a crazy hillbilly from some random village in the middle of nowhere.“U-Uhm… C-Could you please be a bit quieter? You’re being really embarrassing.” Likewise, the hero didn’t think my behaviour was quite appropriate. She tried calming me down with a shy whisper of a complaint, but I shrugged it off.
“Embarrassment? Feh! A mere bit of embarrassment is nothing in the face of the fiery emotions bursting out from within my heart!”
“Yeah, but what about us…?” Dismayed and shocked, the hero groaned and drooped her shoulders.
“You’ve little choice but to give up, He-Nell.” Lefi spoke to the other girl and offered her condolences. She was about to refer to her as the hero, but stopped herself short and corrected herself before she did. “It is not possible for an outside influence to wrench him from his current state. Waiting for it to pass is the only option.”Unlike the hero, the dragon girl’s tone carried no shame. The only emotion it contained was exasperation. See, Lefi understands me. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to stay calm. I’m visiting a city in another world. Like, holy shit! That’s an event to get excited about if I’ve ever seen one. It was technically my second time visiting the city, but I’d been too angry and fired up the first time to really examine the environment and take in everything the city had to offer. The one thing I did note back then was that the city’s walls were impressive, even from all the way up in the air. Seeing them again, but on the ground, only furthered my impression of it.‘Course, it still loses out to my castle and whatnot, but I really gotta say. It’s pretty damn impressive.“Alright, enough chit-chatting. Let’s go!”
“Huh? W-Wait, hold on!” The hero took a second to react and pull herself out of her daze. She tried to stop me as soon as she did, but I didn’t listen. I simply continued marching onwards as per my declaration, only to be stopped by a spear. The guard standing at the gate lowered his weapon and refused to let me pass.“What the hell?” I groaned. “Dude, you mind moving that weapon of yours? I’ve got places to be and it’s in my way.”
“Your papers?” The man replied with a gruff, grumpy groan. He was an older man, likely in his late thirties or early forties.
“My what?” I heard him loud and clear, but I didn’t understand what he was trying to tell me.
“Show me your papers if you want to pass. I’m not letting you in unless you’ve got valid ID.”…Seriously? Is he seriously trying to ID me? Isn’t this supposed to be another world, an undeveloped fantastical land? Why the hell do they use IDs? Isn’t that something only more developed societies bother with?“What the hell, old-timer? Didn’t you just let another group walk right by you?”
“I did, but that was only because I recognized their faces. They use this gate often. You, on the other hand, I don’t recognize. You look suspicious.” The guard glared at me through the narrow slit in his helmet. “And I’m not old! I’m still in my prime!”The old man followed up his accusation with a shout, but I’d long stopped paying attention. He lost me the moment he made me realize that I wasn’t going to be allowed into town.What the hell!? Talk about game-breaking. Why the hell do I have to get hard stopped here of all times?“What a shame… To think that the path to achieving my ambitions would already be forced to a close…” I groaned and began speaking as would a character from a historical drama as I fell limp.
“Geez, that’s why I told you to wait.” The hero ran over and pulled what looked to be some sort of seal out from her bag. “I’m with the church,” she said, as she showed it to the guard. “These two are my companions. I met them on my journey. Could you please issue them some temporary ID and let them through?”
“That sigil… so you are a holy knight?” The guard’s eyes widened when he saw the crest embedded into the hero’s seal. “I understand, ma’am. I will have their IDs ready immediately.”He took off in hot haste and rushed into the station. His attitude had taken a full 180. Holy Knight? Oh, wait, duh. He means the Hero. Yeah, I guess it does make sense for her to be a part of the faction she was trained by.“The hell did you just show him He-Nell?” I raised an eyebrow as I referred to the hero in the exact same awkward way that Lefi had just a bit earlier.
“One of the church’s travel permits. As the hero, I kinda need to be able to get around, so…”
“Huh. You sure do have a lot of power for someone totally ignorant of the ways of the world.”
“I really don’t want to hear that from you, especially after what you just did!” cried the hero, indignantly. “Oh and can you guys please be more careful about the whole hero thing?”
“Yeah, yeah, we know.” I rolled my eyes.
“Indeed. Altering the manner in which we refer to you is but a simple matter,” added Lefi.The hero, or rather, Nell, had asked us to refer to her by name rather than her title. She was so vehement about it, in fact, that she refused to take us along until after we agreed to the condition. It’s kind of a pain in the ass but whatever. I’m sure she’s got her reasons, and it’s still totally worth it.The guard returned after several minutes. In his hands were a pair of wooden plates each about the size of a credit card.“Sorry to keep you waiting, ma’am.” The old man nodded to Nell before turning to Lefi and I and handing us our cards. “And as for you lot, you better not cause any trouble. I’m letting you through this time ‘cause you’re with a holy knight, but that’s the only reason. If not for her, you’d be stuck at the gates at best. Your IDs are temporary, which means we’ll be hauling you out of town if you start anything.”His tone shifted the moment he started speaking to us. He was obviously acting much less politely.“Yeah yeah, I know. Thanks, old man.”
“Middle aged as you are, we owe you our gratitude,” said Lefi.
“I’m definitely not letting you assholes in next time you stop by…” The guard’s veins started bulging out of his forehead as he grumbled.Huh. That’s weird. Why’s he so angry?Putting the gate and its guard behind me, I entered the town. The sight that greeted me left me speechless. It was fascinating. It looked like a scene ripped straight out of a JRPG; everything had a clear high fantasy feel to it. The buildings themselves were all made of similar materials and bore similar shapes, but not to the point of excess. The streets were wide, and the denizens that wandered them wore typical fantasy like clothes. There were even a couple carriages here and there.Seeing it all left me unbearably excited. I couldn’t sit still. I needed to explore.“‘Kay, first things first, let’s find ourselves some food!”***“Woah, you see that? It looks super tasty.”
“That it does, and as does this.”
“I know, right? Let’s get both.”A few minutes was all it took for Lefi and I to get into tourist mode. We wandered the streets and bought a bunch of different stuff from the food stalls around us as we did.“Urrgnnggh…” The hero let out a sound that sounded half like a cry and half like a moan. “My money’s being used up so quickly that it’s practically vanishing into thin air…”Neither the dragon nor I, the demon lord, possessed any sort of human currency. We were mooching off the hero and having her buy us everything we wanted. Though it was just street food, the stuff we were eating was genuinely delicious. Most of it was monster meat, but it was much more delicious than the stuff I made.Right. Of course it is. They’ve actually got chefs. Me, I’m just an amateur.The magical energy within the meat had been evenly dispersed throughout. Both the feel and taste were consistent. The light seasoning merged with the meat’s natural juicy flavour to create a combination that was simply irresistible.Man, this is delicious. It’s just as good as the stuff Leila makes. Actually, now that I think about it, just who is Leila anyway? And why’s she so competent?The maid in question was capable of accomplishing any task assigned to her with undeniable proficiency. She could cook as well as a chef, clean as well as a housekeeper, and handle every other task that came up regardless of what it was. I’d even caught her teaching Illuna from time to time, and the only thing I could possibly say about her explanations were that they made perfect sense despite being concise.Unable to withstand the urge, I’d asked Leila if she happened to have any relevant experience. Much to my surprise, the answer was a firm no. But either way, it didn’t really matter.She made my life easier, so I was just glad to have her on board. I didn’t care who or what she was, nor did I need to know her past. All that mattered to me was that she was so competent that she made my life a helluva lot easier.Lyuu, on the other hand… well, let’s just say she’s been… improving. Yeah, let’s go with that.I directed my thoughts away from the maids in my employ and focused on my surroundings. Though I’d attacked the city once in the past, none of its citizens had recognized me. A part of it was likely due to my attitude. I was boldly walking around town like it was nobody’s business, and because I was acting so casually, no one paid me any extra attention. Besides, last time I was here, I was blasting off magical energy and intimidating everyone I came across. There were only two humans that’d ever gotten a good look at my face: this city’s lord and that relatively strong commander affiliated with the army.Likewise, Lefi was also blending in. She’d retracted both her horns and tail, so she looked no different from any other human. The person in question, however, apparently felt rather uncomfortable. She thought it weird to be missing parts of her body that were normally there. Yeah, I can see that. I’d feel weird too if I suddenly found myself missing an arm.“Could the two of you please be a little more considerate…?” The hero was practically sobbing as she followed behind us, but we didn’t mind her and continued buying everything that caught our eye.“Woah, what’s that?” I noticed that there was a crowd gathered around something, making a commotion as it did, so I stopped binge eating and headed over in order to figure out what was going on. Is that… a magic show?At the crowd’s centre was a group of mages, or more accurately, street performers. They were casting elaborate flashy spells to entertain the people around them.Huh, that’s different. I’d learned my magic from Lefi, so I’d ended up emulating her style. All my spells centered around brute force. They were completely unlike the precise constructions that the mages hosting the local event were executing. The way they’re using their magic makes for a pretty good reference. I should probably try it myself sometime.“Mmrph. Yuki, I require your assistance.” Lefi interrupted my thoughts with an angry groan.
“What’s up?”
“I cannot see.” The dragon girl was too short to see through the shoulders of the people gathered in front of her.
“Alright, I gotchu.”I bent over, stuck my head between her legs, and stood back up with her mounted on my shoulders.“That any better?”
“It is.”
“‘Kay, that’s taken care of then.”
“Indeed it is,” Lefi agreed. The fact that her voice was coming from right above my head was a bit weird.“You two sure do get along…” The hero rolled her eyes. “We should probably get you guys registered at the Adventurers’ Guild. L-”
“There’s an Adventurers’ Guild!?” It seemed like the hero was going to continue her explanation, but I cut her off. I was too excited not to.
“Yeah, it’s an organisation that helps people find work, you know, like exterminating monsters and stuff. Registering as an adventurer is the best way to get you guys some ID, because they don’t really do background checks.”
“Interesting.” So the Adventurers’ Guild really does exist. Of course it does, I’m not sure why I’d ever expect otherwise. Tropes ahoy! And as for registering? Hell yeah, I’m down. Feels more like a typical reincarnation plot that way.“Why do you appear so excited?” Lefi raised her brows as she looked at the silly grin stuck to my face.
“How can I not? There’s an Adventurers’ Guild! A god damned Adventurers’ Guild!!”
“Adventurers? You mean the individuals that profit from the murder of monsters and non-humans? Are they not your enemies?”
“I mean, technically, yeah, you’re right. But becoming an adventurer is just something that all men gotta do.”
“I am not sure that I follow.” Lefi forced a bit of a smile. It seemed that she decided that there was no point in questioning me further.I guess it’s a bit of a weird concept to grasp if you’re not a guy. Oh well.Either way, I was planning to enjoy the overly tropey scenario for as long as it kept me entertained.***Editor’s Note: Hey guys! Joker here. Yet another chapter of JM finished. Yuki heads to the city, gawks around at the sights, and ends up planning to join the Adventurer’s Guild. Of course he does. It’s an isekai novel after all. Why wouldn’t he? Sure would suck if he builds up relationships with other adventurers, only to have them try and invade his dungeon. Though it might make for good character development for him. Hmm. Also, I wonder if his stats will be huge from the start, as most other isekai novels do, or if he’ll hide them, like a few others do. Lefi as well. If they see how strong she is, they’re liable to crap themselves on the spot, and wouldn’t that be awkward? Well, I’ll guess we’ll see next time. So until then: See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Demon Lord Becomes an Adventurer
Editor: Joker
“I must admit, I am impressed.” Lefi offered a compliment as she scanned the city. Her eyes darted all over, taking in all it had to offer. “I had always assumed human settlements to be boring. Evidently, that is not the case.”
“Wait, this is your first time visiting a human city?”The hell? Hasn’t she been alive for over a thousand years?Though we’d already finished watching the street performers do their thing, the dragon girl was still mounted atop my shoulders. She liked the view. It apparently felt to her like she was gazing down on everyone else around her from a position of power. That’s the Supreme Dragon for you, I guess. Too bad the townsfolk don’t feel the same. The people we passed clearly viewed her as something far less sinister and intimidating. In fact, she was flashed many a warm gaze as we moved down the street. It felt to me like they were looking at her as they would any other happy child. The discrepancy between the two contrasting opinions was so drastic that I almost wanted to go around asking people what they thought of her, just for shits and giggles.“I had never once visited a human settlement without razing it and reducing it to cinders in the process. This is my first time walking amongst a crowd filled with the species’s members. I had little interest in their affairs.”
“Makes sense.”Right. She did mention something about agreeing to some sort of non-interference pact. She’s probably never entered any human settlements since, let alone visited one just to sightsee. Wait, isn’t she technically violating the pact right now? Errr… guess not, actually. They invaded our territory first. The pact basically doesn’t mean shit anymore.“Ah, yes, Yuki. I forgot that there was a concern I would like addressed,” said Lefi.
“What?”
“I understand that my thighs excite you, but please do exercise restraint. Your thoughts are written all over your face.”
“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about!”I immediately began shouting in denial, but to no avail. Neither of my companions were even the slightest bit convinced.“Wow, you’re such a pervert.” The hero turned towards me and flashed me a look of disbelief.Oh gawd. Stahp it! Don’t look at me like that! Man, sure, I admit I thought they were nice and soft, but that’s it! It’s not like I was popping a stiffie!“Ahem.” I faked a cough and cleared my throat before asking the hero a question. “So I’ve been meaning to ask you this for a while now, but just what do adventurers do anyway?”
“You’re not tricking me that easily, Yuki. I know you’re just trying to change the topic.” Looking over at her, I was once again met by a pair of disapproving eyes.The hero and I were only calling each other by our names purely out of necessity. I would’ve very much preferred to use titles, but she wanted to keep her identity a secret, and she couldn’t exactly go around referring to me as a demon lord in the middle of town. She’d thought about giving me a nickname, but ultimately decided that my name was the best choice. Apparently, she felt like I gave off a “guy next door” kinda vibe.Makes sense. I was human until I reincarnated, and I was pretty much an average dude, so I can see where that’s coming from. I do kind of want to give off a more demon lord kind of feel though. I guess I’ll have to put in a bit of extra effort into seeming more dignified and shit.Likewise, the hero had also tried giving Lefi a nickname. Or rather, a new nickname. Lefi didn’t take kindly to it, however, and silenced her with a “smile.” The dragon adamantly refused to go by anything but Lefi or Leficios, and as the former was shorter and more casual, the hero opted for it.I’d also tried giving the dragon a new nickname just to mess with her. She ended up getting so mad she slugged me in the face. Oh man, that hurt like hell. Stupid dragon hits like a truck.“But sure, I guess we can disregard your ‘preferences’ for the time being.” The look on the hero’s face almost seemed a bit smug, as if she was basking in her victory. “Adventurers are responsible for killing monsters, guarding things, and collecting rare medicinal herbs. I know Lefi mentioned it a bit earlier, but they don’t actually go around killing members of the other races.”Oh, so they’re kinda like the hunters from Monster H*nter.“Are you certain? I have been attacked by many an adventurer in my time,” said Lefi.
“They probably mistook you for some sort of monster.” I shrugged. I mean you kinda are the “Supreme Dragon.” Like, girl, you probably show up in people’s nightmares. Shit.
“How rude..” The dragon frowned. “Their discourtesy deserves retribution. I shall exterminate them and leave not even a single one behind.”
“Please don’t!” said Nell.***We arrived in front of a building that could only be described as a hall after pushing our way through the city’s bustling streets. There was a constant stream of people going both in and out. A single glance was enough to see that business was thriving.“We’re finally here.” I grinned as I gave the building a once over. I couldn’t help but impatiently start stepping forward. “Alright, enough staring. Let’s go. Right now.”
“You don’t have a single timid bone in your body, do you?”
“He does not.” Lefi, who’d only just gotten off my shoulders, answered with a nod. “His idiocy has rendered him unable to feel the sentiment.”
“Yeah, ‘cause I’m the idiot for getting all emotional. Sure.” I rolled my eyes. “Unlike you morons, I’m not about to let some silly ‘sentiment’ hold me back.”I waltzed straight through the open front door as I spoke, my heart pounding with excitement. As I did, I felt a sudden wave of force worm its way into my ears; the first sense the guild appealed to was my sense of sound.It was loud. The place was busy and the noise level was through the roof. Conversations could be heard amidst the clinking of tableware, but there were so many of them going on at once that they were indiscernible. I could not, for the life of me, tell who was saying what. Yet, despite the overwhelming noise, I didn’t find myself annoyed. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Man, this place has got a helluva good feel going for it. Lefi looked like a young girl, and while Nell did look a bit older, she wasn’t by any means a full fledged adult. Naturally, the two of them drew countless stares as they entered the facility, but none lasted for more than a moment. The adventurers soon returned to eating, chatting, and getting plastered in broad daylight. The reason the guild was so crowded became immediately clear as I realized that it was adjoined with a restaurant. It was lunchtime. Many of the individuals present were just here to eat.I moved through the guild’s hall and made my way over to the counter. There, I was greeted by a receptionist that looked to be a woman in her twenties.“Welcome to the Adventurers’ Guild. How can I help you?” She spoke in a surprisingly polite tone.
“My companions would like to register with the guild,” replied the hero.
“Both of them?” The receptionist’s gaze fell on Lefi. “I’m sorry if this sounds rude, but do you mean to say that the lady would like to register as well? She seems a little young.”Yeah, I getchu lady. Lefi doesn’t look anything like an adventurer, even discounting her age. Her hair and skin are in good shape, and she doesn’t have any scars. You wouldn’t think she’s a fighter at a glance. As far as the receptionist is concerned, she probably looks more like the daughter of some rich aristocrat.“And that is a problem?” Lefi narrowed her gaze.
“Not at all,” replied the receptionist.
“I can vouch for their characters and backgrounds.” The hero cut into the conversation before it devolved and showed the guild’s clerk the same seal she’d shown the guard just a bit earlier.
“Great, that makes things much easier.” The receptionist nodded. Though she did react with a bit of surprise, she quickly recovered and got back to work. “Could you please each place a hand on one of the magical devices sitting on the edge of the counter?”The clerk directed us towards a series of crude looking machines. Though they were made of metal, they were primitive and unrefined. Lefi and I each stood in front of one and followed the receptionist’s instructions by placing our hands atop a flat plate situated on the device. I felt it suck out a slight bit of my magical energy while making a strange, mechanical whirring. The sound vaguely reminded me of a printing press.Before long, the machine ejected a copper-brown card the same size as the wooden board we’d gotten from the guard upon entering the town. There was a strange symbol comprised of three vertical lines carved into it. The symbol reminded me a lot of 川, the Japanese Kanji for river.“And that’s that. Your registration is now complete. Congratulations, you’re now members of the Adventurers’ Guild,” said the clerk, with a smile. “The card you just received doubles as your ID, so try not to lose it.”
“Huh. That was easy.”
“The process used to be much more complicated, but it disqualified far too many people. The adventuring business wasn’t looking so good back then, so we had to change it. Nowadays, all we do is scan your magical energy and register you based off that.”
“Oh. Makes sense.” I guess it’s kind of like what you do when you hire workers from a temp agency. You can’t really just make them wait outside until an actual employee stops by to let them in, so you issue them their own passes and whatnot to make their lives easier and the company more productive.The receptionist then wrapped up the conversation by explaining the basics of adventuring. And with that, the deed was done. We were adventurers, guild members ready to set off and do work.“Wake up, Lefi. The lecture’s over.” I shook Lefi, who’d totally nodded off. The sheer boredom had put her straight to sleep.
“Mmrrphh…” She rubbed her eyes as she slowly woke back up. The gesture was so cute and lovely that it forced a bit of a wry smile onto my face.After making sure she wouldn’t pass out again, I looked back at the copper coloured plate and grinned. Holy crap, am I excited. Man, Lefi and the hero probably think I’m just being childish as fuck, but like, dude, I just became an adventurer. How could any real man not be excited?“That card will let you enter the city whenever you’d like, so we should probably head back to the gate and return the temporary ID you got when you leave.”“Yeah, sounds good. Thanks Nell, I owe you one.”Alright! Here begins a heart throbbing adventure, a mysterious and bizarre tale featuring a Demon Lord seeking a life of adventure! Hell yeah! Let’s do this!***Editor’s Note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, that was a bit of a let down for me. I was expecting excitement when people found out what Lefi or Yuki actually were. But I guess if that happened, they wouldn’t be able to join, so it’s a necessary evil, I guess. But man, just think. The SUPREME DRAGON wanting to be an adventurer and having to start at the bottom. Dunno if I would want to keep adventuring if I know she’s out there. Just saying. But anyway, looks like we’re going to start seeing some adventuring from our resident demon lord. So, until then! See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Of Magic Crests
Editor: Joker“Just double checking.” I addressed the receptionist shortly after she finished telling us about the guild and our new membership. “You said that you guys buy dead monsters, right?”“We do. I can take anything you have and don’t need off your hands right away.”Admittedly, I do feel just a bit bad about having the hero blow all her cash on us, so I might as well grab myself some pocket change. I prepared to reach into my item box, but stopped myself short of activating the skill.“Hey Nell. What do you humans think of item boxes?” I leaned over and began whispering to the hero.
“Item boxes? Oh, you mean storage magic?”
“Uhhh yeah. Sure, let’s go with that.”
“It’s a bit rare, but anyone with the affinity for it can use it, so it’s not anything particularly off putting.”Sweet. No need to hold back then, I guess. I activated the skill and distorted the area near my right hand by creating what looked like a tear in space itself. I reached inside it and began to look around for something to sell. Let’s see… I probably shouldn’t sell the stuff that I need to work with Rir to take down. That stuff’s way too tasty. Cashing it in would be wasteful. I guess I’ll just dump a few of the monsters I can take out with just one punch.I pulled out several corpses and placed them atop the counter.“B-Bro, you see that? The guy just pulled out a Horned Tiger!”
“Aye. And that’s not all. Look, he’s got a god damned Bloody Bear!”
“Holy hell! There’s even a Marmodoltis!” [1]The few people who happened to be looking my way reacted with shock. The extent of their surprise drew more gazes, leading to yet a second group exclaiming their surprise. The vicious cycle repeated itself until every single adventurer in the guild had their heads craned towards me.“Fmph.” I crossed my arms. A large grin spread across my face as I looked over the shocked peanut gallery. Behold, peasants. Behold my power and understand your inferiority. Mwahahahaha!“Cease your blatant idiocy, Yuki. Finish your business so that we can leave.”
“Oh come on…” I sighed as Lefi poured a figurative bucket of icy cold water right over my head. “Couldn’t you have let me bask in the sensation for a little? Why’d you have to butt in right away? Like, come on? A little fun can’t hurt, can it?”
“Yes, yes, you and your fun.” The dragon girl rolled her eyes. “Very well, do what you must, but emphasize speed. I am bored of this place. We have dawdled here for far too long.”
“Fine…” I reluctantly turned towards the receptionist, who was frozen stiff with her eyes and jaw wide open. “So uh, you mind getting me my cash?”
“R-Right, just one second.” The receptionist unfroze and fiddled around a bit before handing me a bag of coins. “T-thank you for your patience. Here’s what we owe you.”
“Aight, thanks.”
“T-Thank you very much for your patronage! Please come again!” I saw the receptionist bow out of the corner of my eye as I turned around and exited the guild.***“Hey Nell. Catch.”
“Huh? Wha!?”I divided the cash I got from the guild in half right as we left the building. I dumped one half in storage and casually chucked the other, pouch and all, at the hero.“What’s this for?”
“You know how we made you blow all that money while we were walking around town?”
“H-huh!? This is for that!? N-No way! This is like, way, way more than what I spent!” Shock filled her voice yet again as she opened the bag and examined its contents.
“I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do with it? It’s not like I’m going to be spending it or anything. Plus, I owe you for all the stuff you’ve taught me about human society. Just think of it as me paying tuition.”
“Really? Are you sure you won’t ask for it back later?”
“Naw. Just take it.”“Thanks so much!” The hero fumbled around in panic and almost dropped the bag as she tried to figure out where to put it. That’s weird. I guess she must’ve had money trouble growing up or something.Though she was more than strong enough to take out the monsters I just sold with ease, she clearly wasn’t used to having anything more than just a bit of pocket change.“Oh right. What’s this thing anyway?” I pulled out the card I got from the Adventurers’ Guild and pointed to the pattern engraved upon it.
“That’s your magic crest.” The hero responded after finally deciding to fasten the bag of coins to her waist. “Your crest reflects your mana’s wavelength, and everyone’s is different. The crest will glow a bit if you channel your mana through it.”
“Does it?” I followed her prompt and cycled a tiny bit of my magical energy through the card. Sure enough, the wavelike crest began to give off a faint light.
“It only glows if its owner is the person channeling, so it makes for really good ID. You can’t just pretend to be someone you’re not.”
“Huh. I’m impressed. These cards have got a lot more to them than I was giving them credit for.” I said. “But wait, what about people that don’t have mana?”
“What do you mean people that don’t have mana? Everyone has mana.” The hero gave me the most incredulous look as she questioned my lack of common sense. Oh… I see. So this is one of those worlds.
“The closest thing you’ll get to someone without mana is someone that can’t really control the flow of their mana.” The hero continued. “They’re considered exceptions, and they tend to have their own specially made ID cards.”Man, I have to say, this whole ID thing is really well put together. I guess mankind’s ingenuity really isn’t something to be underestimated, huh?“So it’s like this everywhere?”
“Not really,” said the hero. “This city is one of the only places where everything is so nice and organised. It tends to be a lot more sloppy everywhere else.”Or not. There goes that idea. I hadn’t realized it when I first met him, but I now understood that the city’s governor was actually quite the capable ruler.“Oh, and does the crest mean anything?”
“There’s been some talk about how they’re supposed to take different forms based on the person’s elemental affinities, but no one really knows for sure since their patterns aren’t really that clear or consistent.”Hmm… yeah, that seems about right. I’m best at water magic, and the crest I have kinda reminds me of both 水, the kanji for water, and 川, the kanji for river. You know what? I actually kinda like the way this crest thing of mine looks. I should try carving it into the next weapon I make. [2]“What’s your crest look like, Lefi?” I turned towards the dragon girl off to my side.
“See it for yourself.” Lefi pulled her guild card out of one of the pockets in her dress and showed it to me.
“Looks like… fire…?”
“Indeed.” Lefi nodded. “Though I have refrained from demonstrating it, my greatest proficiency is in wreathing flame.”
“Yeah, I don’t really think I’ve seen you use it much, if at all.”
“I have yet to see an opportunity to demonstrate it.” Lefi smiled wryly. “Fire, by nature, has little purpose but burn and destroy. You have greater proficiency for both water and earth than you do the flame, and I thought it better to instruct you in aspects pertaining to your strengths.”That’s a little too self-demeaning if you ask me. “Iunno, Lefi. I think fire’s good for more than just reducing stuff to cinders. I think it’s awesome. It’s really flashy and cool. Plus, I mean, fire just, you know, suits you. It makes me think of passion and warmth.”
“Really?” Lefi seemed taken aback.
“Yeah. I mean, you’re you, Lefi. I’m sure your flames would be nice, warm and comfy.”Lefi’s lips curved into a satisfied smile as she took an extra large step forward and began walking right by my side.***TL Notes
[1] Marmodoltis = マーモドルティス I have no idea what this is supposed to be. I’m suspecting something in German or some other European language I don’t know.[2] This is a bit hard to explain, but if you chicken scratch hard enough, they look kinda similar.Editor’s Note: Hey, Joker! Guys here. Wait. I mean, Hey guys! Joker here. Sorry about that. Just a little disoriented. Work’s going to be a killer for this month. It is Christmas and Black Friday coming up, after all. So apologies if the editing for the chapters isn’t up to snuff. I promise I’ll do my best, but I’ll count on all of y’all to catch what I miss. 😀 Looks like Yuki is turning up the charm on Lefi. Cute couple. Married life with the Supreme Dragon might suck though, so he might want to tone it down some. Well, I’m going to go curl up in bed and read my new light novels that came in. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Alleyway
Editor: SpeedphoenixLefi, the hero, and I headed back towards the city’s gates immediately after we finished up at the guild. We weren’t planning to leave just yet, but the only person amongst us that actually knew anything about human society had suggested that we return our temporary ID cards since we no longer had a need for them, and I saw no reason to refuse her suggestion. Retracing our steps exactly seemed boring, so the three of us opted to take a more scenic route. Not that you can really call it that.The area we ended up passing through was one of the town’s less populated parts. The quality of the housing was clearly inferior, and the place was riddled with unmaintained buildings and decrepit alleyways. And upon entering one such alley, I came to an abrupt stop.“Looks like we found ourselves a bit of trouble,” I complained.“Sure looks like it,” said the hero. She was nervous. So nervous, in fact, that she lowered her waist and placed a hand by the hilt of her sword. Her behaviour was basically the exact opposite of Lefi’s. The dragon girl was completely unaffected by the circumstances. The manner in which she carried herself was as natural as could be.Several armed men emerged from the shadows to block both our ways out the alley. There were three in front of us and three behind us, making for a total of six. Each wore a vulgar smile on his face. Five members of the group pointed their weapons at us while the last cockily crossed his arms. Welp, I guess they’re not here to ask us to join them for tea.Truth be told, a fair portion of my composure had stemmed from the fact that I’d long known about them. They’d been tailing us since we left the guild, and the dungeon’s map feature had allowed me to trace their movements every step of the way. The only reason that I hadn’t bothered getting the jump on them was because I wasn’t too sure how I was supposed to deal with them. I’m kind of playing the part of a law abiding citizen here, so it’s not like I can just bury ‘em.“Hey, uh… We’re kinda trying to get somewhere right now. You mind moving?” I spoke in a nonchalant tone. “Oh and by the way, I should probably mention that pointing sharp objects at people isn’t really something you’re supposed to do. I swear that’s one of the first things they teach you in school.”
“Heh. Sorry kid, but we ain’t the types of guys that went to no fancy ass school. Ain’t no one got no teachers where we came from.” The only man that had yet to draw his weapon, the group’s supposed leader, stepped forward as he grinned. His only notable trait was a massive frame. Holy crap. Talk about gains. That dude’s body looks way too stacked for its own good.“Now listen here, kid.” The leader cracked his neck. “Drop your shit and hand over all ya cash unless you want us to fuck you up real bad. And don’t try to fake jack. We know how much dough you got. We was watchin’.”
“Remind me,” I said. “Why are you trying to mess with the guy that can take out monsters strong enough to leave the whole guild in awe?”
“Nice try, but we seen that bluff of yours from a mile a way. Ain’t no way a skinny ass bitch boy like you can take out monsters that strong. You probably just yanked ‘em from someone while they wasn’t lookin.”Uh… Strong? I don’t think so, but sure bro, whatever you say. There wasn’t any reason not to, so I decided to analyze the leader and check his stats.***

Mindless Warrior***Wow. The axeman was surprisingly strong, especially for a human. That said, he still doesn’t really amount to much.The scenario I was currently in was one that would’ve caused the old me to panic, but my abilities had allowed me to discern that I was far more powerful than him. I was confident in my victory. So this is how it feels to look down on someone. Man, emperors and stuff sure had it good, huh?Though reveling in a rather pleasant sensation, I wasn’t exactly happy. If anything, I felt annoyed. I highly suspected that engaging in the altercation that was about to occur would get me kicked out of town. And as I was still in the middle of touring the city, I wasn’t exactly all that keen on the idea. I could just kill them all and shove their corpses in my inventory…I contemplated the idea, but ended up shelving it. I couldn’t let myself get spotted, so flashy magic was out of the question. And killing them one by one just sounds like a royal pain in the ass. Blech.The leader seemed to interpret my silence as confirmation that his suspicions were on point, as he broke into a hearty laugh. My god. Why the hell is he so needlessly buff anyway? His stats are way lower than both mine and Nell’s. None of that excess muscle does anything but make him look even uglier. What the hell’s even the point?“I know that brat with tits is a human, but that silver haired bitch’s got demon blood in ‘er, right?”
“What makes you think that?” I said in a curious tone.
“Heh. I guess I’ll be a nice enough guy to give you some good old edjucatin’,” said the axeman. “There’s this magical device out there that lets you tell whether or not a ‘human’ is really human, y’see. And I gotta say, sorry man, but I used it on her without tellin’ ya. Part of the job. No hard feelings.”The leader of the group flashed yet another disgusting grin. Huh. Stuff like that actually exists? You learn something new everyday, I guess.“So? Let’s just say she really is a demon. What then?”
“Heh. Glad you asked. You see kid, demons don’t get along with us humans. We can do whatever the hell we want to the damned things. There ain’t no rules holdin’ us back. But if they so much as touch us, then we can tell the guards and have them run right the hell over. They’ll have you dickwads surrounded in moments,” said the obscenely large man. “Now if you don’t want us tattlin’ and tellin’ them that she hurt us, you better hand over all every last bit of cash you got. Oh, and throw in the demon brat while you’re at it too. She’s a bit flat, but her face ain’t half bad. Don’t you worry, we’ll make her feel real good. Assuming she’s still alive by the time we start, that is! Who knows, we might be just havin’ our way with her corpse instead. Gahaha!”I saw red.An uncontrollable rage overwhelmed me the moment the man began to laugh, so I closed the distance between us with a single step, grabbed him by the neck, and lifted him into the air.“Care to repeat yourself, asshole?”
“Wha!?” The man tried to speak, but I didn’t let him. I squeezed down on his throat and reduced his words to hoarse gasps. “Arghhh! Krghghhh!”
“Tell me. What, again, were you going to do to my woman?”
“Leggo the boss you sunnuva bitch!”The man to my left brandished his sword and readied himself to slash me with it, but he was too slow. I raised the retard I was holding and whipped him at my attacker before he could complete his swing. There was a bit off a dull impact as the two bodies made contact. The force of the throw caused both brigands to fly through the air and crash into a nearby building.“You sunnofa!”
“Is that the only insult you fucktards know? How about you go learn a few new words? Might as well shove the whole dictionary up your ass while you’re at it.”I dodged a third man’s blade by nimbly twisting my body to avoid it. Using the momentum, I then delivered a powerful roundhouse kick to the side of his forehead. His body spun out the moment I made contact. He too flew through the air before violently smashing his head into the ground. And that was the last response I got from him. He lay motionless, incapable of any further movement.“I’m sorry, but I can’t pardon or defend you,” said the hero. The three men behind us had attempted to attack shortly after I lifted their boss into the air, but they were no match for the hero’s speed. She’d struck two with her still sheathed sword, and incapacitated the third in the same manner with a fluid motion as she spoke. Wow, she’s actually pretty good at this whole swordplay thing.Only a moment had passed, but Lefi, the hero, and I were the only three that remained standing.“Fuck!” That said, the state didn’t last for long. My throw hadn’t been enough to knock the leader out, so he slowly got up while shaking off the impact and drawing the axe he had mounted on his back. The weapon looked rather sinister. It was engraved with all sorts of skeletal imagery and held the same shape as the type of axe an executioner would use.I felt a surge of magical energy as the the weapon entered its hands. Surely enough, checking with my Magic Eye confirmed that the source was none other than the axe.“Fuck you! You’ll regret making me use this, bitch boy!”***

Axe of Resentment: An axe that became possessed by hatred and grief after basking in the blood and resentment of the many that had fallen to it. This weapon drives the user insane in exchange for a drastic stat boost. Quality: A+***As stated in the weapon’s description, Muscleman’s stats had undergone a pretty big change. His newfound insanity was pretty self evident. It was clear from the fact that his eyes had turned a shade of red.“Oh no! He’s got an enchanted weapon!” The hero’s voice was filled with panic.
“A what?”
“An enchanted weapon! It’s a weapon with a magical effect, kinda like my holy sword.” A bead of sweat flowed down the hero’s cheek as she spoke. “But his axe has more negative energy than I’ve ever felt in my life! I’ve never seen anything like it!”
“Heh. Heh. Heh. You shoulda listened. But it’s too late now! I’m going to butcher the fuck outta you!”Muscleman swayed from left to right in much the same manner as a piece of tarmac under the scorching summer sun as he brandished his weapon. The deranged smile he flashed made it obvious that he was no longer in control.“W-What do we do!?”
“Calm yourself, hero. You’ve not the need to panic. Anxiety and agitation will benefit you not,” said Lefi. “Would you like a cup of tea? I am certain that it would calm you.”
“Iunno about her, but I’d like one,” I said. Looks like we are having a tea party after all.
“You guys are way too relaxed! What the heck!?”The hero was astonished by our behaviour, but I didn’t really mind her. The only response I bothered giving was a casual shrug. I was way more focused on digging through inventory; I’d just opened my item box and stuck my hand inside the dimensional crack it created.From it, I procured one of the weapons I’d just recently crafted. The unreasonably muscular axe user had become the perfect target on which I could test my newest creation.<– Prev — Next –>

The Alleyway — Part II
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerI opened my inventory and reached into the spacial crack it produced. From it, I pulled out a large weapon that could only be described as a two handed greatsword. Its blade was sharp, so sharp, in fact, that it looked like it would be able to cut its way through even the hardest boulder with ease. The metal it was constructed from was dyed a shade of black as dark as the night itself. I could almost feel it sucking the light from its surroundings. Its most notable factor, however, was neither its sharpness nor its colour. But rather, its weight.The greatsword was so ridiculously heavy that even I had trouble lifting it. I had to put every last ounce of strength I had into my hips and arms just to swing the damned thing. Despite being so broad that it was abnormal, the sword carried with it an air of magnificence. The combination of its majesty and size made it seem reminiscent of my castle. At least as far as design principles go, anyway.Its status sheet looked as follows.***Name: Hasai
Description: A jet black greatsword crafted by a demon lord by the name of Yuki. It is abnormally heavy and cannot be lifted, let alone swung, by any ordinary entity.
Quality Rating: A+***As the Japanese characters in its name suggested, Hasai was developed with two concepts in mind: obstruction and destruction. The weapon was hard, heavy, and sharp as could be, but that said, it didn’t have any magical abilities. I hadn’t chosen to give it any. Er, actually, I guess it’s more like I couldn’t. I had imbued the blade with a near excessive amount of mana during its creation in order to grant it its three properties. And as a result, I had been too focused on channeling my energies through it to carve a magical circuit into its blade. I’d already done everything I could to make it as powerful as I could.I simply couldn’t have done better.Blech. I’m a bit disappointed that I wasn’t able to enchant it, but I’d say it still makes for a pretty damned good sword. It’s definitely the sharpest thing I’ve made to date, at least.“Come at me bro.” A fearless grin appeared on my face as I casually raised the weapon and took a stance. “Enchanted weapon? Buff ass bod? Bitch please. I’ll show you just how useless that fat ass of yours really is.”“Watch yer mouf dickwat!” Muscleman spluttered out a series of distorted words before kicking off the ground and shooting towards me like a bullet. An insane, bestial howl roared from his throat as his needlessly large, magically enhanced body approached. The axe in his hands traced an arc through the sky as it moved to cleave my head in two.It was a straightforward, downwards smash.I countered his blow with an equally straightforward attack of my own. I planted both my feet on the dirt floor beneath me, twisted my hips, and swung the greatsword straight at the sinister looking weapon, intercepting it before it reached its mark. A wave of force coursed through my arms and a loud ringing filled my ears. The collision created a blast of wind so intense that it pushed against every part of my body before rushing out the alleyway, disheveling my hair in the process.It was head-on clash. A contest of brute force. Sword against axe.And I came out on top.“What!?” Muscleman’s eyes opened wide in shock. He had prided his strength, and the cursed weapon he’d drawn had only bolstered it further. That, combined with the fact that he led with a full bodied downwards strike, had led him to believe that his victory was certain. But alas, his weapon had been knocked aside.The cause of his loss had been none other than the fact that he was relying on force over technique. As someone that lacked technique myself, I would’ve had a much more difficult time dealing with a fighter more capable of manipulating his weapon.“Oh come on?” I spoke in a mocking tone. “Is that all you’ve got? What the hell, man? We’ve barely even gotten started.”
“Fuck you!”Douchemuscle’s voice was filled with with vexation, so I grinned as I used the centrifugal force from the first swing to empower a second with even more weight.He barely managed to react. The obscenely large axefighter pulled his weapon into position just in time to block the strike, but because he was so rushed, he wasn’t able to correct his posture. His defenses faltered; my blade broke past his and cut into the side of his arm. Fresh blood sprayed through the air and splattered against the side of the alleyway.“Argggh! God fucking damn it!!”I immediately followed my second attack with a third, my third with a fourth. My blow had become a flurry, and my flurry a barrage. Each strike was so heavy and powerful that it was sure to tear him to pieces the moment his defenses fell short. Unlike him, his weapon stayed in good shape. It failed to bend or break despite the many times it clashed against my own.It took Muscleman a whole slew of injuries to finally realize that he was at a disadvantage. He gave up on engaging me in close quarters combat once he did, and instead grabbed something off his waist and chucked it at me. “Take this, twat!”My body moved before I could even process what the thing was and chopped it right in half. White smoke burst from the projectile and flooded my surroundings, robbing me of my vision.He had performed one of the oldest tricks in the book, a trick that continued to exist only because it was as effective as it was well known. He had created a smokescreen. Huh. It looks like he’s gone totally mad, but he’s actually still capable of making rational decisions.Buffbro backed off and effectively vanished into the fog the moment his smokescreen took effect. It was a clear attempt to gain control of the situation, and one that would have worked if I was just the average Joe.“Sucks to be you.” I turned to face the man and easily deflected his weapon the moment it permeated through the mist. A task I found all too easy. While I wasn’t able to see him, I was able to perceive him. My Magic Eye skill allowed me to detect the magical energy around both him and his axe, so I could easily tell where it was headed.“What the fu—!?” Muscleman screamed in confusion as his axe, which he’d swung with all his might, was knocked aside. But before he could finish, I skewered him.I could feel the blade in my hands rend flesh and crush bone as I thrust it into the man’s defenseless torso. Both Hasai’s blade and several litres of blood erupted from the man’s back in tandem as his body was rendered dysfunctional by the force of the blow.“Why…” Crimson fluid leaked from Muscleman’s mouth as he spoke between violent hacks. “Why did… I lose…?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” I shrugged. “You lost because you were too weak to win.”The moment I removed my blade from his gut was the moment he lost the ability to stand. The foreign object that had intruded upon his side was both the last thing keeping him supported and the last thing preventing the little blood he had left from draining away. It was a two stage action. He first fell to his knees in an attempt to resist his demise before lifelessly collapsing onto his face. The life that had filled his eyes was no more; the needlessly large man had been reduced to nothing but a needlessly large corpse.His grip on his axe loosened. It slipped out of his hands and made a metallic clang as it fell onto the dirt that lay beneath him. I flicked the blood and guts off Hasai and put it back into my inventory as I wordlessly directed my gaze at the axe that had rolled over to my feet. Man, you really don’t need any fancy skills or abilities to tell this thing is sinister as all hell. The malevolent energy it’s enchanted with is so dense that it’s actually visible. But………“Hey Lefi.”
“Yes? What is it?” The dragon girl promptly responded to my query.
“Make sure you stop me if I start acting weird. Even if you have to cut my arm off.”
“Very well.” Lefi gave me an understanding nod as she took up a stance. “I shall see that it is done.”How reliable she is. I smiled.“What are you…” The hero’s eyes went wide as she finally caught onto my plan. “Wait! Are you planning to touch it!? You really shouldn’t! That thing is really dangerous!”She tried to give me a bit of advice, but I ignored her and stretched an arm out towards the unholy weapon and touched it.Malice flowed into me the moment my fingers came into contact with it. What the hell!? It almost feels like this damned thing is prying my skull open!Copious amounts of rage, resentment, and lament poured into my mind. Hatred dyed all my thoughts with a veil of red. I felt the urge to destroy anything and everything I could get my hands on, the urge to absorb the grudges of those I slayed and use them as fuel to grow even further.They were urging me to become a part of their downwards spiral, their perpetual cycle of death, hatred, and destruction.Shut. Up. I shrouded the grudge-filled wails that assaulted my mind with a metric ton of mana and forced it into submission. Boo hoo. You died and now you hate people. Fuck off. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter who you were or what you were subject to. You’re mine now. All of you. You’re just another one of my belongings, so act like one. Shut the fuck up and let me use you. Do that, and I’ll rebirth you and release you all from your shitstained grievances.Suppressing the weapon’s will with my magical energy allowed me to tame it in a manner reminiscent of training a beast. Its wailing began to die down, eventually calming to the point where its malevolence became a non-factor.“Phew.” I breathed a sigh of relief and casually chucked the weapon into my item box. Oh man. I am so going to use Weapon Transmutation on it the moment I get home. I’ll rip out that dumb grudge stuff and turn it into something badass.Though it didn’t seem like it, the axe was the perfect target for Weapon Transmutation. It, like anything else I could channel my mana through, could be used as a raw material so long as it hadn’t gone through the process in the past.“Welp, that’s over. Man, this whole alley thing sure was a pain in the ass, huh?”
“Are you okay?” Nell asked, her eyes opened wide. “Are you sure that you’re okay? Did it really not affect you?”
“Naw, I’m fine. I’m a demon lord. Dealing with negative effects and curses and stuff may as well be a speciality of mine.”
“Uh… I’m pretty sure that’s more our domain,” said Nell.Ohhh right. Yeah, figures the church would be good at purifying curses and stuff. Holy shit, I almost forgot she was affiliated with the church. Not my fault. She’s not very holy, after all.“He is fine. The curse has not consumed him, so it is unlikely that he has been affected,” said Lefi. “That matter, however, is unimportant. I would prefer to ascertain the intent behind the words you spoke, Yuki.”
“What words?”
“I am referring to none other than the instance in which you claimed that I was your woman. Quite the bold statement, I dare say.”
“I said what!?”
“I see that you did not pay your own utterings any attention. Very well, allow me to repeat it for you.” Lefi smiled. “You said, ‘Tell me. What, again, were you planning to do to my woman?’ in that precise manner and tone. It was quite the interesting sight to behold. I’ve not seen you in such a state of rage since the first time we descended upon this settlement.”Hearing Lefi imitate me forced my brain to grind to a halt. Wait. Wait wait wait wait. I said that? Hoooooooooly shit.“D-did I really say that?” I turned to the hero, eyes wide and jaws slackened.
“You did,” said Nell in an exasperated tone. “It was pretty obvious you really meant it too.”Seriously…? Holy shit. I was so caught up in the heat of the moment that I didn’t even…“U-Uhm… yeah, my bad. I must’ve meant like, my travelling companion or something. It probably just came out wrong. Sorry if it bothers yomrphrh,” I began ranting and firing off one flustered excuse after another until Lefi finally silenced me midway by placing her hands on my cheeks and pushing them against each other.Her palms were nice and cool to the touch. Looking at her, I realized that she wasn’t angry. If anything, it was the opposite. Her eyes, which were gazing straight at my own, contained an emotion I could only describe as affection.“Do not apologize, Yuki.” The dragon girl smiled shyly as she spoke. “It was a statement that I was glad to hear.”I was instantly stupefied. I found myself staring at the charming, light blush on her face with no room to think, let alone breathe.“Uhm… Can we go now…?” said the hero.
“R-Right, my bad.” I backed away from Lefi in a hurry and shook myself as I responded to the hero. “We should probably move. We’ve wasted far too much time already.”
“Indeed. I feel the same,” said Lefi, who had already reverted to a mask of nonchalance. “I, for one, would very much like another skewer.”Yeah, sounds good. I opened my mouth to reply to the dragon girl, but stopped as several armoured men suddenly positioned themselves at the alleyway entrance.“We are Alfyro’s guards. We will consider you hostile and subject you to an assault unless you remain still!”Ohhh shiiiet. Yup. Definitely wasted too much time.I twisted my face into a frown as I looked at the armed soldiers that had greeted us, only to stop as I recognized the man standing at the group’s front. I wasn’t sure exactly where I knew him from, but I didn’t recognize him right off the bat.“Huh?” I narrowed my gaze as I gave him a second look. “Oh! Aren’t you that one old dude from that forest thing?”
“What!? And you are—”
“Hold that thought,” I said, cutting him off. “It’s probably better for you not to say what you were thinking, for both our sakes.”The guard at the squad’s helm was the old dude that had fled from my territory, the only commander whose regiment escaped my one sided slaughter, and the only member of the army that I had bothered meeting with.“…Why are you here?” the guard asked. He was trying to sound as composed as he could, but his voice remained tinged with nervousness nonetheless.
“Oh, you know. I had a little bit of business to attend to. I was thinking of meeting the governor and chatting him up a bit.”
“Wait, that’s why you wanted to visit Alfyro, Yuki?” asked Nell.
“Yeah. Him and I are acquaintances, you see.”
“Okay, I understand, but who are they?” The guard directed his gaze towards the men collapsed in the alleyway.
“Beats me. All I know is that they pretty much decided to attack us for no real reason, so I retaliated.”
“Captain,” a second guard approached the one I recognized and whispered into his ear.
“These men are known to be vile. They have many a previous offense. The claim is likely valid, sir.”The captain nodded to acknowledge the other man’s testimony before giving his squad an order, “Men, I will leave you responsible for cleaning up this mess in whatever manner you see fit.”He then turned to me and once again began to speak in a little bit more nervous a tone as he sheathed his weapon. “It seems that you’ve had to deal with a few rude guests. I would normally like to take you over to one of our stations and ask you for more details, but it seems that you’re headed for the governor’s manor, so I will be taking you there instead, if you don’t mind.”Oh wow. He’s actually offering to guide us even though he’s still clearly on guard? Er, actually I guess he’s doing it because he’s on guard. Probably wants to keep an eye on me or something. There wasn’t any reason for me to refuse, so I glanced over at my companions to check how they felt about it. Neither seemed particularly against the notion, so I responded to the man’s offer with a nod.“I would very much have preferred a chance to continue consuming skewers…” muttered Lefi. Okay. I take that back. Apparently we do have someone against the notion.Unfortunately for the dragon girl, it was a bit too late to be rescinding my decision. I’ll buy you some later, but you’ll have to just sit tight and bear with it for now.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, that went about as well as could be expected for Buffbro. May he not be missed. Plants will have quite a bit of food to eat, though, so that’s good. And it looks like Lefi didn’t miss what Yuki said, because of course she didn’t. She’s the Supreme MFing Dragon, after all. She probably could’ve atomized that group with a glance before continuing on to get some more skewers to munch on. Man, can you imagine if she found out about festival food? Deep fried twinkies, deep fried oreos.. I swear I saw deep fried cotton candy once. Don’t ask me how that’s possible, I ain’t got a clue. And if you’ve noticed, I’ve got some of my mojo back. Yay. The worst time for my job has come and gone, and I’ve survived, so get ready for more beefy editor’s notes. I know you all missed me. 😉 See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Second Visit to the Governor’s Manor
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Ayyyy, old governor dude, long time no see.”
“So you have returned…” replied the middle aged man. “I suppose that this truly was inevitable after all.”Lefi and I found ourselves located in a familiar-looking reception room. It was the very same one we had visited at the end of the whole Illuna case. The only major difference was that, this time, we had the hero in tow.Of course, there were a few minor differences as well. For example, the governor, who was sitting across from us, seemed quite a bit older than he did last time we visited. His hair was lacking its former volume, and he had gained a good number of wrinkles. He sure seems stressed. Must be all the social pressure. No worries fam, I getchu, I know what you’re going through, so I’ll make sure I don’t call you out on it. Wait, what even was the dude’s name again? Raylow, I think…? Let’s see… Yup. Raylow it is. Thank god for Analyze.“I knew that you would come seeking vengeance.”
“Uh… What?”
“I did as much as I could to dissuade them from raiding the Wicked Forest, but, as I’m sure you know, I failed. The fault is mine and mine alone. I understand that you must be angry. You are free to take my life if it will appease your rage. I am more than willing to offer myself as a sacrifice if it’s enough to repent for my mishaps. But please, please, spare the townsfolk.”The old man closed his eyes, clasped his hands together, and began speaking in a solemn but steady tone.“H-Holy shit, calm down bro.” I stuttered. “You’re getting way ahead of yourself there. I don’t have the slightest intention of seeking any sort of retribution whatsoever. I’m just here because I wanted to talk.”The old man clearly seemed to think that I took joy in mass murder. Where the hell did he get that idea? Holy crap. That’s a totally unjustified claim if I’ve ever seen one.“So you haven’t come to take your revenge?”
“Nah.”Hearing my response caused the middle aged man to heave a heavy sigh, one laced with obvious relief.“I’m glad to hear it,” he said. “And I apologize for losing my composure and jumping to conclusions.”
“For the record, I don’t actually like killing people. Look, me and you, we aren’t too different. I, no, we just want to spend our days in peace. But someone apparently doesn’t like that, and wants to stick their nose in our business. so I’m here to figure out who. I know that it’s someone that’s got ties with the government. And close ones, at that.”
“…And what, precisely, led you to that conclusion?” The middle-aged governor narrowed his eyes and took a few moments to carefully pick words that neither confirmed nor denied my claim.“It’s obvious,” I said. “I was attacked twice. The first time, it was by an army. And the second, it was by a hero. In other words, the wirepuller behind all this is powerful enough to not only move the nation’s forces, but also put pressure on the church and force them to deploy their most powerful fighter. The church is influential as all hell, so that can only mean that whatever pressured it was an even greater power. And the only one I can think of is the government.”
“The hero?” asked Raylow, in a surprised tone. Huh. Well then.
“What, you didn’t know? Well I mean, she’s literally right here, so… yeah. Why don’t you go ahead and introduce yourself, Nell?”
“…Did you really have to use me like that? I really would’ve preferred that you didn’t.” The hero flashed me a reproachful glare before turning to face the city’s head honcho. “Hello. I’m sorry for not saying anything before, but I’m a member of the Order of the Faldien Holy Knights as well as the one dubbed this generation’s hero.”
“What!?” The governor’s eyes widened in shock. “I’m sorry, please do excuse me.”The middle aged man narrowed his gaze and momentarily centered it on the hero, a focused look on his face all the while. The old man was obviously using Analyze to look over the girl’s stat card. It was an action he had refrained from doing for courtesy’s sake. Activating the skill and sneaking a peek at someone else’s personal information was effectively no different from denying the very concept of privacy.“So it really is true…” he said upon reaching a conclusion. “But pray tell, hero, why are you accompanying a demon lord, of all things?”
“Well, you see…” The hero’s shoulders dropped as she began to tell her story. “The gist of it is that I was sent to subjugate him, but I was defeated. Instead of killing me, he kinda just talked to me instead. What he told me wasn’t really consistent with the information I was dispatched with, so I decided to come here, to Alfyro, in order to find out the truth for myself. But then he kinda said he wanted to tag along, so here we are…”
“My condolences,” said the middle aged governor. His tone was heavy and thick with sympathy. “It must’ve been quite the stressful journey.”
“Yeah…” whispered the hero, her eyes distant. “It really was…”What the hell, guys? You’re almost making it sound like I’m the cause of all your undue stress.“But I must say,” muttered Raylow. “Mobilizing the hero for such a trifling ordeal is unacceptable. Do they not understand that that it is imperative we keep you safe and only have you deploy in times of national crisis? Those bumbling idiots! Just what is wrong with them!?”He started out rather quiet but worked his way up to an angry shout as he spoke. He even ended up smacking the table for extra effect. Well, someone here is clearly lacking in the emotional stability department. Must be due to all his pent up stress.“Calm down, old man,” I said. “We aren’t going to get anywhere if you keep getting your panties in a knot.”
“…Sorry.” He finally calmed down after heaving yet another heavy sigh. God damn it. Wait, why am I the one keeping him cool anyway?
“So who exactly was responsible for all this army and hero shit again?”
“That… I can’t say,” replied the governor.
“You can’t say? And what, exactly, is that supposed to mean?” I gave him an icy cold glare as I unleashed a torrent of magical energy and overwhelmed him with its pressure.Lefi hadn’t really bothered reacting to the sudden surge in mana, but the hero had leapt off the couch, gained a good bit of ground, and taken up a stance. The governor made note of her actions by glancing her way momentarily, but he soon turned his eyes back towards me and gave me a straight answer, despite the cold sweat flowing down his brow.“My loyalties lie with this country, demon lord. It is my motherland. I cannot give you any information that is likely to bring it harm, regardless of how much it angers you.”
“Even if it means I’ll destroy this city in its entirety?”
“Even so, my answer remains unchanged.” The middle aged man’s response was decisive. He had started off this conversation by stating that he valued his citizens’ lives more than his own. And now, he was stating that he would readily sacrifice them for his country’s sake. The extent of his resolution was clear, even with his own death as imminent as could be.There was a brief moment of silence as we stared each other down.“Fine, you win.” I exhaled lightly, shrugged, and stopped coercing the poor old man with my magic. “Thanks for having us. Let’s go, Lefi. There isn’t much of a point in staying here any longer.”
“Are you certain?” the dragon girl asked.
“Yeah. Why don’t we go grab you a few skewers too? I’m pretty sure you were wanting them earlier.”
“A splendid suggestion, that is. I was indeed craving their taste.”
“Are you really… not going to attack us?” asked the governor. He was completely dumbfounded by my sudden, drastic shift in attitude.
“Yeah, pretty much. I mean, what’s the point? It’s pretty obvious that you’re not planning to tell us anything, regardless of what I say or do. It’s my loss, old dude. There really isn’t anything left for me to do here but sightsee. So I might as well just finish that up and head home.”A part of it was that I was impressed. He failed to bend or break under pressure and stayed true to his beliefs. His attitude was something that I, as a man, couldn’t help but respect. There was no way I could possibly bring myself to harm anyone that manly.“What’re your plans now, Nell?” I said, turning to the hero.
“Uhm… Me? Uhm…” She relaxed her pose and brought the hand by her blade to her chin.
“I think I’m going to stick around here for a bit. I have a few things I’d like to talk to the governor about.”
“Fair enough. I do still want you to keep showing us around though, so you mind meeting somewhere around here tomorrowish?”
“Oh, uhm… sure. Okay.”***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, I dunno if that old guy is tough or just bipolar. First he says he wants to protect the townsfolk, then says to Yuki, “I don’t care how angry you are, I won’t talk.” Got some balls, old man, I’ll say that. Uh, don’t quote that out of context, please. Thank you. But anyway, why the heck did he say that? To protect the country? But the country is the one mismanaging assets, like the hero. Shouldn’t your priority be solving that problem? I dunno, maybe it’s because of the kind of world we live in. Who knows. Well, guess it’s back to sightseeing for Yuki and Lefi, as well as eating all the street vendors’ stock up. Should have bets on the side, too. Like arm wrestling contests and food contests. Easy money that way. But I guess that would break the cardinal rule of Isekai novels. “Don’t draw attention to yourself or show people how OP you are.” Hopefully, Yuki bucks that trend. He seems to be doing good so far. All right, enough rambling. See y’all in the next chapter!Translator’s Note: A lot of you guys are commenting on Yuki’s manner of speech. This is intentional. In the raw, he speaks to Raylow in a manner that can only be described as rude. He keeps calling him おっさん (ossan), which is basically an offensive way to call someone a middle aged man. He does this despite knowing his name, which is extremely rude especially that he basically walks himself into the poor man’s home uninvited. He’s being an asshole by ignoring traditional Japanese mannerisms. This, of course, doesn’t mean he’s doing anything outside the ordinary. That’s just who he is. Yuki really doesn’t care about the other person’s perception of him. Moreover, this manner of speech is most typically seen in unruly teenagers, especially those in gangs… So yes, “ayyy” and “fam,” are entirely intentional. He’s supposed to sound like that. And no, it’s not odd for him to say that stuff. He’s an internet degenerate. There are a couple comments with way more detail if you feel like finding them.<– Prev — Next –>

A Discussion Between A Hero and a Governor
Editor: Joker“What a surprise,” said Raylow. “He really did just leave.”
“Yup,” I replied. “He’s a bit of a weirdo, but he’s not a bad person.”The wry smile I had on my face was more than enough to express the emotions I felt as I watched the demon lord march himself right out the door, just as promised. I had moved to draw my weapon the moment I felt bloodlust radiate off his body, but luckily, I didn’t have to use it.Because I didn’t want to fight him.Seeing his incredible strength, just a little bit earlier, had made shivers run up my spine. He was like a furious gale. He fended off attacks from a person enhanced by a magical weapon like they were nothing. He even beat them back with just brute force. I’ve been winning most of my spars against the other holy knights lately, but I really can’t imagine ever beating him. Yuki’s just too strong. I think I might be able to get a few hits in, but he’s sure to overpower me in the end.And his display of power wasn’t the only reason I didn’t want to fight. Yuki, Lefi, and I, really did get along. Though I had a bunch of complaints about their behaviour, I couldn’t actually bring myself to hate them. Not at all. They tease me a lot more than I’d like, but I don’t really mind. Spending time together with them is fun. I had already caught myself unconsciously smiling in response to their actions on more than just a few occasions.“He’s not malicious,” I said. “To me, it seems like he’s fighting for the things he wants to protect.”
“Yes… That, I can understand.” Governor Raylow clasped his hands together and gave a deep nod, after which he heaved a sigh. The aged gentleman then scanned the room and confirmed that we were the only two inside before continuing. “Now that they are gone, hero, I believe it would be best for me tell you something you must know.”
“What is it, Mr. Governor?”
“It concerns the answer to the demon lord’s query. The individual responsible for the deployment of both you and the army that came before you is none other than His Highness, Prince Riutt.”
“His highness…?” I put a finger on my chin as I recalled the man. I had once met him while accompanied by one of the church’s priests. He was a young man who seemed rather diligent. I could tell that he had good intentions, but I also felt as if he had been a bit strong willed.“The Wicked Forest has been demarcated as an uncharted territory for generations. His Highness has likely forecasted that it contains abundant resources to match its time outside of human hands, and that our country will spin many a profit if he succeeds in seizing control of it. Hearing his plan, the other nobles began to add their resource pools to his own. It was precisely through this that he amassed an army.”
“Does that mean His Majesty the King is aware of His Highness’ intentions?”
“While His Majesty is a wonderful person and a soul kind beyond words, he is not extremely proficient in his role as monarch. I highly doubt that he is aware of His Highness’ choices.” Raylow sadly shook his head from side to side. “I paid the royal palace many a visit, but I was denied the opportunity to report my findings to him on every occasion. Giving up, I attempted to warn the individuals responsible for deploying the troops, but they mocked me for my fear of the enemy and failed to seriously consider the information I had for them. ”
“They completely ignored you?”
“It is as you say…” Raylow ground his teeth against each other and balled his hands up into fists as he spoke. “None of them realize that their actions are putting the whole country in jeopardy! Damn it! How could they be so irresponsible!?”
“I’m sorry,” I said, with a frown. “I’ll try visiting the church and asking the priest for his advice. I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to accomplish anything, but I’ll at least try.”
“Regardless of the result, hearing your kind offer has brightened my mood. Thank you, hero. I am in your debt,” Raylow relaxed his hands and heaved a sigh. “Please let the church know of this idiocy. I hope that they will be able to hand a decree decisive enough to stop this country from destroying itself.”***“So it was the prince? Huh.” I muttered under my breath as a bizarre item floated through the air and landed in the palm of my hand. The creature, if you could call it that, was effectively a winged ear, but when observed from afar, its silhouette was no different from that of a butterfly’s. It was an Evil Ear, an inorganic monster created by the dungeon with functionality similar to that of an Evil Eye. The difference was that, while evil eyes allowed me to see through them, evil ears allowed me to hear through them. Specifically, it would be able to convey to me any sounds it picked up within a ten meter radius of its location.Like all other golems, most Evil Ears were only functional within the dungeon’s bounds. The one I had in hand, however, was a superior specimen a few tiers up from the standard. It contained what was effectively a magical battery pack and could operate outside my domain so long as I charged it with mana. It also had a pair of useful skills in Stealth IV and Conceal Mana III. This combination allowed it to remain undetected except in the case that it was in the presence of anyone particularly sharp. So stealthy it was that it could even leave good old Big Boss in awe. That said, Lefi had caught onto the golem’s presence immediately. [1]As its functions were remarkable, the Evil Ear had cost me quite the fortune. Its price was in the same range as the combination of my hot spring and the Japanese-styled inn built around it. Its cost wasn’t it’s only downside either. Its battery took what was basically my entire mana pool to fill, but even then, it couldn’t remain operational for any extended period of time. It was sure to drain through its power supply and shut off if I forgot about it and left it somewhere for too long. Losing its magical energy would deactivate the golem’s ability to conceal itself, which in turn would lead to its inevitable discovery.Still, it had proven useful. Deploying one in the reception room was the right choice. I had suspected that the old, balding governor would tell Nell about the douchebag that had tried to lay his hands on my territory, so I immediately put the device to work. Lo and behold, my guess had been spot on.“That is quite the odd contraption,” said Lefi, as she regarded the golem.
“Heh. This thing’s just a little sample of what’s to come. I’ve got a whole 27 different secret gadgets I’m itching to put to work,” I said in a cocky tone. [2]
“I am sure you do, Yuki. Good for you.” The dragon girl rolled her eyes dismissively before shifting back to her usual tone. “I take it that you have acquired all the information you desired?”
“Pretty much, yeah.”
“Then let us be off.”
“Yeah, let’s.”Sorry old dude. Sorry hero. I chucked the golem into my item box as I began walking by Lefi’s side. It may not look like it with how I’m frolicking about and playing tourist, but I sure as hell am not here to fool around.My goals had been accomplished. I now knew exactly who I was up against, and from his identity, determined that he was likely living in the country’s capital. Hmm… that’s rough. I was originally planning to thoroughly destroy whoever was messing with us, but running a raid on the capital is a bit of a tall order.Attacking any sort of capital city was a feat that couldn’t be done without absolute, overwhelming force. It was sure to be heavily guarded by individuals on par with the hero. I was confident that I could take on one or two of them at a time without issue, but by no means was I conceited enough to think that I could simultaneously face the brunt of the capital’s forces head on and come out alive. And it’s not like I can just sneak in and assassinate the prince either. They’re sure to start an all out war the moment they find out that I was the perp.Of course, there was no way I would lose any sort of armed conflict with Lefi by my side. But I really don’t want to have to rely on her. Especially not right off the bat. Crushing my foes is my responsibility. And there’s no reason for me not to bear it alone. More importantly, I don’t want Lefi to have to fight. I want her to be able to just laze around in the dungeon to her heart’s content. I want her to be happy.The whole reason I sought out to destroy my enemies in the first place was so that Lefi and all the dungeon’s other residents would be able to kick back and enjoy life the way they wanted. Having Lefi fight went against the point of seeking out my foes in the first place. There was no meaning in a victory created through her power.Everything I did had to be done through my own capabilities. And my capabilities alone.“Now, how am I supposed to neutralize our good friend the prince?” It doesn’t look like things will be going as smoothly as initially planned.***[1] Big Boss from Metal Gear
[2] Secret Gadgets from DoraemonEditor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another chapter down, and Yuki busting out the sneaky spy stuff to find out that it was the prince who ordered the raids on his territory. Way to go, dude. Just signed your own death certificate. Unless Yuki just wants to put the fear of God in you. Better pray that’s the way he decides to go. Dunno though. If Yuki was the protag from Arifureta, prince would be dead, no questions asked. But he’s not, so there’s still hope for the prince. I don’t agree with his reasoning for keeping Lefi out of it, though. Seems to me that the quickest way to solve this is have her and him go to the capital, meet with the king and prince, and scare the bejeezus out of them, get a treaty set up, and head home in time for supper with Illuna and the maids. But I guess Yuki has to prove that he’s manly enough for the job. I dunno. Just irks me. You’re a demon lord. Don’t fight fair. Send in your strongest piece right at the start of the adventure. Read the Evil Overlord List for crying out loud. Bah. Now I’m frustrated. I’m going to go vent on some poor unfortunate farmer in Skyrim. Hey. Hey you! Hey! Get back here! I see you running! Don’t you run from me! FUS RO DAH! See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Vacation in Another World
Editor(s): Speedphoenix“You know what?” I craned my neck over in Lefi’s direction and spoke to her as the two of us exited an inn. It was morning. We had just finished up the check out procedure and set off on our way. Our destination was the governor’s manor, where we would meet with the hero, our tour guide. “That inn wasn’t all that bad. I’d even say it was pretty good, in fact.”
“I have little affection for it,” replied the dragon girl. “It fails to match the quality of our home.”
“Well yeah, you got me there.”On the inside, I felt a tinge of happiness run through me. Lefi’s words were proof that she acknowledged the castle as more than just another place to rest her wings. It had become her home. However, I didn’t let my feelings show and replied with only a shrug. It really was a nice place though.The inn we chose was one of the more expensive ones, but not unjustly so. Its staff was highly professional. We were fresh faces in town, but they treated us well and got us a room right away, and a pretty spacious, well decorated one at that. Dinner turned out pretty great too. Most of the food they presented was stuff I had never even heard of, let alone seen or tasted, but it was delicious nonetheless. The only complaint I had was the fact that they had given us a single large bed instead of two smaller ones. The lack of a second bed, in and of itself, wasn’t really that much of a problem. Lefi and I had already lived together for quite some time, and the dragon girl often barged in on me in the middle of my baths because she wanted me to wash her hair. Sharing a bed honestly wasn’t anything special with our regular conduct being what it was. In other words, the real problem was just the way the staff looked at me. I could feel their gazes painfully bore their way into the back of my skull each time they passed me by.And as for Prince Douchebag? I had long stopped thinking about anything and everything concerning him. The whole situation seemed like too big of a mess for me to resolve after just a few moments’ worth of scheming, so I decided to put it off. This expedition’s goal had just been to identify my foe. And that goal had already been accomplished. Which means I get to slack off and play tourist. Might as well save all that mind-numbing, super complicated contemplation for after I’m done enjoying this otherworldly vacation to its fullest. Changing gears is important. As any real working adult would say, “the inability to turn work mode on and off leads only to clinical depression.”“There she is,” I said as I spotted the hero. “Wait, why’s he there?”Guards aside, there were two people standing in front of the governor’s house. The first was our good friend the hero, Nell. The second was the “jolly” old governor, Raylow.“Hey, what’s up, old dude? You need something?” I greeted him before looking back and forth between the middle aged man and the teenage girl beside him. “Wait, is it just me, or do you two seem kinda tired?”
“Gee, I wonder whose fault that is…?” The hero rolled her eyes. “To answer your question, Mr. Raylow is here because he has a few things he wants to ask you.”
“Huh. Well alright, what’s up?” I turned towards the “jolly” old man.
“Good morning,” he said in an informal but respectful tone. “I happened to hear about your run in with a cursed magic weapon, and I wanted to ask you a bit more about it.”Cursed weapon? Oh, he must mean the axe. Hmmm, that feels like quite the fitting name given what it does. Lefi did mention something about it me not being swallowed by the weapon’s curse back when I shut it up, so it’s probably accurate too.“You mean this thing?” I grabbed the axe, which had since become obedient, out from my inventory and showed it to the governor.
“What the!? Governor, please stand back!” The guards standing by the building’s entrance immediately drew their weapons and cautiously turned to face me.
“Cease this immediately! Sheathe your swords!” The old man shouted at his subordinates in a commanding tone. “I’m sorry, please forgive them for their sudden, rude outburst.”
“No worries,” I said with a shrug, “I don’t really mind.”
“Still… is it truly fine for you to hold the weapon as you are? Is it not affecting your body and mind with its curse?”
“Yeah, it’s gotten pretty obedient ever since I tamed it.”My words caused the governor to lower his gaze and bring a hand to his face, and shudder as he muttered under his breath.“How absurd… To think that he is even capable of taming a magic weapon afflicted by a sinister curse.” He took his hand off his chin and looked back towards me. “Thank you, that is all I wanted to know. Could you please put it away again? To be frank, even the simple act of laying eyes on its malevolent form makes me feel nauseous.”
“Wow uh… is this thing really that strong?”
“Verily,” said the old man with a nod.”It is so powerful that I find it strange that it has yet to corrupt your mind.”Huh. Wow. I guess me telling the hero that demon lords were good at handling curses ended up being more than just a joke. Errr actually, wait no. That can’t be right.The hero was intimidated by the weapon, but it hadn’t made her sick. Lefi, seemed to have the exact opposite experience. In her case, it was she that made the weapon sick. The poor axe was so terrified of her that it stayed completely quiet and acted like any other weapon while in her possession. Though it remained unmoving, I could practically feel it trembling like a small animal, which was kind of cute in its own way.Clearly dissatisfied, Lefi tried to threaten the axe into cursing her, but again, to no avail. I couldn’t help but feel sorry the poor weapon and the cursed spirits possessing it, so I ended up stopping her before she went any further. I guess the way you perceive the weapon must be based on how high your stats are.I chucked the weapon back into my magical inventory as I entertained the thought, which in turn caused the old governor to breathe a light sigh of relief.“I already knew that you… deviated from the norm, so let us leave your abilities aside for now. Could you tell me about the man who wielded it before you?”
“Deviated from the norm? That’s a bit rude, but fine, whatever,” I said. “The weapon boosted his stats a whole bunch, but honestly, I thought he was pretty strong for a random thug even before he drew it.”In fact, I’m pretty sure he was easily strong enough to earn an honest living. Kinda dumb, if you ask me. At first, I had thought that the cursed axe was what drove the adventurer to debauchery. But after wielding it myself, I came to understand that wasn’t the case. He had to have gotten it recently. The weapon would’ve long drove him mad and sent him on a rampage to fulfill its desires had he owned it for long.Although cursed, I knew that the axe was an extremely potent item. In this world, even just ten stat points was a large enough boost to create a huge difference in the performance. Yet, just holding the axe gave an increase of roughly two hundred to every single stat. It was insane. Losing your mind in exchange for its power was a negligible drawback. If anything like this ever showed up in an online game, the whole community would go nuts and throw a shitstorm ‘till it got nerfed. Like holy fuck. This thing is B O R K E D.“So yeah, that’s pretty much the gist of it.”The governor wrinkled his brow and started to brood after I informed him of my speculations. “You look like you’ve got something on your mind. What’s up?”
“…No, it is nothing of importance. Your words happened to remind me of an unrelated matter,” said the old man. “Alas, I digress. I am sorry for keeping you.”
“No worries.”
“I would love for you to return to the forest immediately, but I’ve no complaints if you do insist on continuing your activities here. Please, at the very least, do your best to stay out of trouble.”
“So uhhh, whatever happened to being all two faced and shit? You sure do seem to be giving it to me straight now.”
“I figured you’d prefer it that way.”
“Heh. True.” I smirked. Damn, this old man knows his shit. I’d much rather deal with someone that’s willing to be blunt than someone that beats around the bush. “Anyway, don’t worry. The only other thing we were planning to do was see this city’s sights. We’ll head right back home once we’re done enjoying ourselves, and we’ll leave the place exactly as we found it. Right, Lefi?”
“Precisely,” replied the dragon girl. “The food prepared by your city’s denizens is delicious. I would endeavor to avoid destroying it in its entirety even if my wrath was incurred.”
“Never before have I ever been so thankful that our city’s chefs are skilled,” muttered the old governor, dead serious.And so, with our business here done, we waved the governor goodbye and loosed ourselves into the city, hero in tow.<– Prev — Next –>

A Vacation in Another World Part II: The Weapon Shop
Editor(s): Joker
“So uhhh… might be a bit too late to ask, seeing as how we’ve kinda already turned you into our tour guide, but you sure it’s okay for you to hang around us?” I turned towards the hero, who was walking right beside me, and voiced a concern. “Won’t your higher ups start getting all pissy if they find out? Since, you know, we are technically supposed to be enemies and whatnot.”The two of us were weaving our way through the city’s crowded streets. Lefi, on the other hand, had avoided becoming a part of the masses by once again climbing up atop my shoulders.“I really would’ve appreciated you asking that earlier…” My church affiliated companion heaved an exasperated sigh. “But I think that this is for the better. I would probably get in way more trouble for letting you two run around unsupervised, especially if something happened. So I think it’s probably best for me to stick around until you decide to go back home.”Wow. Talk about rude. It’s not like I’d ever do anything unless someone else messed with me first.“Oh, and just in case you didn’t already know,” the hero continued. “I don’t live here or anything, so I don’t really know the city that well. Don’t expect me to be able to show you anything too special, okay?”
“Yeah I got that. But you still know a lot more about it than we do, right?”
“Well… yeah, I guess,” she said with a nod. “So is there anything in particular you wanted to see?”
“Me, I want to check out the weapon shop and the bookstore. What about you, Lefi?” I craned my neck upwards and looked at the girl perched atop my shoulders.
“I would prefer an establishment known for the quality of its food. The most ideal candidate would be one that serves sweets.” Lefi crossed her arms and nodded as she spoke. You’re looking mighty comfortable up there.
“Wait, didn’t you just eat like a metric ton this morning?”
“Hah!” Lefi snorted. “You underestimate me, Yuki. That meager excuse for a meal was nowhere near enough to abate my hunger.”Uh huh… Whatever you say then, princess. I rolled my eyes before turning back to the hero. “And there you have it. Food, weapons, and books. Lead the way.”
“Hmmm…” The hero brought a hand to her chin. “Okay. Then let’s do weapons, books, and food in that order.”
“Sure, your call.”***And so, before long, we found ourselves inside a store specialized in the sale of weaponry. Most of the stuff that was featured was lined up against or hanging from the walls, but there was also a bargain barrel containing a bunch of low priced junk. Sitting at the counter was a stubborn looking old man. He glanced at us, but immediately lost interest and redirected his attention back to polishing the weapon he had in hand. Fuck. Yes. Oh my god, the atmosphere in here is literally exactly what I expected. This. Is. Hype.I felt the urge to pump my fists out of sheer excitement, but refrained. Man, this trip has been nothing but a series of exciting encounters. I just keep running into stuff that gets my heart pumping to no end.The reason that I wanted to visit a weapon shop, despite my inability to use normal swords, was because I wanted to see the difference between my work and a professional’s. As with all creative processes, I couldn’t improve without looking at examples of high quality items, specifically ones I didn’t make myself. I had to know my faults if I wanted any meaningful iteration. As the Demon Lord of Creativity, an entity responsible for making his own weapons, I just had to see what human weapon shops contained.“This place has got some pretty decent variety,” I said.
“It has a good reputation,” replied Nell. She too was scanning the walls and ogling the various goods on display. “There was this one time the holy knights brought me to Alfyro for an expedition. This shop is the one we came to in order to figure out our weapon situation.”As an amateur craftsman myself, I wasn’t able to tell much about the weapons’ quality just by glancing at them. I did, however, have a certain secret weapon that let me circumvent my weakness: Analyze. Through it, I discovered that the worst stuff on the walls had a quality rating hovering around the B area, whereas the best seemed to cap at A+. The stuff that was in the bargain barrels was, as one could expect, inferior. Most of the discounted goods had quality ratings between C+ and E.The sole exception was a single heavily damaged blade. Curious, I picked it up and examined it in more detail. It was rusted all over and even chipped in places. Both the guard and the handle looked crude, unrefined, and unmaintained. At a glance, it didn’t seem like anything more than a piece of junk, a worthless excuse for a weapon that the owner had simply been too lazy to throw away. In fact, that was most likely exactly what it was to anyone that lacked the ability to analyze it for its true worth.***Ancient Hero’s Sword: A blade once taken up by a nameless hero in the distant past. It was once a powerful weapon responsible for the defeat of many a formidable foe. However, it has long since lost the vast majority of its might. Quality: Immeasurable.***Wow. Holy shit. This reminds me a lot of the ancient stuff in Monster H*nter, the super strong stuff that regains its former power if you succeed at upgrading it.“Oh?” Lefi, who had been casually glancing around the store, stopped looking around and focused a curious gaze at the weapon in my hands the moment she noticed it. Her tone was filled with obvious interest. “It appears that you have found quite the decent armament.”
“Yeah, I know, right?”This is perfect. I was just thinking that the axe probably doesn’t have enough volume to be reforged into a greatsword, so I can just mix this in while I’m at it and boom. Perfect. Weapon Transmutation was a fairly versatile skill. It didn’t necessitate that I only worked with a single item. I could fuse as many different things as I wanted, with the only condition being that I had to be able to channel my mana through each raw material. I think I’m still going to be a bit lacking in mats, so I still need to find a couple more. But oh man, I can’t wait to see what comes out of this. It should be pretty damn impressive so long as I don’t mess up.I felt the urge to approach the clerk by saying something along the lines of, “Magnificent, human. I see that you truly understand what it means to be immersed in passion,” while bringing him the blade, but refrained for reasons that could only be described as obvious.“Alright, I guess I’m getting this. How’re things looking on your end, Lefi? Is there anything you want me to get for you?”
“Not quite. While I do admit that some of these weapons have piqued my curiosity, I’ve not caught sight of anything that has me enamoured. I would much rather you provide me sustenance.”
“Fine. Orders received, ma’am,” I said in much the same tone as would an exhausted soldier before turning towards the hero. “What about you, Nell? You ready to go?”The hero didn’t respond. She was too busy staring at one of the longswords hanging off the wall, completely entranced. Her eyes, which were practically glued to it, were filled with longing. It was clear that she was in her own world, so I walked right up to her before calling out to her again.“Don’t you already have a sword? And a pretty good one at that?”Her weapon was a holy sword, one enchanted with a spell powerful enough to block out my ability to analyze its features in detail. Swords as powerful as it were likely so few in number that they could actually be tallied up and accounted for. Hmmm, wait a second. That’s just a preconception. I mean, that’s how it was back on Earth, but that doesn’t have to be how it is here. I mean, it is technically a whole nother world. Holy swords might be a dime a dozen. I mean, why else would they ever give something that important to this sorry excuse for a hero otherwise? “Uhm… well, yeah. I do, but this and that are different, you know?” said the hero.I can see where she’s coming from. I mean, I’d probably feel exactly the same way if I was in her shoes.“Well, I don’t mind if you stare at it a bit more, but don’t take too long, alright? We’ve got places to be.”
“G-got it. J-just give me a few more minutes,” she said with a stutter.Aren’t weapons supposed to be a guy thing? I’m pretty sure girls are supposed to just roll their eyes and lose interest when they see swords and stuff… Oh well. She looks like she’s having fun, so whatever, I guess.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like Yuki has found himself quite the blade. I know he wants to add it to the axe, but something tells me that the sword isn’t going to take too kindly to being transmuted with a cursed axe, much less an axe with that much misery and suffering in it. Or it could be that feeling is the chicken teriyaki sandwich I had from S*bway today. Could be either or, if I’m honest. And of course the hero would enjoy looking at swords. Almost her entire life has been dedicated to being a hero, learning swordplay along with Lord knows what else. She recognizes good craftsmanship, I bet. Wonder if Yuki’s going to be the good guy and offer to buy it for her as a thank you for leading them around. Eh, maybe. Or he could just be a giant dick, buy it, then transmute it with the rusty hero sword and the axe. If he’s real douchey, he’ll do it right in front of her. But I don’t think he’s that much of a dickweed. At least, I hope not. Well, only time will tell. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Vacation in Another World Part III: The Bookstore
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerVisiting the weapon shop had proven far more beneficial than anticipated. And so, with Ancient Hero’s Sword in hand, I was ready to go. The hero, on the other hand, wasn’t. She was still staring at one of the longswords on the shop’s wall, her eyes glued to it like a child to a toy display. I reminded her on several occasions that it was time to leave, but she never did. She would always ask for just five more minutes, or something along those lines. Isn’t she supposed to be showing us around? What the hell? In the end, I had to grab ahold of the sword brained idiot and and drag her outside before she finally agreed to lead us to our next destination: the book store.That said, I was the only one of us that actually made it all the way inside. Lefi had started complaining about how she was starving and wouldn’t shut up about it, so I saw the two off on the impossible quest to slay the God of Diabetes, armed with only a bag of coins, before heading for bookland all on my own. The plan was for us to meet up again once I was done with my business.A thick scent reminiscent of an old book filled my nostrils the moment I opened the creaky door and stepped inside. I immediately began to look around the place. I’d always wondered what this world’s bookstores would look like, so my eyes curiously darted all over. It was dim and quiet. There were only a handful of customers browsing the shop’s wares, which were conveniently ordered by genre. Huh. This isn’t so different from one of those ma and pa bookstores you’d see back in Japan.“Welcome…” An unenthusiastic sounding woman that looked to be somewhere in her twenties greeted me as I entered the store. The way her chin was resting in her hands only seemed to emphasize her lack of passion. Nodding to her, I headed towards one of the sections that lay a bit deeper in the store.The reason I was here in the first place was that I wanted to learn more about magic circuits. My Enchant skill allowed me to endow them to weapons, but it was too limited. It didn’t come with enough circuits to satisfy my wants. As far as I was concerned, the perfect weapon needed to be able to inflict paralysis, burn my foes, freeze them, poison them, or put them to sleep. As a P*kemon Master, I had to be able to wield all five non-volatile status conditions. And if I want to make something that badass, I’mma have to learn me some magic.I eventually found exactly what I was looking for after a few brief moments of glancing over the shelves. That is, I discovered a series of books called “Magical Concepts And You – The Magic Circuit.” There were three distinct books, a book for beginners, an intermediate one, and an advanced one. I casually picked one off the shelves and started flipping through it—“The fuck is this shit!?”—Only to realize that I had no idea what was being said. At all. I felt like a student that had just been told to write a report on reference material so complex it was incomprehensible. Of course, the translation skill made it possible for me to literally read what was written, but I couldn’t understand a thing. The information just didn’t click. Ugh… And these look like the only three books on magic circuits. God damn, working through all this is going to be a slog…I immediately understood that I had to interpret the three books before me as a trial, a trial to test the limits of my passion in my pursuit of badassery. Fuck. You know what? Fine. Let’s do this. You think these measly books will get between me and my fervent dreams? Fuck no! Bring it on, bitch!***The first thing I did after purchasing the books, leaving the store, and chucking them into my inventory was open up my map and quickly scan it for friendlies. Much to my surprise, the two were only about fifty odd meters away. I immediately started moving towards them after double checking to make sure I was headed in the right direction, only to discover that they weren’t alone.“Come on girls, it’ll be real fun. I’ll even treat ya to as much food as you’d like,” said a man.
“U-Uhm… it’s okay,” replied the hero, “we can pay for our own food.”
“Aw, come on. Don’t say that. Trust us, it’ll be a great time. You too, silver,” said a second man, turning to Lefi as he did.
“Yeah girls, don’t be so uptight! Come on, you know you wanna chill with us,” added a third.
“…” Lefi, however, didn’t reply. She instead continued to wholeheartedly engross herself on chomping her way through the skewer she had in hand. That, in turn, meant that the hero was stuck dealing with them.
“U-Uhm… Sorry, we’re waiting for someone,” she said. You do know you don’t have to be all that diligent in trying to turn them down nicely just ‘cause they don’t seem like bad people, right?Honestly, I wasn’t surprised that they were being hit on. Both girls were beautiful. They’re also kind of both ridiculously powerful, but that’s besides the point.
“Hey guys. Sorry, but they’re with me. You mind finding someone else to flirt with?”
“There you are,” said the hero as she breathed a sigh of relief. Hero pls. You’re not supposed to feel relieved to see a Demon Lord.
“I see you have finally arrived, Yuki.” Lefi spoke as she handed me a skewer. “Behold. This is your share of the meat.”
“Oh thanks. That was thoughtful of you.”
“I chose to provide you that piece because it was not to my taste.”
“Why the hell…” I started to complain, but gave up and stopped myself halfway. “You know what, whatever. I was going to end up eating it anyway, so whatever. Let’s go, Nell.”
“Oh, uhm… ok.”
“W-Wait, hold on!”One of the men hurriedly reached towards the girl closest to him, The Hero, as the three of us got ready to leave. However, it never reached its destination. I grabbed him by the wrist and locked it in place.“What, you still need something from us?” I smiled as I slowly walked towards the man, who matched my advance by backing off.
“Not at all… sir.” He was a bit startled, so he momentarily spoke in a more polite tone before turning back towards his buddies and reverting to his usual manner of speech. “L-Let’s bounce, guys.”The three men looked back several times as they left. You guys are probably thinking that it seems like you’re missing out on a huge chance here seeing how pretty they are and shit, but that’s only ‘cause you don’t know how much Lefi eats. You’d already offered to treat her, so if anything, I’m doing you a favour and saving your sorry asses from going flat broke.“T-Thanks, Yuki,” said the hero.
“No problem, but you do know you really don’t have to try so hard to be polite when dealing with idiots like them, right? They’ll just take advantage of your inability to turn them down by being even more pushy.”
“O-okay, I’ll keep that in mind,” she said. “But… you really seem used to dealing with that kinda situation.”
“Well, yeah, you know. Stuff happens.” I shrugged as I recalled an event from my past life. But none of that’s relevant anymore. ‘Cause this is a whole ‘nother world.
“Anyway,” I said. “I’m starting to get a bit hungry. Why don’t you go ahead and show us to a fancy restaurant or something?”
“I second the notion,” said Lefi. “I would appreciate for you to show us the way.”
“Uhmm…” The hero blinked a few times. “Didn’t you just eat a whole bunch, Lefi?”
“Whatever are you saying? I have yet to eat much at all.”
“But you ate twice as much as me…”Hah. How naive you are, hero. I mean, just look at you. It’s pretty obvious that you’re not one to gorge yourself. Lefi, she eats twice the amount I do. Twice what you eat is probably just an appetizer as far as she’s concerned.…Er, actually, that logic is fundamentally flawed, now that I think about it. If we went by appearances, then Lefi’s appetite should be the smallest of us all, huh?***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Another chapter of Demon Lord down, and Yuki proving himself an uncaring dingleberry by not getting the sword for the hero. Come on, dude. You know how much you’ve traumatized her by now? The least you can do is apologize by getting her a new sword. Who knows? Maybe she’ll give her Holy sword to you. Then you can have a cursed axe, Holy sword, and a Hero’s sword to make your sword with. That’s be one badass weapon, I feel. And at least these goons were a bit smarter than the dead idiots earlier. That’s right, just apologize and hit the ol’ dusty trail, dude. Old boy’s lucky Lefi was engrossed in her meat skewer. Otherwise, he would’ve been shot down mercilessly, if she had even bothered talking to such an insignificant ant such as him. Is it wrong that I’m seeing Lefi as more of a dom? Yuki saying “Step on me, Lefi-senpai” and stuff? Ugh, no never mind. That thought gives me the willies. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Vacation in Another World Part IV: The Eatery
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Wow…” The hero spoke in a half exasperated, half impressed tone as she watched Lefi and I shove copious amounts of food down our throats. Her gaze darted back and forth between the dragon girl and I as she tried her best to keep her jaw from dropping. “You two sure do eat a lot…”She’d brought Lefi and I to a restaurant open to the general public, and a rather large one, at that. The three of us were situated around a single round table located therein. Overlooking the store and its operations was a slightly older woman with a few extra inches around her waist. Business was booming. It seemed there were too many customers for the lady to handle herself, as she was being assisted by a younger woman, who I presumed to be her daughter. The girl was quite the looker and seemed to carry a sort of sophisticated but cheery aura. Wew. Half the men here are staring at her with their faces red as tomatoes. No wonder this place is so damn packed. “You know, now that you mention it, it kinda does feel like I’ve been eating a good bit more than usual. That’s kinda weird.”
“Wait! Why are you of all people confused!?” The hero couldn’t help but retort in a fit of indignance.
“Well, I never used to eat this much back when I was hanging around the dungeon. ‘Course I’ll find this sudden, ravenous hunger of mine kinda strange.”As far as I could tell, my appetite had never been anywhere near as abnormal as it was now. Yeah, Iunno. I’ve always just eaten as much as the next grown ass man back while we were at the dungeon, but now it feels kinda like I could easily devour twice that. “That is due to this region’s lack of magical particles. The density is far lower than what you have accustomed yourself to,” said Lefi. “There is not enough of it in the air for your body to sustain its energy reserves in its regular manner. Thus, it is encouraging you to acquire it through other means.”The silver haired maiden’s words had been spoken between mouthfuls of the spaghetti dish she had sitting in front of her. She was slurping up both the noodles and the extra meaty sauce in a manner so impressive that it managed to get her a smile and compliment from the owner, who just happened to spot her while passing by. “Wow! You’re slurping those down like a champ! You go girl!”I lightly nodded in the older lady’s direction before redirecting my gaze towards Lefi once more. “Wait, the magic particle density makes that much of a difference?”“Of course.”
“Wow. Honestly, I can’t really tell.”
“That is a result of none other than your own incompetence.”
“…” There was no way for me to refute Lefi’s point. She’d hit the bullseye, and no amount of complaining would change the accuracy of her claim. Feelsbadman… Wait a second. Doesn’t that mean that my body’s not actually anywhere nearly as energy efficient as I thought it was? I’ve already eaten way more than a single person ever should in one sitting, but I’m still not feeling anywhere remotely close to full. “Oh yeah, speaking of magic and stuff, that reminds me.” I turned towards the hero. “Why was that old governor dude all worked up about that magic blade anyway?”Naturally, I kept my hands moving as I spoke to her. I wrapped a piece of meat that resembled teriyaki chicken inside a piece of some sort of vegetable that resembled lettuce, topped it off with tomato-like fruit and a cheese-like substance before cutting out a piece of what looked like a burger and extracting it from the bread-like thing it had wrapped around it. I then stabbed both the lettuce wrap I’d made and the meat I’d cut with a fork and crammed it all into my mouth. I had no idea what any of the ingredients used actually were, but I found myself enjoying them nonetheless. Oh man, burgers sure are great. Anyone that’s had actual burgers overseas should know exactly what I mean. ‘Course, I’m talking about the stuff you find at restaurants, not fast food joints. Why do the burgers served as fast food taste so much worse anyway? God damn enigma if you ask me.“Well…” The hero paused for a moment to think. “It’s not anything super confidential, so I guess there won’t be any harm in telling you. The truth is, stuff like that has been happening a lot lately.”“Oh?” I stopped shoveling food down my throat and looked towards the hero with interest. “So what you’re telling me is that there are more cursed magic weapons just like the axe I picked up?”
“No, that’s not what I meant,” replied the hero. “The only person with a cursed magic blade was the one you defeated yesterday. The part that’s similar is that the axe you picked up can make people go crazy. This city’s been experiencing a bunch of weird cases involving insanity lately. There’ve been two main types of cases. The first involves people known to be straight-laced, hard workers suddenly picking up weapons and killing people. The second is where people go on rampages and throw incoherent fits. Governor Raylow was thinking that it might have something to do with drugs or other similar substances, but he hasn’t gotten any tangible evidence.”“You sure it’s not just happenstance?” I asked.
“Apparently not.” The hero shook her head from side to side. “The governor said it couldn’t be. The incidents started with the month and there’s been far too many of them for it to just be a coincidence.”
“I see.”
“Oh, and do you remember the guy you got the enchanted axe from?”
“Yeah? What about him?”
“Well, magically enhanced weapons with curses that powerful almost never appear on the market. They’re really, really hard to get, so the guards questioned him about it when they first saw him hoisting it around. Apparently, he said that someone had given it to him.”
“I see. I think I’m starting to get what’s going on,” I said with a nod. It looks like someone’s sneaking around behind the scenes and handing out items like that enchanted axe, items that make people lose their minds. “So that’s why there are so many guards up and about?” I glanced outside and just so happened to see one of the governor’s patrols pass by. The group I spotted had three men in it, each in a suit of armour. Huh. And here I was thinking that this was normal. “So you guys think there’s someone out to destroy the city or something?”
“Just you guys.”
“Oh come on…” I rolled my eyes. “We’re totally innocent here. I’ve already told you guys that I’m not here to kill anyone or mess the damned place up. And more than once, at that.”
“Yeah, I know,” replied the hero. “Your methods would probably be a whole lot more straightforward.”I couldn’t deny her claim. Yeah, if I wanted to blow this place up, I’d probably just summon a bunch of monsters and have them flatten it overnight or something. Cheap dungeon monsters probably ain’t gonna do much to the monsters living in the Wicked Forest, but they’re still a fair bit stronger than humans. “So yeah, be careful! I know Yuki will probably be okay, but you’ll definitely want to stay on your toes, Lefi. The city can be a real dangerous place for a girl like you.”
“Uhhh… Yeah…” I agreed with the hero in an awkward, forced tone. Right… We never did tell her that Lefi’s the Supreme Dragon. “You hear that Lefi? She’s telling you to be careful.”
“Be careful?” The world’s most powerful dragon furrowed her brows in confusion. “What exactly must I remain cautious of? Eating more than my stomach can handle, perhaps?”
“Uhhhhh… yeah, sure. Let’s go with that.” I gave a half hearted reply to the girl that had clearly been more focused on the food than the conversation it came with.
“That’s really not what I meant…”The hero slumped her shoulders and heaved an exasperated sigh. Yeah, I getcha, but don’t worry Nell. Lefi’s probably at least a couple hundred times stronger than you think she is.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like the hero is learning the hard way that feeding Lefi and Yuki is going to cost her quite a bit in the short and long run. Hope being the hero means she gets a fat paycheck. Probably not, though. So that’s a shame. That sword she wanted just got further away. Also, before I forget, hope everyone had a Merry Christmas. I sure did. Got quite a bit of moola myself, plus got my car inspected and registered for another year. So there’s 100 bucks I saved. Woohoo. More money for light novels. Shame neither TSKD or Jingai have gotten licensed yet. Hopefully one day soon. Those would be instant buys for me. Unless I ran out of money that check and would have to wait. Which would suck. Save your money, kids. That’s another one of Joker’s Life Lessons. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Nightfall in Alfyro
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerThe sun began to set and the moon began to rise as evening descended upon the city. It was twilight, and the sky was dyed in a brilliant mix of orange and black to match. Most of the city’s population had retreated indoors.Its streets weren’t nearly as populated as they’d been during the day. The few people that wandered about were far less rushed. In fact, they almost seemed to blend into the backdrop. The whole town had taken on a more relaxed atmosphere. Its emptier streets and beautiful architecture came together to form a cityscape I could only describe as enchanting. The experience was so magical I could almost hear the town’s evening BGM.Like everyone else still outdoors, Lefi and I had also melded into the scenery. We walked side by side as we slowly made our way towards the inn we had stayed at the night before.We had already bid the hero farewell—at least for the day. Surprisingly, she seemed to enjoy her time with us. So much so, in fact, that she had happily asked us to meet her in front of the governor’s manor the next morning without any sort of prompt on our parts. I guess all that hero training she’s gotta do has made her so busy that she rarely ever gets the chance to kick back and relax. I should probably help her blow off all her excess stress. Guess I’ll have to figure out a good way to entertain her next time she hits up the dungeon.“I have to say,” said Lefi, breaking the silence. “I cannot help but label it a shame that we are the only two of the dungeon’s inhabitants to partake in this experience.”“Yeah, true. Having them here would’ve made this trip a whole lot more lively.” A bit of a smile appeared on my face as I imagined the scenario. I could practically see Illuna excitedly dash around the alleyways while Lyuu chased her with a look of panic plastered all over her face all the while. Unlike the two overly energetic hooligans, Leila would probably stand by and keep an eye on them with a smile.Rir and Shii though… yeah, no. The only possible thing I could imagine the two of them doing was causing a huge uproar. The same went for the three wraith girls.“Heh.” I chuckled a bit as I imagined the mess they would cause.
“What is it?”
“Nah, nothing too important.” I paused for a moment. “It’s just that… I really didn’t expect you of all people to say that.”
“I concur.” Lefi nodded. The smile on her face was a bit of an awkward one. It was clear from her expression that even she found it strange. “Never once had I ever imagined that I would one day long for the presence of another.”
“Yeah, true.” I led my reply with a shrug. “But honestly, I’m liking this whole just you and me thing a good bit too. It’s been a long time since we’ve had anything more than just a moment to ourselves.”
“T-That, I cannot refute.” The dragon girl stuttered as she did her best to keep a grip on her composure. “And I daresay, I find it strange that I have known you for no more than half a year. It feels as if you have been by my side for decades.”
“Right? Those are some mighty fine words right there. Almost makes me think you actually do more than just laze around all day.”
“That claim is one that you make for the sole reason that you knew not what my days were like prior to my relocation. My former nest was one in which I spent many a day naught but drifting back and forth between this land and the land of dreams.”
“Wait. You’re saying you’re actually being less lazy now…?”
“Precisely. I have spent my time in your presence expending much more energy than I have in the period that preceded it. It cannot be helped that I find myself too drained to assist you with the housework.”
“Talk about faulty logic…” I turned towards the dragon girl and flashed her a wry smile.We continued our journey in silence, basking in the city’s warm atmosphere as we did. But alas, the silence was broken.By a scream.A woman wearing clothes typical of an adult out to enjoy the city’s nightlife shrieked like a banshee as she came tumbling out of a nearby alleyway. After her chased a man holding a bloodstained knife. Oh man, look at those eyes. That guy’s totally lost it.Adding to the effect were the dry groans that leaked from the man’s lips. God. Fucking. Damn. It. Man, today was going so well. But noooo, this asshole has to show up and spoil it. “Fuck you! And fuck that stupid ass bucket of cold water you ruined my mood with too!” I shouted as I picked up a nearby rock and whipped it at his face. The projectile whizzed through the air and almost seemed to dig into the side of his skull as it hit him dead on.Unable to defend himself from the sudden attack, the man was sent flying into a nearby building, where he promptly collapsed. The wound was a pretty heavy one. There was blood everywhere. I was sure that the man had either died or suffered a concussion. But much to my surprise, he got right back up.His head twisted towards me in an unnatural, eerie fashion as his body rose in a manner that almost made me think of a jiangshi.“The fuck? That’s hella creepy,” I said.
“You would do well to activate your Magic Eye,” advised Lefi.
“Uhhhh… suuure…”I followed Lefi’s instructions and looked towards the crazy dude with the skill active. The hell? His whole body’s covered in some sort of magical energy. It almost looks like it’s binding him.“I believe it would not be incorrect to declare the man before you a corpse,” she said.
“You serious?”
“Indeed. Necromancers are amongst the enemies I’ve faced in the past. The spirits they employ are restrained by mana. The fetters that bind him remind me much of their work.”
“I see…” I nodded. Alright, yeah. I get it now. Dude’s a zombie.Though I had labeled the man as a zombie, he wasn’t operating under the influence of some sort of virus. His reanimation had instead been brought about by a magic-based means. Specifically, he had been dominated. Someone had taken control of him in the same manner I had taken control of my cursed axe. He was practically a puppet.I knew that there had to be someone out there controlling him, but my enemy detection skill wasn’t coming up with any results. Alright, enough thinking, Yuki. Deal with the zombie first. Think after.I frowned a bit and began contemplating my next steps. It’d be easy if the guy was just infected. Virus controlled zombies can be ended with a quick snap of the neck. Or I could just flat out blow his head off and call it a day. But the fact that he’s being manipulated with magic means he’ll probably keep moving even if he’s missing his brain.“So how’d you handle these things anyway?” I turned to the dragon girl for advice.
“It was a simple task. I merely set the necromancers themselves ablaze.”
“I-I see..”Oh, I get it. You have to light filthy things on fire so you can disinfect them. Makes sense.In the end, the only conclusion I came to in the short span of time I had was to overwrite the mana that kept the corpse moving with my own. Fortunately, it had already switched its target and began lumbering towards me. The way it walked got to me. It was disgusting, inhuman.I immediately knocked the creature over and grabbed it by the back of its skull the moment it touched the ground. I gathered up my magical energy and immediately forced it through the man’s head. The mana that already existed within resisted me. But that was all it could do. Heh. That ain’t anywhere near enough juice to stop me.The zombie moaned and convulsed as I continued to forcefully channel my magical energy throughout. But no matter what it did, I didn’t stop. The man’s struggle, however, did. The forces compelling him to motion were overruled. And so, he collapsed. Much like a puppet with its strings cut loose.***Editor’s note: Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, it feels like it’s been forever since I did a proper editor’s note. I know you guys missed me, so let’s dive right into it. Yuki’s been enjoying his time in the city, which is good. If only all the crap that keeps happening wouldn’t. It would make for a much more positive experience for him and Lefi. And yeah, I’d have to agree with him. Illuna would be running around everywhere while Lyuu tried to catch her. Leila would probably look at books somewhere. Rir and Shii, though, probably wouldn’t be welcomed with open arms by the townsfolk. Such a shame. Rir is King Good Boy after all, and Shii is a lovable puddle of jello. He could probably clear the whole town of trash easily. He’s the world’s best recycle monster, after all. But it looks like our resident Demon Lord is gonna have to smash some necromancer’s head after ruining his day with Lefi. Poor guy doesn’t know what’s about to hit him. But I guess he’ll find out soon. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Banquet For the Spirits of the Departed – Part 1
Editor: SpeedphoenixThe woman I saved thanked me before running off to what I could only presume was a safer location. Only after she left did I finally turn towards the corpse once more.“Man. The hell was up with him?” I said as I frowned at the corpse.“I was unable to detect the mage in control anywhere within our immediate vicinity. That, however, comes not as a surprise,” said Lefi. She was angry; her words were practically laced with venom. “There are no necromancers that know basic decency. As such, it is only rational to assume that the caster is viewing the spectacle from afar through the application of a questionable and atrocious spell.”“Any other possibilities?”“The only I can fathom is that this particular undead has escaped the control of its despicable excuse of a master.”“Someone’s sounding a lot harsher than usual today.”“I cannot help it. It deeply disgusts me to think that there is an individual foul enough to desecrate the dead and treat their remains as tools. Do you not feel the same?”“Yeahhhhh, can’t say you’re wrong there.”Voicing my agreement reminded me that we couldn’t just leave the man’s body where it was, so I began looking for a guard or two to take it away.But I was interrupted.Several extremely loud bells began to clang. The sound was so obtuse that it echoed throughout the entire town. The passersby, who’d been curiously observing our activities, began to panic. They all began fearfully hurrying along to their destinations. The leisurely atmosphere we had been enjoying a few minutes prior had vanished, replaced by one filled with naught but tension.“The heck was with all that clanging?” I stopped one of the men that was on the move and asked him about the noise.“You guys must not be from around here,” he replied. “That’s the evacuation notice. I don’t know what’s happening, but the last time they rang that thing was when we were attacked by a huge group of dragons! It’s gotta be pretty bad, so me, I’m getting the hell outta here! You probably should too.”He dashed off again as he finished his explanation. Like everyone else moving about, his expression belayed a sense of panic.“Oh, come on.” I sighed. “It’s just one thing after another isn’t it? God fucking damn it.”I swear to god, the moment I find the asshole messing up our vacation… Like, for fucks sake, why the hell’d they have to do this while we were in town?“Human cities sure do get rather boisterous,” said Lefi.“I know, right?” I replied. “Anyway, I’ll go for a quick fly so I can figure out what’s going on. You mind waiting a sec?”“Very well,” she said, with a nod.I walked into a nearby alleyway and made sure no one was around before activating my stealth skill, materializing my wings, and taking to the sky.***A flash of silver cut through the air as Nell drew her holy sword and beheaded the man before her. Though the wound was supposedly fatal, she continued her assault nonetheless. She drilled a foot into his chest and sent him flying away from the mother-daughter pair he’d been in the midst of attacking.Nell’s seemingly excessive aggression was justified moment’s later. The assailant, now headless, attempted to get right back up, so she positioned herself on top of him and jabbed her sword into his chest to lock him down.“Run! As quickly as you can!” Nell yelled at the two she saved while keeping an eye on the creature underneath her.“Thank you! Thank you so much!” The mother held her young daughter tight to her chest and began to run.Nell redirected her attention back to the headless corpse and chanted a spell. “Oh ye who hath strayed from the rightful path, return to whence you belong! Turn Undead!”A bright light enveloped the headless man’s body, swallowing it whole. His groans grew more frequent as he struggled, but eventually, all signs of life left him. And only then did the light fade. Nell took a second look at him to confirm that he was no longer moving before moving on to yet another, similar enemy.The outbreak had been swift and sudden.Nell first realized something was wrong shortly after she parted with the demon lord and headed towards the church, where she was set to spend the night. She ended up running into a hoodlum running amok along the way, so she quickly suppressed him in order to prevent him from causing any further harm.She had hit him straight in the solar plexus with enough force to knock a well built man out cold. There was no reason for him not to be incapacitated. And it was for that reason that she found herself caught completely off guard by the fact that he had kept moving. In fact, she was so surprised by the unexpected event that she couldn’t stop herself from drawing her blade and tearing a hole in his gut. It was purely a reflex. Oh crap! Did I just kill him!?She panicked. The blow she delivered was fatal. It’d split his stomach and caused his guts to spill all over. She had thought that she had made the mistake of slaying someone that had just happened to get a bit too rowdy.But her worries were soon completely blown away. By the fact that it didn’t have any effect on the man’s actions. The hero slashed at the hoodlum once again. This time, she aimed at his neck and sent his head rolling. But still, he continued to move.Shivers shot up Nell’s spine. All the hairs on her body began standing on end at the unnatural sight before her. The man was dead. She had personally delivered two fatal strikes. And because she was so certain of his lack of life, she came to understand that the man was no mere hoodlum, that he was a member of the undead.Undead creatures were known to hold nothing but envy for the living. Yet, they were drawn to life like moths to flame. They attacked the living and ate their flesh in a desperate attempt to restore the life energy within them. But no matter how much they consumed, no matter how much they longed to live, they would forever be unable to escape the fetters of death. Their plight was so hopeless that it was almost pitiful.Nell could handle a single undead on her own, but similar cases had quickly started springing up all over the city. A blink of an eye was all it took for Alfyro to start overflowing with walking corpses.There were two key factors that led to the spread of the undead plague. The first was that the undead brought great trouble to those that wished to deal with them. Their attacks contained little power, and their movements were slow and sluggish. But unlike monsters, they were more difficult to identify. As most of the corpses were human, many found themselves in circumstances in which they were under attack by their former companions. Some found themselves unable to fight back, either because they were caught by surprise or simply unwilling, but whatever the case, the end result was the same: the creation of more corpses.The second reason the city was overrun was because, for whatever reason, those that fell the to the undead joined their ranks, which, as far as Nell was concerned, made little sense.Undead creatures were only supposed to spawn if a specific set of conditions were fulfilled. That is, they required magical particles to interact with the vestiges of those that died with their hearts filled with regret. None knew exactly how the process worked, but circumstantial evidence had led scholars to conclude that they only frequently spawned in the war theatres of old and areas with a high concentration of magical particles.Alfyro was neither.If a city like Alfyro spawned undead this often, then its cemetery would likely be a literal hellscape. Its gates would lead straight to the netherworld, where corpses roamed free. But that wasn’t the case. There was no way that the creatures assaulting the town’s inhabitants had spawned through natural means.There had to be some sort of artificial aspect at play.She had no proof to support her hypothesis, but she was certain that, at the very least, something was off. I sure wish Yuki and Lefi were here.The hero found herself thinking of the pair that she had been with only a few minutes prior. She could practically see the man grin at her while the girl by his side watched over him with an expression that mixed both joy and exasperation. There was no doubt in her heart that their smiles would restore her confidence, and that they would be able to resolve the situation in the blink of an eye while she was still frozen stiff, completely dumbfounded by their antics. But I can’t just keep relying on them. Nell closed her eyes and took a deep breath as she finished off another undead. I have to start thinking for myself and taking things into my own hands. Which means, first things first, I should save as many people as I can!Divine blade and holy magic in tow, the hero headed straight towards the city’s centre—the place from which she heard the most screams. The look on her face made her feelings immediately obvious. It was a do or die scenario. And she had resolved herself for both possible outcomes.<– Prev — Next –>

A Banquet for the Spirits of the Departed — Part 2
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“Keep the formation intact!” Gamdia Roston roared an order to his subordinates as he kept his eye on the situation. “Don’t let a single one of the undead slip by!!”
“Sir! Yes sir!” The men that served under him reciprocated with equally vigorous shouts of their own. Each voice contained such a strong force of will that, combined, they almost came off as indomitable.The soldiers-cum-guards were gathered in front of the governor’s manor and positioned such that their ranks came together to form a phalanx. Every last man and boy bore a greatshield with which they weathered the relentless undead assault. They remained almost entirely on the defensive, but their actions weren’t in vain. Their allies, the town’s mages and adventurers, worked to suppress the undead by rendering them incapable of any further movement as the guards continued to hold the line.Adventurers and guards often failed to see eye to eye. The former group was a lot rougher around the edges, and thus, they were often apprehended and remonstrated by the city’s soldiers. Yet, they stood united and fought as one. Together, those with power worked to protect the evacuees that lacked it. Because they knew. They knew that there was little point to the strength that they worked so hard to obtain should they not use it to protect the city they called home. And thus, they endeavoured to eliminate the undead threat.In command of the united forces was none other than Gamdia himself. Gamdia was a new face; he had only recently come to Alfyro. Many possessed far more knowledge of the city and its problems, but it was he that was appointed captain of the city’s guards. Many of his newfound subordinates began to doubt the city’s management, which had always been known for its love of meritocracy. However, he soon won them over by proving that he was not only honest and straightforward, but also skilled enough to justify his rank. His instructions were precise and the man himself was more than just a force to be reckoned with. In fact, he found himself acknowledged by not only the guards, but the rest of Alfyro’s citizens as well.While Gamdia drew a lot of attention, he wasn’t the only notable fighter that had joined the fray. The city’s governor, Raylow Lurubia, had done exactly the same. His subordinates had desperately pleaded for him to retreat, but Raylow had ignored them and joined the ranks of the adventurers and soldiers fighting off the zombie hoard. He too was a part of the task force defending the shelter to which the citizens evacuated: his manor.“Master Gamdia, how are we faring?” Raylow turned towards the commander as he felled yet another zombie.
“The undead offensive is gradually growing weaker. We should soon regain full control of the area.”
“Great. We should head towards the center of the city as the evacuation comes to a close. It looks to be in trouble.”
“…Are you sure you wish to join us?”
“Of course. I’m no stranger to the battlefield. I may no longer be much more than an ancient sack of bones, but even so, I can still wield a blade if my citizens’ lives are on the line,” said Raylow. “Besides…”
“Besides?”
“The whole scenario has me seething in anger, and I’ve a need to vent it.”Raylow’s remark caused Gamdia to grin. But as he had duties to attend to, the captain had no more time to converse. He bowed to excuse himself and immediately got back to issuing orders.Likewise, the governor returned to aiding in the evacuation as he worked his mind and considered the scenario at hand. While the undead often sought out and attacked the living, they didn’t tend to spawn in large numbers in areas that humans inhabited. The amount of positive life force in the aforementioned areas was far too strong for them to naturally rise en masse. It was far more likely than not that the scenario at hand was artificial, that it had arisen from some sort of sinister plot or conspiracy.And it was probably one thought up by an individual affiliated with the kingdom.One key piece of information that Raylow had withheld from the young hero that had visited his manor was that Alfyro was a city that was well detested by its peers. Many of the nobles with longer lines labeled Raylow, who’d earned his nobility through his performance on the battlefield, as an upstart. They were quick to criticize him and often ostracized him from their circles.The city’s success only made matters worse. Alfyro lay far from the capital, so far that many thought of it as a hicktown in the borderlands. All sorts of creatures nested near its boundaries, many of which were extremely powerful. The constant, looming threat led to a natural increase in the quality of Alfyro’s combatants. Both its adventurers and soldiers grew more powerful than those that resided in other lands. Dispatching these high quality troops in times of need had brought Raylow countless achievements, achievements that left his peers green with envy. Yet, this was only another layer in the cake.The icing was the incident. The expedition. Unlike many of the other nobles, Raylow had been opposed to it from the start. Those that disagreed with him had sent their troops to the Wicked Forest, only to have every last bit of their investment completely obliterated while Alfyro’s forces remained perfectly intact.Whoever organised the attack had all the potential motives in the world.Of course, the other nobles weren’t the only threats. The demon lord was present as well, but the governor highly doubted that the undead had risen due to his actions. He wasn’t the type to bother conspiring in such a roundabout manner. Raylow imagined that, if the demon lord were to strike, then he would employ nothing but sheer violence. All he needed to do to burn Alfyro to the ground, should he desire it, was to go on a rampage.Moreover, the incidents that plagued the city had began prior to the demon lord’s arrival. While he had no proof, Raylow was almost certain that the many mysterious cases were somehow connected to the undead assault.“…Fine.” Alfyro’s lord muttered under his breath. “I too am a noble, albeit one of little importance. If you wish to challenge me, then I will not refuse.”After confirming his resolve, Raylow took a deep breath and began to speak.“Listen up, men! This is only one of the many crises that this city of ours has faced.” Raylow spoke in a loud voice that stemmed from deep within his core. It was heard not only by the soldiers and adventurers engaged in battle, but also the evacuees in the midst of seeking refuge. “We’ve been plagued with infamous bandits and attacked by armies of monsters! Yet, Alfyro has never once fallen! We have always succeeded in driving off those that wish to destroy us. And today is no different! Alfyro, our city, our home, shall not fall! Let us ready our arms, raise our voices, and purge our homes of the dead!”Morale rose. Alfyro’s warriors cheered the moment the governor’s speech came to an end. Together, their voices formed a thunderous roar so loud that it shook the earth beneath them.Seeing the way his city’s bravest reacted caused a slight but undeniably proud smile to form on Raylow’s face.***“Wow… This is looking preeeeetty bad.” I frowned as I looked down on the city from the sky above it.It had pretty much descended into a state of utter chaos. Zombies like the one that Lefi and I had run into were appearing all over the town and attacking any humans unfortunate enough to cross their paths.So many things were ablaze that the scene was almost as bright as it would be in the day.The city was in the midst of a veritable zombie outbreak. Back on Earth, I had quite the liking for zombie movies. But the only reason I had been able to enjoy them was because they were works of fiction. Stories. False realities. Seeing the real thing didn’t invoke the excitement or interest that movies endeavoured to inspire in their viewers. Rather, the only emotion I felt was pure revulsion. Ew. That guy’s got his guts hanging out. That’s super gross. Please, stop.Of course, it went without saying that the humans resisted. They didn’t just sit around and let themselves get wiped off the map. Armed groups that I assumed to be parties of adventurers fought back against the undead plague. My birds eye view led me to realize that the combatants were in fact quite numerous.More importantly, they seemed to know what to do. Their actions were planned and methodical. They disabled them by cutting off their limbs before making them drink some sort of liquid. The strange fluid caused the undead to spasm as it entered them before eventually rendering them still. Yeah, I figured adventurers would probably be good at stuff like this.Given the speed at which the undead were being exterminated, it seemed that the situation would soon resolve itself. And that was exactly what left me so confused. I don’t get it. Why would the wire-puller do something like this? What’s their goal?According to Lefi, the disaster at hand was man-made, something caused by a necromancer. In other words, someone had intentionally attacked the city. But the way they did it could only be described as half assed.The zombies seemed more like a distraction than anything. As an avid consumer of real time strategy games, I felt as if the current scenario was somewhat familiar. It’s almost like he’s setting up for a second wave, like he only sent this first wave to paralyze the chain of command so he could expose an opening and use it to take control of the city. But that can’t be right. This would be the perfect time for him to send in his second wave. But it’s not coming. I can’t see anything nearby, even from all the way up here.Though he had caused the city to descend into a state of anarchy, the man responsible for this incident simply wasn’t following up. Does that mean that this is all just so he can buy time? But what for? What kind of crazy bullshit would need this large a distraction?No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn’t get a clear picture of the whole story. I knew that I would be able to end the incident with ease if I managed to find the son of a bitch responsible for it, but he wasn’t showing up on my map. I couldn’t detect him with my Enemy Search skill either. Wait a second. Why the hell am I being so narrow minded?I had assumed that the person responsible would be within the city. After all, it was only human nature to be curious about the results of one’s actions. However, further thought and observation led me to realize that the man wasn’t giving the zombies direct orders; he hadn’t assumed full manual control. Moreover, the fact that he didn’t plan on following up his initial attack with a second wave meant that he didn’t have to be lurking within the city’s bounds—he didn’t have to open any gates while someone wasn’t watching. Given the lack of constraints, it made much more sense for the perpetrator to be somewhere outside the city, somewhere he could overlook the chaos while staying out of danger.Realizing that, I directed my gaze outside the city’s walls and began to scan for him. Found you!My eyesight, which was top tier given the fact that my body was a demon lord’s, allowed me to spot a group of men not too far outside the city. They were situated atop a random nearby hill. To any other onlooker, the hill would’ve seemed like exactly that. The men were using a skill or spell similar to Stealth.However, I was different. My Magic Eye allowed me to spot their human-shaped forms. Or rather, the mana flowing through them; I could see right through their petty little trick with minimal effort.I was by no means obligated to help the city or its residents.But I was pissed.The bastards that had put this plan together had ruined my vacation. They’d taken the time that I was supposed to enjoy with Lefi and totally fucked it up. And there was no way I was letting them get away without a little “reimbursement.”My reasons were nothing short of selfish, but that was just what it meant to be a demon lord. You brought this upon yourself you sons of bitches. You really should’ve waited until I was gone before you put your retarded little conspiracy into action.I poised myself to launch off in their direction and crush them, but happened to catch sight of a familiar face right as I did.“Is that…Nell? What the hell is she doing…?”The hero was, for some odd reason, letting herself get swarmed by a countless number of zombies. She could’ve easily shaken them off and made her escape, but she wasn’t. Instead, she was holding her position and attempting to fight them off.Evidently, retreating wasn’t the first thing on her agenda. It looks like she’s… protecting the church? Only after checking the map did I understand the purpose behind her actions.Well… you know what? I might as well go help her. I had already located the asshole responsible, and there wasn’t any real need for me to deal with him immediately. I could spare a few minutes and hunt him down after. I don’t exactly want to see her die. And having her owe me one sounds like a pretty solid idea, so might as well.***Translator’s note: Chapters 1-32 (and 33 to wherever AH left off, those those have been done for a while) have now been translated by yours truly. If you read the asian hobbyist version, I highly recommend that you re-read. There were enough errors to completely distort just about everything important. They flat deleted lines that they couldn’t get google translate to parse properly, the whole thing was dry, and they made this series look like a joke. But that’s all fixed now. I hope. Note that if you’re on an aggregator site, then they might not have updated their stuff, but that’s not really any of my business.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like our Demon Lord buddy has found the fucknut who messed up his date with Lefi. Boy, I wouldn’t want to be him at all. Sadly, he decided to go help the hero rather than take his sweet revenge. And knowing these kinds of tropes, I bet that’ll allow the guy to get away. *sigh* I’d put money on it, but I don’t have any money to put. Only one of these today, so let’s get to the questions. Remember, this question was asked on Chapter 32.Aurelious H asks: What’s your favorite novel? and also one that you would recommend the mostAt the moment, I’d have to say my favorite novel is Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody. It’s got everything I like: Cute catgirl, OP protag who won’t let anything harm his kids, heartwarming scenes, and even some decent action shots every now and then. I’m caught up on both the officially translated LN, manga, and WN. As for one I would recommend the most, it would probably be Overlord. It’s just too good of a story.Remember, that was from chapter 32. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, put it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it next time. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Banquet for the Spirits of the Departed — Part 3
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixThe first thing I did after noticing that Nell was in trouble was to move in her direction as I pulled Hasai, my greatsword, out from my inventory. I stopped above her, dematerialized my wings, and dove straight into the zombie horde.“Huh!? Where the hec—” She was startled by my sudden appearance, but I cut her off with a loud battlecry before she could finish questioning my entrance. I swung my blade right before I hit the ground. The resulting shockwave was so powerful that it blasted all nearby zombies to bits. Huh. Almost looks like confetti.“Y-Yuki!?” she stuttered.
“Hey. Looks like you’re still alive and kicking,” I said with a grin.
“G-Geez!” The hero angrily puffed up her cheeks. “Don’t scare me like that!”
“My bad, my bad.”I casually swung my greatsword and batted away the few battle-capable zombies in my immediate vicinity as they approached. Nice! That one was definitely a home run.While my onslaught had been effective, it wasn’t nearly enough to wipe out the whole horde. There were still lots of zombies outside the shockwave’s area of effect. That said, it served its purpose. It was able to buy us enough time to talk.“Here, drink this.” I lobbed Nell a mana potion; analyze had told me that her pool was about to run dry. She must’ve been using holy magic to purify the zombies or something. That kinda stuff sure does hit zombies hard. Or at least it should if convention is anything to go by.
“Huh? Uhm… thanks.” She freaked out a bit, but was able to catch the object I threw at her without any issue. “Wait a second! Isn’t this a high grade potion!? Aren’t these really expensive!?”
“How about you stop freaking out and start drinking? You do realize that this is an emergency, right?”
“R-Right. Good point,” she said, calming down. “Thank you.”“Ugh.. it’s really bitter…” The hero grimaced as she downed the bottle’s contents. But despite her complaints, the potion proved effective. Her MP gradually began to recover.
“Alright, that should just about cover everything you need, so I think you’ll be fine from here on out,” I said. “Oh, by the way, I found a few guys who look like the assholes that put this whole situation together, so I’mma go smash their faces. Good luck. See ya.”
“Wait, wait! Did you just try to brush something really important off like it was no big deal!?” The hero started to make a big fuss of the situation. “If you’re going to go take care of the culprits, then I’ll have to come too!”
“What about the church? Aren’t you supposed to be protecting it?”I pointed towards the building that the hero had been risking her life to defend only moments prior. Analyze had informed me that it was mostly filled with children and the injured, innocent lives unable to outrun the undead. If not for her valiant efforts, they would’ve long been swallowed by and integrated into the mindless horde.“…Yeah. You’re right,” said the hero. “I can’t leave. I have to protect them. So please, Demon Lord, take care of the perps. I’ll do anything you as—”
“Oh?” I cocked an eyebrow. “Anything, you say?”
“…Huh?”
“Hold onto those words of yours because I’m going to come right back and have you pay up.”
“Uh, erm, uhh… uhhhhhh…” Completely dumbfounded, the hero could do naught but stutter in hesitation.
“What? You couldn’t already be thinking about going back on your word, could you? Of course not, right? There’s no way an honourable hero would make false promises, is there?”
“Ughhhhh… fine…” said Nell, reluctantly. “B-But you’re not allowed to ask for anything l-lewd, okay?”The young warrior was on the verge of tears. Her expression caused my own to warp into a huge, shiteating grin.“Lewd? What are you talking about?”
“…Huh?”
“All I wanted was for you to show us around again once we get everything resolved. The heck were you thinking?”Only after I spoke did she finally realize that she was being trolled. Big time.“Wow! I can’t believe you! You’re such an idiot!” With her face flushed a deep shade of red, the hero swung her holy blade at me in an attempt to rid herself of her embarrassment.I casually dodged it, then leapt into the air, all while laughing hysterically. “Oh, and before I forget. I’m going to get Lefi to head over, so feel free to ask her to lend you a hand if you feel like you’re in any sort of trouble. Just sayin’, she’s a lot stronger than you think.”
“I don’t care! Just go away already!”***The first thing I did after saying goodbye to the hero was fly over to the dungeon’s resident Supreme Dragon. “Hey Lefi! If you head west, you’ll find Nell in enough trouble to make her start tearing up. I gotta go grab the idiots responsible for all this, so do me a favour and go lend her a hand!”I began to move the moment the dragon girl responded with a thumbs up. I flapped both my wings and boosted myself forward with an explosive burst of speed. The wind fought against me and put its pressure on my entire body as my surroundings flew by. I was so fast that the city and its walls almost seemed to blend into the background as I moved.Only then did I finally have them in my sights. Let’s see… three… four… and… six. Alright, six people I gotta take care of.I took a deep breath as I brought myself closer to the surface; I flew so close to the ground that I was practically touching it. Activating stealth, I began my assault. I readied my greatsword and swung it the moment I passed the group by, retaining the same speed all the way through. I felt my blade react with the slightest bit of resistance. And then, a moment later, five of the six men erupted into a rain of blood. A copious amount of the crimson fluid spilled all over as their torsos were torn in two.The sixth and final man had noticed the attack in time and engaged in a quick, tactical retreat. He’d leapt backwards with all the force his legs could muster and safely avoided the blow.“What the hell’s a demonic bastard like you doing in a place like this!?” The man shouted as the magic concealing him became undone. He oozed out of the shadows, which then revealed that he was wearing all black. Man, if outfits could speak, his would totally be screaming ‘I’m really, really suspicious!”
“Nice dodge,” I said. “But too bad, it ain’t gonna do much to help. Die!”
I rushed the man down a second time, to which he reacted with a click of the tongue. He immediately realized that he would be unable to defeat me in a contest of power, so he focused all his effort to mitigating the amount of damage he would take from the attack. He drew the dagger he had mounted on his waist and intercepted my blade to alter its path.His efforts proved successful. My attack still connected, but I was only able to get his shoulder. It wasn’t fatal.The suspicious looking man once again retreated to open up a good bit of distance between us before facing off against me.“Why are you here!? Why’s a demon like you getting in our way!?”
“How about using that brain of yours, and, y’know, thinking?”I brandished Hasai and got ready to charge, but the overly suspicious wire puller had taken the initiative and acted before me.“I summon the damned! Rise from the netherworld and do my bidding!”A bluish white magic circle appeared underneath the man. It flashed momentarily, only to rapidly fade away and disappear soon after. In its place was a group of monsters. The group was made up of all sorts of different species. There were bears, wolves, and there was even something that seemed to resemble a dinosaur chucked into the mix. Monster heritage aside, the sole similarity they shared was that they lacked the brilliance they would have had in life. Their eyes were dead. They were dead. Their bodies were rotting in some places, and flat out falling apart in others. To put it simply, they were zombies, zombies that moved much more smoothly than the pitiful undead assaulting the town. It was obvious that they were at least fairly powerful.“Now that you’ve seen me, you have no choice but to die!” claimed the overly suspicious necromancer. “These undead are several times stronger than the ones you’ll find in the city! They will be the end of you, demon!”
“…Now I see why Lefi said that necromancers don’t understand what it means to have basic decency.”The man was desecrating the monsters’ corpses. It was clear that they were being ordered around like puppets and forced to act on his whims. I could only see his magic as a cruel method of torturing the departed and forcing them to suffer, even in death. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure I send you guys off and allow you to pass on. I won’t miss a single one of you. I promise.“Now go, zombies of mine! Unleash all of your power and defeat my foe!”I dove straight into the zombie horde as the man issued an order for them to attack.The first to lash out at me was a wolf. It attempted to bite me, but I repelled it with a kick and struck it with my greatsword. A bear zombie tried attacking my opposite flank at the exact same time, but I dodged its razor-sharp claws and lopped its head off in retaliation. I was then immediately attacked by a zombie that was so messed up I was unable to discern its original form or even its species. It tried to get my feet, so I stomped it into the ground and used the force to take to the air, thereby dodging the charge of a zombie that seemed to resemble a triceratops. The moment it passed under me, I jammed my sword into the back of its neck and ended it.And so, the cycle repeated. I used all sorts of different attacks to shred and destroy every zombie within range. While they were indeed significantly stronger than the zombies wandering around within the city’s walls, it didn’t change the fact that, in the end, they were just, well, zombies. And as members of the deceased, they were unable to move as well as the living.I had a demon lord’s stats. There was no way I would be so weak that I would struggle to take down such easy prey. Though, that might not have been true if you’d all still been alive.“You’re a goddamned monster.” Shady clicked his tongue as he began getting ready to summon another wave of zombies.
“You think I’d let you get away with that?” I dashed up to him yet again. But this time, he didn’t panic.
“You imbecile! Is blindly rushing at your enemies all you know?” He mocked me, but his expression soon transformed from a look of confidence to one of confusion. “What!?”
“I see right through you, small fry!”The man had set up a trap while I was preoccupied with the zombie horde. He’d woven a spell into the ground, but I’d destroyed it with my own, Dispel Magic, on my way over.It did exactly what its name suggested. Spells required specific magical constructions, constructions which could simply be disrupted with more magic. The interference that resulted from smashing a dense lump of mana into a spell prevented the intended phenomenon from actualizing.The way Dispel Magic worked rendered it relatively expensive. But that was fine. A single cast had been all I needed given that I had quite literally seen right through my opponent. Magic Eye allowed me to get a read on the sort of attack he was launching. I’d known his plan the moment he attempted to set up for it. Bitch please. I’m the last person that kinda shit would work on.“You bast—”
“Too slow!”The suspicious looking man tried to dodge my attack the moment he realized his spell had failed. But it was too late. The momentary pause resulting from the shock of seeing his spell fail was all I needed to run Hasai’s blade through his body.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Yeah, that went about as I expected. Angry Yuki plus big greatsword plus people messing up his plans equals one fine red mist. The last guy tried, but he too fell to the fury of Hasai. Just be careful there, demon bro. Those necromancers always have a last ditch effort as they die. It’s like, necromancy 101: Have a plan for if you die. I wouldn’t be surprised if he came back as a lich or something. And no, I haven’t read ahead because I can’t read moon runes. All right. A nice, chunky round of #AskJoker today, so let’s get to it!Yarsh Naidoo asks: Would you ever consider taking a couple lines from JM and adding your own unique twist to it. Not necessarily curse words per se but something.Well, Yarsh, how d’ya know I haven’t already? Maybe I’ve done plenty of editing like that for Boss Young’un. But the answer there is, no I haven’t. The chapter’s translated by Boss Young’un on on his lonesome, so I’d feel like a right asshole if I trampled on his hard work like that. Now, if there are bits that are hard to understand, then yeah, I suggest ways it could be better, but I don’t inject my personal flavor text into the story. That’s why I’m doing this #AskJoker segment.Gian asks: I do really like death March. Haven’t read the LN yet but plan to do it in a future.Also Overlord is indeed really good, if you like it I would recommend you Dungeon Defense (if you haven’t read yet is really good)Also have you read Damnachi (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) Title is like that but novel is good.Dungeon Defense is on my reading list. I’ll be getting to it when I’ve got time. And I have not read Danmachi, though I have heard good things about both the novel and the anime, so I’ll be checking those out as well. Thanks for the recommendations.dicky satria asks: in a scale of 1 to 10 how high is your hentainess? :v69. What? It was an easy answer and I went for it. Don’t judge me. It’s 5am.Dawn Seeker (proudtobeabrony) asks: what is the most fucked up LN or WN you have readHmm. I don’t really have any that come off the top of my head. Most of the LN or WNs i’ve read have been pretty tame. I guess the most fucked up one would be Overlord, but that’s about par for the course when the story’s about an Evil Overlord being OP in another world.Issac Cunningham asks: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?As much as he wants. If there’s a woodchuck that can chuck wood, I certainly wouldn’t try and make him set a limit on himself. I’d get chucked meself.Anonymous Fairy asks: hey there! My question is what anime are you move interested this season of anime? Mine is Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari (Rising of theShield Hero) because I read the manga and web novel of it.BTW: Good job on the chapters! Thanks!Thanks, but most all of the credit goes to Boss Young’un. None of this would happen if not for him. As for what I’m interested in, right now I’m watching Yakusoku no Neverland (The Promised Neverland), Tate no Yuusha, Dororo, and Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue (My Roommate is a Cat). I’m also keeping up with Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken from last season. All very good shows, but I was most looking forward to Yakusoku no Neverland because I’ve been keeping up with it since the manga released.And last but certainly not least, Anon asks: Does this website have a dark mode i.e. light text on dark background?That’d have to be a no. At least, I don’t think so. I’m not involved in any of the running of the website. That’s Boss Young’un and whoever else helps him. I get the chapters, read through them, let the boss know when I’m done and collect my pay continue on my merry way. So you’d have to ask him. Or here, he can just post it right below me. Hehe… Below me…. I’m an adult, I swear.ST: Speedphoenix suggests using darkreader.org. I’m too lazy to implement dark mode.And that’ll do it for this beefy round of #AskJoker. Remember, if you have a question you’d like answered, or if you just wanna chat, make sure to post it in the comments with the hashtag #AskJoker. Or, if you really can’t wait to get senpai’s notice, you can always DM me on Discord (Our Discord server is on the right over there —> or you can use this link: https://discord.gg/kachrxj ) and I’ll answer it next time (Or when I get on Discord and see the countless DMs).

Wrapping things up
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“Geez, Lefi. You went way too far!” The hero crossed her arms and frowned as she scolded the dragon girl. “I can’t believe you burnt down a whole house!”
“Mmrph,” the silver haired girl groaned. “I see not the issue of which you speak. It has only suffered a minor burn. And it is not as if I left my flames to burn. In fact, I daresay that I quelled them rather quickly.”
“Oh I think you did a little more than just ‘quelling’ them,” said Nell. “You basically caused a whole freaking flood! There was so much water that you not only wrecked the house that was on fire, but also destroyed the one next to it! And that one was doing perfectly fine even without your ‘help!’ It wasn’t even anywhere close to getting caught in the flames!”I returned to the church with the perpetrator in hand, only to catch Lefi and Nell having a conversation that bore a rather strong resemblance to a typical two man Japanese comedy skit.“…The hell are you two doing?” I almost felt the urge to sigh and roll my eyes as I landed next to them.
“Oh, hi Yuki.” The hero greeted me before getting back to grumbling and complaining. “I think it’s a lot more Lefi than the both of us. I mean, just look at what she’s done!”I turned my eyes in the direction she was pointing only to end up resting my eyes on a pair of houses—if you could still call them that. Both were more or less completely demolished, with a few minor differences. The first was totally scorched whereas the second looked like the victim of some sort of devastating flood.“Like, what the heck!?” The human girl crossed her arms and turned back towards the dragon as she continued to rant. “Using fire makes sense, but you really didn’t have to light everything on fire! The house was nowhere near them! You totally could have avoided it!”I’d expected the hero to be mad, but not at Lefi. She’d been quite mad that I teased her the way I did, but her mood had been overwritten. Every last bit of anger had been redirected towards Lefi and her antics.“I see not a problem. I used only as much power as necessary to consign the dead to the abyss. My actions were just and therefore the results inevitable.”
“That’s a big fat lie and you know it! I totally heard you say ‘oops’ right when you cast the spell!”Cornered, Lefi could only avert her gaze; she outright refused to look Nell in the eye. Yeah… I think I pretty much understand what’s happened here now.A bit of a wry smile crept up on my lips as I continued to watch the two engage in banter, or at least that was the plan.“Is the man you hold under your arm perhaps one of the imbeciles of which you spoke?” Lefi, however, was out of wiggle room. She didn’t have any other way to dispute Nell’s point and she didn’t exactly find much joy in getting scolded, so she blatantly changed the topic.“Pretty much, yeah. This asshole’s one of the retards that ruined our happy little getaway.”I released my grip on the shady looking man and allowed gravity to take over. The result? His face promptly ended up smashing itself into the ground. Despite the rough treatment, the man failed to respond. He was out cold. That said, he likely wouldn’t have been able to right himself even if he wasn’t. The chains he was bound with were quite literally embedded inside his flesh.Fighting the zombies that the necromancer had summoned had gotten me a bit too excited; I had only accidentally rammed my blade through his gut because I’d let the blood get to my head. Though I didn’t particularly care about the man’s fate, I realized that letting him die wasn’t exactly the best course of action given that he had yet to reveal his motives. He had literally been just a few seconds short of falling into the abyss, so I quickly grabbed a pair of high grade health potions out of my inventory and used both.Again, I wouldn’t have cared if he died, but the miraculous power within the high grade potions had allowed him to narrowly escape the reaper’s scythe. So effective were the potions that they made his wound seem outright irrelevant. His flesh, bones, and organs all rapidly regenerated right before my eyes. It was like I was watching someone play the whole injury process in reverse. Ew. Actually ew. This is so gross I don’t even know what I’m supposed to say. It’s actually giving me goosebumps.The reason his chains had been integrated with his flesh was because I’d wrapped them around him mid-recovery. He was likely going to need to have his guts cut open if he wanted them removed. Yeahhhh, no way he’s getting away. In fact, he’s probably going to be stuck with those for life, but oh well, whatever. Not my problem. Besides, it’s at least better than being dead.“He… appears to be quite the eccentric,” said Lefi as she stared at the chains. Soooo… uhhhh… That’s kinda my doing and not his, Lefi.
“…Is he the perpetrator?” The hero narrowed her eyes.
“One of them. I can say for sure that he’s probably guilty since he used something that seemed more or less like necromancy. Not sure about the guys he had with him. I kinda already killed them.”
“…I see. Then I guess that means you’re why all the undead stopped moving.”
“Did they now?”The hero quickly explained that the zombies had all stopped moving around the time I defeated the perpetrator. Oh. I guess it must’ve been because I smashed that one suspicious looking magically enhanced item I spotted on my way back over. Our conversation was soon interrupted by the approach of a noisy crowd. The group, which seemed to be composed of guards and adventurers, was moving down the city’s main street. They held their weapons ready and carefully scrutinized their surroundings as they moved. Their expressions, however, revealed that they were feeling more bewildered than they were tense.“What the hell is going on here…?”A man in the group’s vanguard voiced the question that they had all wanted to ask. They had come out ready to fight to the death, only to find that the zombies they were supposed to subjugate had already fallen. They were no longer sure what they were supposed to do or how they were supposed to feel.“Oh, hey old man,” I address the “soldier” that had let his wonder leak through to the surface. “Wait a second, aren’t you supposed to be this city’s governor? Why are you all the way out here? Seems kinda reckless if you ask me.”
“I couldn’t possibly sit at home while the city is under attack.” The lord replied as he greeted me with a nod. “I’d like to ask you the same question. Why are you here?”
“I’m only here ‘cause Nell’s here,” I said. “Oh yeah. Here. This asshole’s the perp.”I kicked the shady-looking douchebag and sent him rolling towards the governor.“I saw him sneaking around just outside town, so I nabbed him. There were a few others, but they’re all dead. Might be a good idea for you to send a few guys over to confirm it for you.”
“…I will have it arranged,” said the governor. “Would you mind if we took the man you have just presented us into custody immediately?”
“Go for it. Not like there’s any reason for me to keep him around,” I said. “The only condition I have is that you guys tell me what he says when he spills the beans.”I wanted to interrogate the man myself, but I had no experience in making people talk. I wasn’t exactly what one could call a fan of gore, and hitting him until he gave in seemed like more of a pain than it was worth. All I had wanted to do was sit back and enjoy my vacation. The only reason I had gotten involved at all was because I had happened to get caught in the crossfire. It only made sense to have the old man interrogate him in my place. He likely either knew how to do it himself or had just the right person for the job on staff. I doubt he’ll withhold his discoveries, especially since I was the one who caught the bastard in the first place.“Fine. We do owe you, both for capturing him and for saving the city. I swear that I will tell you anything he says.” The governor looked over the zombies turned corpses as he spoke. He did, however, flash a wry smile and look in my direction as he spotted a certain pair of houses. Bruh, that wasn’t even me!“Listen up!” The governor turned around and began to address his men. “The threat is no more! However, that doesn’t mean that you’ve the time to lazily sit around and space out. We must immediately shift gears and devote ourselves to reconstructing everything that was destroyed!”The bewildered soldiers and adventurers, who had been at a loss due to the sudden change in situation, began to cheer in response to the lord’s words. The cheers gradually grew louder as the would be combatants overcame their shock and finished processing everything that had happened. And, before long, the cheers transformed into a deafening roar that echoed throughout the city.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, color me surprised. I thought that sneaky bastard would’ve had a backup plan, but nah. Luckily, Yuki managed to rein his bloodlust in enough to get someone to interrogate. And you’re full of BS, Yuki. “I wasn’t exactly what one could call a fan of gore…” my ass. You turned 5 people into literal tomato paste and helped expedite the delivery of oxygen to the last guy’s lungs. Bah. Japanese people always being afraid of gore… whooooo, the Nyquil is kickin’ in something fierce. Let’s get to the #AskJoker segment now before I pass out.Teddy asks: Do you know(or have an opinion on) why Yuki just killed off the necromancers? I know he was pissed and all but it feels lacking in impact if he just kills them and not bring them to court then later on torturing them. Maybe he could have brought the corpse to the dungeon since he has inventory to see what happens to them and how many points they give.Well, this chapter sure answered that question for me. As for why he killed the other 5, he was mad. And he probably wants to build good relations with the governor, so that’s why he handed over the bodies. It’s not like he really needs the DP, what with Lefi being there.dicky satira asks: which genre are your favorite tags ? :vare you vanilla faction or NTR faction !?and what are the most fked up hentai you ever watch that might scar your ero life ? :3Genres shall remain a secret to keep this chapter from being flagged NSFW. I’m a hardcore vanilla faction myself. And I did watch an episode of Boku no Pico on a dare once. Needless to say, that person and I aren’t friends anymore.Teru asks: which one are you part of, the plains or the mountains? XDNice, soft, rolling hills. Just right to drive up and over, but not too bad to where I have to break out the 4 wheel drive. Oh, wait… you mean ‘that’. Uh… soft rolling hills. Just right to drive up and over, but not too bad to where I have to break out the 4 wheel drive.Confusing thingy (@DanPamfiloiu) asks: The Stormcloaks or the Imperial Legion?Both. It depends on the story I build up for my character that I’m playing as. For example, a proud Nord would be Stormcloak, but an Orc Mercenary would probably be Imperial.zekkendo asks: Lich: Litch or Lick? I used to think it was one way, then found out it was the other. In my head, I still pronounce it wrong due to habit . . .This was answered by Yashuul below this post, but it’s still a #AskJoker, so… Litch. Jehad Al-saidi asks: What do you think is the most twisted MC and also the author in LN ?
May is Story of a Careless Demon did read it?Hmm. Most twisted MC? I’d have to go with the protag of Arifureta. He’s just too cold for my tastes, even though I know he has every right to be. And no idea on author, sorry. As for if I’ve read that, no I haven’t.Anonymous Fairy asks: Heyo! Me again! Thanks for responding last time since I am normally the person everyone forgets… Anyways! What is your favorite book in for each genre?
-Isekai
-Fantasy
-Romance
-ComedyThanks for the work you put into each chapter! Tell Boss Young’un (is the Boss because he is your boss or just part of the name?) thanks from me as well, if possible.I’ll reply to anyone who posts a question before Boss Young’un sends us the next one. 😛 So, favorite novels, in order:
Death March
Goblin Slayer
Spice and Wolf
KonosubaAnd Boss Young’un is the boss. Nothin’ more, nothin’ less. Does he have every right to fire me if I don’t a good enough job? Yuppers. But am I on a payroll and everything for him? No. But I sure wish I was…Last but certainly not least, Zehd Cashew asks: That was too easy. Do you think their boss is another cute girl that Yuki won’t kill?*looks above at the chapter* Hm. Something’s telling me, no not really. But I won’t discount the possibility that one is controlling the strings from the background. I dunno. Haven’t read ahead.And that’ll do it for this round of #AskJoker. Boy, my vision is starting to split up, so I guess the Nyquil is kicking in. Remember, if you have a question you’d like answered, leave it in the comments with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it next time. Or DM on Discord. Either way works. See y’all in the next chap-! Zzzzzzzzzzz<– Prev — Next –>

Firelight
Editors: Sebas Tian, JokerThe city’s reconstruction progressed with gusto. Apparently, crises like yesterday’s zombie outbreak were common. The guards, adventurers, and citizens alike were already accustomed to bouncing back and rebuilding. In fact, that was exactly what had happened to the two houses that Lefi had wrecked through a mix of flame and water. They had both been demolished and partially rebuilt. Fortunately, we weren’t asked to pay any sort of remuneration despite our direct involvement in their… deconstruction.And, although I referred to it as reconstruction, that wasn’t exactly what the relevant tasks required. The zombies hadn’t been the direct cause of any sort of architectural destruction. Most of the non-Lefi related damage caused to the city’s infrastructure had arisen from the fires that had been ignited during the assault. Thus, most of the townsfolk had spent their time burying the dead, a task they had finished in under a day.The evening was thus dedicated to a task that naturally followed the many burials: mourning the dead. Specifically, the town was hosting a festival to honour those that had passed in the incident. Once again, the city was turned into a ball of noise. This time, however, it was filled not with screams, but rather the sounds of people eating, drinking, and laughing the night away.Lefi and I were in the middle of all the noise. We were situated near the edge of a large plaza, at the centre of which was a warm bonfire. Like just about everyone else, we were eating stuff we’d bought from nearby stalls.I cast my glance beside me and gazed upon the dragon girl, who just happened to be eating something that looked a lot like grilled squid. Though she was stuffing her face, her charm was clearly conveyed to me nonetheless. She was beautiful, beautiful in such a way that it made me want to describe her as both attractive and mysterious. The way the firelight illuminated her face only made her even more appealing to the eye. Man, seeing her like this almost makes me want to make her wear a Yukata.“What is it?” Noticing my stare, Lefi turned towards me.
“Nah, it’s nothing.”
“You may regard my food all you wish, but I will allow you none of it.”
“That’s a shame.”I broke into a wry smile before turning back towards the bonfire. The centre of the plaza was especially lively. There looked to be a group of street performers playing a series of instruments and bringing smiles to the faces of the people around them. Watching the city’s residents enjoy themselves ultimately lifted my own spirits. I couldn’t deny that seeing them make merry like this made me feel as if my actions were well worth it, even though they had stemmed from naught but a petty desire for vengeance. All I’d wanted to do was punch the bitch that messed up our vacation. But it had turned into oh so much more.I still had yet to find out much more about the incident. That, however, was apparently soon to change. The shady looking asshole I captured was already in the midst of a nice hearty round of interrogation, and it didn’t seem like it would take all that long for him to spill the beans. My condolences, Shady, my condolences. I know you’re going through something that’s probably a good bit worse than death right about now, but it’s only fair. I mean, you kinda totally messed up my happy little getaway, so you’ll just have to suck it up and deal with it.One of the more surprising things about the incident was the fact that the governor seemed to have more or less accepted my testimony as is. I’d expected him to question me and ask me whether I was in fact the person behind the incident, to which he’d said, “You could easily tear this city apart with nothing but brute force should you wish it, so I don’t believe there’s any reason for you to bother with such a roundabout scheme.” Is it just me, or has he started getting bolder lately?The city had a lot to do, and I’d enjoyed hanging around it. The inn was nice as well. That said, none of it even came close to living up to what the dungeon had to offer. More importantly, I felt as if everyone that’d stayed behind would likely start to worry if we didn’t return soon; it was time to go. And the first thing I’m going to do the moment I get back is dive into that super comfy futon of mine.We’d already arranged for the hero to deliver the results of Shady’s interrogation at a later date, so there wasn’t a need for us to hang around and wait for him to crack. I’d told her that she didn’t need to and that it would be fine for her just to head home since she was more or less done with her mission, but she refused on the grounds that she wanted to see her job all the way through to the end. How earnest and upright.“Oh yeah, Lefi, that reminds me.”
“What is it?”
“Here.”I grabbed a certain special something out of my inventory and handed it to her.“Hmmm?” She blinked as she looked at it. “Is that perhaps… a ring?”
“Yeah. I happened to see something that I thought would look good on you, so… yeah, y’know.” I awkwardly scratched the back of my head in embarrassment as I answered her question.I’d spotted it amongst the wares of a suspicious looking old lady a good bit before the incident. The moment I first laid eyes on it was the moment I realized that it would look great on Lefi. I was so overwhelmed by the thought that I’d purchased it before I realized it.All in all, the ring wasn’t particularly complex. Its frame was of a simple silver construction, save for the pale emerald line running through its centre. There was a second line at the top of the ring, which intersected with the first to make a cross, inside of which lay a bit of magical energy. Adorning the ring was a small but beautiful jewel, one that remained translucent despite being dyed a shade of crimson.It was a design that fit particularly well with the dragon girl’s beautiful platinum coloured hair. Most important of all, however, wasn’t the ring’s appearance, but rather its effect. Analyze had identified it as follows.***
Adjustable Ring: This ring’s size will change such that it fits its owner.
Quality: A+
***It seemed extremely convenient in the sense that it wouldn’t break, even if she were to revert to her draconic form.Giving it to her, of course, made me feel extremely embarrassed, but I knew that giving this sort of gift was something that only grew more difficult with time. I’d probably end up never giving it to her at all if I kept fussing about the particulars. And that would just be wasteful, especially since I’ve already bought it.Lefi put her food back down on the plate she had on her lap before accepting the ring. She held it in both hands and examined it, all while bearing a serious look in her eye—only to stifle a giggle shortly after.“W-What?” I asked.
“It is nothing.” She shook her head. “I believe it falls within the realm of tradition for you to place this present of yours upon me?”
“Huh? Uh… erm…. Yeah, I guess.”I tried my best to keep calm as she presented me her left ring finger. Is that just a coincidence? It’s gotta be, right…?I took the ring from her other hand and slowly slipped it on. Her finger was so smooth to the touch that I was reluctant to part with it; I felt the urge to never part my hand from her own.Lefi waited for the ring to fall into place before raising her hand and gazing at it as the bonfire made it glimmer with light.“Thank you, Yuki. This present is one I am glad to receive.” Only after she was satisfied did she finally turn towards me.Again, I tried to keep my heart under control. But I couldn’t. The way the firelight lit up her gentle smile caused it to continue pounding with vigour.***Translator’s Note: I’m looking for people to test a Starcraft 2 mod I made for an assignment. I’m currently spending a lot of time looking for testers because I really need feedback. And that’s time I could be spending translating! See announcement post for more details.Editor’s note (Sebas Tian): Hey everyone, just wanted to say a few things. The 20th is my birthday so this chapter is almost like a gift, I say almost cause ST didn’t know it was my birthday and I never said anything. Wanted to wish you all well and tell you that Lefi and Yuki are adorable sometimes and they need to get hitched soon, this means get married for those of you not quite used to English sayings yet. Don’t feel like you need to say happy birthday in the comments, you can just go read The Second Coming of Avarice to help keep the translator and editor motivated cause I’m really enjoying the series and I don’t want to see it get dropped cause of low view counts killing their motivation.Editor’s note (Joker): Ship ship ship ship ship ship- *external voice: Uh… we’re live* ship ship… *looks at the camera* Oh. Uh… Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, this certainly was a- ship ship ship ship- nice, heartwarming chapter, wasn’t it? Yuki and Lefi- SHIP SHIP SHIP SHIP SHIP- talking around a fire, with Yuki giving her a nice ring as a- SHIPSHIPSHIPSHIPSHIP- present. Yeah, in case you can’t tell, I’m on board the Yufi… *flashes back to Final Fantasy VII* Leki… *has PTSD flashbacks of the live action Lickitung in the Detective Pikachu movie* Yuki/Lefi ship now. I mean, I was kinda leaning that way, but this chapter solidified it for me. All right, let’s get to the viewer questions. Also, at the end, I’ll put a poll: Should I continue answering questions in the chapter, or should I instead respond to the comments themselves. You decide. I’ve been getting some complaints that my segment tends to run a little too long and adds unnecessary bulk to the chapter. So don’t forget to vote there.Isaac Cunningham asks: why haven’t you asked for a picture of my dog??Because I… didn’t know you had one? Feel free to @ me or DM in discord with a picture if it’s that important to you.Sebas says: Also because you’re a stranger and asking a stranger about their pet is kinda rude to do without warning.Confusing thingy (@DanPamfiloiu) asks: in a RPG what class would you choose from the following : Rougue, Thief, Assasin, Warrior(if you choose this say the main weapon name as well : 2-handed sword/1-handed sword/ 1-handed axe/ 2-handed axe(halebard is included here)/spear/mace), Paladin, Cleric, Wizard, Summoner, Necromancer, Tamer, Monk, Ranger, Bard, Berserk, Warlock, Sorcerer.In terms of Tabletop RPGs, I’m almost always a sword and board Warrior/Fighter. Don’t need to worry about making my spellbook or choosing spells for the day. Just draw, cut, and defend. And it gets me out of the boring story stuff. My character is always, “When’s the next fight gunna start?” because his INT stat is lower than normal because I put the extra points into STR, CON, and DEX.zekkendo asks: Are there any LN/WNs you feel are underrated/less-known that you’d like to recommend? I’m really enjoying “Common Sense of a Warrior House” and “After the Ending, the Magical Girl Earnestly Hides Her True Identity” (both on Kiriko’s site) “Second Coming of Avarice” reader numbers seem to be growing (on Creative Novels) And I had a blast with “I Really Don’t Notice” (on Yoraikun’s site)Hmm… Underrated or lesser known WN and LN… I really don’t have any like that. Most of the ones I’ve read have been big ones recommended to me. I guess the only one like that that comes to mind is Isekai Yururi Kikou ~Raising Children While Being an Adventurer~. That’s just a feel good story for me, but I don’t really know how big or well known it is.Yarsh Naidoo asks: I think there’s quite a few similarities between Hajime Nagumo from Arifureta and Yuki. I read Arifureta first and the character similarities was one of the reasons I was drawn to this novel. What do you think of the similarities between the two of them? Are they both seriously twisted?I wouldn’t say twisted, but rather the experiences they’ve been through have kind of turned them against humans. Hajime with what happens when he first gets summoned and the first time in the dungeon, and Yuki with… you know, the whole demon lord thing. They’re both not scared to kill should the situation require it. Unlike other goody two shoes protags who always capture alive.dicky satira asks: alrighty then, another one ! from all the Dere’s which one did you like most ?
Deredere, Tsundere, Kuudere, Yandere? also, have you watch Otome dori ? and what your comment on that one ? since that is my first ero-scar when im being enlighten with the knowledge of Ero Tags after i known of Hentai 😦Dude, we gotta stop meeting in this back alley… I’d have to go in this order: Deredere, Kuudere, Tsundere, Yandere. Nice girls are nice, y’know? And Otome dori, no I haven’t seen it. Sorry to disappoint, but I probably won’t after researching it. Yes, research, not ‘research’. There’s a difference. Yes there is.Anonymous Fairy asks: Me, again… Thanks for doing this whole ask joker thing because a lot of translators and their crew (staff?) are not so communative like this. I also do not feel as bad doing this as consecutive since your last reply so my questions will be quick. Do you know the name of the web novel, light novel, or manga the name “Anonymous Fairy” is from? I like using usernames from stuff. Chat please do not tell the answer if you know. Please. Thanks you for the hard work you and the gang put in!I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying it, so remember to reply to the poll at the end of the segment. ^^ Don’t feel bad about spamming questions every chapter either. Other people do too. As for if I know where your name comes from, not off the top of my head. And after extensive (read: first page for “Anonymous Fairy web novel/light novel/manga) Googling, the best answer I can come up with is Hakushaku to Yousei, or Earl and Fairy. Dunno if that’s correct though (probably isn’t). Sorry to disappoint! *bows* Thank you for always tuning into the new chapters. It really means a lot.Teddy asks: Are you Japanese: If not, what level is your Japanese?I’m not Japanese. I’m a blue blooded Texan boy. Born and raised on the ranch and plains. (Or, you know… the suburbs…) Ropin’ cattle and haulin’ steer. (Or, you know… watching Saturday morning cartoons…) And my level of Japanese is… less than a beginner. I recognize words from my hours of anime watching, but I can’t speak it at all. All the translating is done by ST, bless his soul.Zehd Cashew asks: Thanks for the chapter?You’re welcome?Last but certainly not least, Nicolas asks: Pc or Console?As of right now, console, but I am saving up for a PC. Hopefully this time next year or so.And that’ll do it for this segment. Lots of great questions today. Thank you all so much. I really do enjoy answering y’all like this. Remember, if you’ve got a question you’d like answered, leave it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it next time. See y’all in the next chapter! *waves as the camera zooms out, then stands up and pats his pockets* Fuck, I need a cough drop… where’d I put my fuckin’ cough drops? Answering all these folks dries my throat out like… Huh? What do you mean, ‘we’re still on’? Huh? I forgot the poll? FU-! *static for a few moments. When it clears, he’s sitting in his chair, a shit eating grin on his face* Uh, sorry about that, folks. It seems I forgot about the poll.

I’m Pretty Sure This Isn’t How We Left Things
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“We’re finally home.” I exhaled deeply as Lefi and I finally arrived at what was effectively our doorstep, the cave in which the dungeon lay. “Man, it’s good to be back. Walking through this cave really makes me feel that whole home sweet home vibe.”
“It is as you say,” agreed the dragon girl. “While I did enjoy my stay at that human settlement, I would not hesitate to state that I would very much prefer to spend my time relaxed atop the futon I call my own.”
“You say that, but you pretty much spent just about as much time lazing around on the bed the hotel provided us as you would’ve back home. The only real difference would be that you invested a few seconds towards kicking me off from time to time.”
“Fmph,” she snorted. “You should be honoured that I deigned to allow you to lay by my side to begin with.”“Again, you’re saying it like it’s something special when it’s not. In fact, I’d even say it happens pretty much all the goddamn time. Hell, I often wake up thinking that I didn’t get a good night’s rest, all ‘cause a certain someone has a habit of getting on top of me and shoving their feet in my face in the middle of the night.”“…”Oh, would you look at that? The perp’s not only gone radio silent, but also totally refusing to meet my gaze. Big surprise there. Totes didn’t see it coming. Not at all.“Anyway, moving on.” I shrugged and casually changed the topic in order to give the mighty “Supreme Dragon” a bit of breathing room. “The to-do at the top of my list is checking up on Rir. You mind if we head over to the plains, or do you wanna just dive right into the true throne room?”
“I mind not.”With my next task in mind and the Supreme Dragon’s consent under my belt, I turned towards the door that led to the dungeon’s grassiest floor and gave it a twist—only to find myself faced with a literal swarm of monsters.There were over a hundred of them. Their forms and species were varied, the only commonality I could immediately identify was that they seemed to believe that my turf was theirs. They had began growling at us from the moment we opened the door, much in the same manner as would a feral beast an intruder.“…Oh shit!”The first scenario that popped into mind was the absolute worst possible. I was all but certain that misfortune had fallen upon both Illuna and the maids. And to that end, I drew my blade and readied myself for vengeance.But my bloodlust waned as I heard a familiar sounding bark resound from the castle.“Was that… Rir?”I turned my head towards the sound’s source, only to find the family pet, Fluffrir, headed in my direction. The way the monsters reacted to his cry laid their relationship bare, for they’d immediately leapt aside to provide him a straight-line path to his destination.“Uhhh… what?” I blinked in confusion.
“Behold them well, Yuki, and the answer shall become clear.” Lefi spoke in a calm tone. Unlike me, she hadn’t been the least bit panicked, not even from the get go.Despite my confusion, I lowered my weapon and heeded her advice; I looked over the monsters again. Only this time, I analyzed them in the process. In doing so, I discovered that every single individual present shared a title, one that read as follows.Wolf Lord’s Subordinate: One who obeys Fluffrir, the Lord of Wolves. Those that bear this title fear the Fenrir’s might, are awed by his power, or both. And as a result, they have prostrated themselves before him.Uhhh… What the heck? Are all these monsters seriously Rir’s subordinates?The first thing the white wolf did as he closed the distance between us was offer an apologetic whine.“D-Don’t worry too much about it. I was a bit surprised is all,” I said. “Though, I do kinda want to know exactly what’s going on.”According to the wolf, it had all started in the middle of one of his usual hunts. He was going about his business within the Wicked Forest when he was suddenly approached by a monster that begged him not to attack it. It swore loyalty to him and agreed to obey any of his orders. He couldn’t bring himself to coldly refuse its request given the lengths it had gone to in order to explain its adoration for his strength. That said, he knew that he was a monster affiliated with a dungeon, and that it might not be the best idea for him to issue others orders on nothing but his own authority. And to that end, he continued to put off giving any orders whatsoever despite the incident repeating itself on more than just the rare occasion. The group that followed him continued to grow without him realizing just how big it had gotten. To the wolf, it’d felt like all the upscaling had happened in the blink of an eye.After hearing that he had been tasked with guard duty, Rir’s men had persistently insisted on participating until he eventually caved. And that was what had led to the status quo.Honestly, I wasn’t surprised. In fact, I felt like it made a lot of sense. Rir’s growth had made him strong. Incredibly strong. His stats had long outstripped mine, and he was now able to go head to head with the monsters that lay to the dungeon’s west, the strongest monsters in its vicinity. Is it just me, or does he feel like more of a protagonist than me? I mean, that is supposed to be what I am right? Seeing as how I’m the one that got ported to another world? Oh well, whatever. Doesn’t really matter much to me either way.“D-Don’t worry about it, man.” I pat the wolf on the shoulder as I finally finished getting over my initial confusion. “I’m the one that told you to do whatever you want, and I still stand by that statement. But do make sure you take care of those men of yours, alright?”Rir bowed his head, as if to apologize for any trouble he caused, before turning around and barking at his subordinates. They immediately heeded his command and lowered their stances in a way that almost seemed reminiscent of a group of kneeling humans.…Wow. That’s some discipline they’ve got. Goddamn, Rir. You’ve seriously got to make sure you treat them well. These guys? They be men.***“Man… that was a shocker.”
“It is only natural that he too would come to stand above others, for that is the fate of those who bear strength,” said Lefi in the most matter-of-fact tone possible.I mean, I guess that is one way to go about turning your life into a success story. Swearing loyalty to someone that’s real strong definitely does seem like it’d raise your own shot at survival. ‘Cause like, monsters have got it tough. They have to spend each and every day in a desperate struggle with the laws of the jungle just to survive. Finding yourself a reliable boss honestly sounds like a much better choice than trying to manage all on your own. Y’know, now that I think about it, being able to understand that must mean that they’re pretty smart, huh?There wasn’t much of a point to loitering around in the dungeon’s grass zone for much longer seeing as how I’d already finished conversing with Rir. And so, Lefi in tow, I headed towards the castle and opened the nearest door that led straight to the true throne room.I had yet to greet the wraith girls, but not because I was intentionally putting it off. Lefi apparently terrified them. They refused to come out of hiding in her presence, so I would have to check up on them when she wasn’t around.“Hey everyone. We’re back.”
“That we are.”Lefi and I greeted everyone present as we stepped through the door.“Yay! You’re back! Welcome home!”The dungeon’s resident little blonde girl shouted gleefully as she dashed towards the door. Without dropping her speed, she leapt through the air and dove straight at me.“Woah, careful there,” I said as I caught her in my arms.
“Oh heya Master, heya Lefi. Nice t’see that you’re back. Welcome home.”
“Nice to see you too Lyuu. Where’s Leila at?”
“She’s prolly in the middle of doing laundry. I’ll go ‘n get her right away!”
“Nah, it’s fine. All that’ll probably amount to will just be you getting in the way of her work, so let’s not.” I flashed Lyuu a bit of a strained smile.The next person to greet me did so by clinging onto one of my sides.“Welm. Hom.”
“Yeah, thanks. Good to… be…back…?” I slowly trailed off as I realized that something was off. …Wait, who the hell am I talking to again? The person that had just greeted me couldn’t have been Illuna or either of the maids. I knew where the vampire was. I was literally hugging her as she affectionately rubbed her face against my chest. The warwolf was too far away to do anything like clinging to me, and Leila wasn’t here to begin with.With those facts in mind, I slowly looked towards the source of the sensation.After turning my head, I found myself face to face with another young girl who just so happened to resemble Illuna. If I had to name a difference between the two, it would probably be the fact that one was blue, and the other was not.And by blue, I didn’t mean that she had blue hair, nor that she was wearing blue. I had meant it in the most literal sense of the term. That is, I could see the floor through her translucent blue body.Silence.Silence was the only thing that I could muster as I stared at her, my mouth gaping wide open. Though it was supposed to be my first time ever seeing her, she gave off a sense of familiarity.I could immediately tell that I knew her.She was undoubtedly someone I had met in the past.No, she was more than just that.She was someone for which I felt a sense of affinity, a sense of affection.I felt as close to her as I did Lefi and Illuna.And it just so happened that the number of translucent blue individuals I happened to feel that way about numbered exactly one.“Wait… are you… Shii!?”
“That’s. Ite!”The girl, whose body was as blue as the sea, happily jumped about on the spot in response to being identified.***TL Note: Still looking for more testers and feedback regarding my SC2 map.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Of course the slime would turn into a loli girl. Who wouldn’t have seen that coming? *nervous laughter as he looks around* Certainly I did… Yeah… And Rir turning into a full on mafia boss too. Plot twist, Rir’s actually another reincarnated individual that Yuki just happened to summon and give a body to (disclaimer: I don’t know if that actually happens or not, but it would be really interesting and would explain a bit too). All right, time for #AskJoker. After these, we’ll take a look at the results and see what’s what.Anonymous Fairy asks: G’Day! Good work out there! The answer to my previous question was “10 nen goshi no HikiNiito o Yamete Gaishutsushitara Jitaku goto Isekai ni Ten’ishiteta” it is just another isekai, with internet. Just asked that one to see if you read it before, since volume 8’s epilogue has recently been translated. What is the worst (in your opinion) web novel/ light novel/ manga you have ever read and why? What is the weirdest name you have ever been called? It can be an insult or misunderstanding. Mine was “Bob” don’t know why the person called me that when they knew my name and it did not have any b’s or o’s in it.Nope, haven’t heard nuthin’ about it. As for worst web/light novels, I really can’t think of any. All the ones I read were pretty good. The only one I dropped was Arifureta, and that wasn’t because it was bad. It was more personal reasons. As for the weirdest name, I’ve been called *insert my supervisor’s name at my day job here* before. Which doesn’t make any sense, seeing as we don’t even have the same skin color. Confusing thingy (@DanPamfiloiu) asks: There are 3 jars filled with: Sugar, Flour and Salt each. Each jar has the wrong label on it. How many jars do you need to open to identify the jar with Sugar?One. You should be able to tell how flour looks, so you know that one’s flour. You open one of the others, stick your finger in it, and lick it. If it’s salty, guess what? It’s salt. If it’s sweet, sugar. EZAurelious H asks: despite the gap between each chapter, I suck at thinking of questions that are interesting, I’ll ask you this, when jumping into a new novel you haven’t seen before, what’s are the things you would check that would get you to read it? the description, recommendation, reviews, or maybe the cover if that’s also what gets you into it I guessDescription trumps everything for me. Description and tags. If there are tags I like in it, I read it. If not, I pass. If the story sounds cool, cute, or like something I like, I read it.PIXEL asks: xbox or playstation? and why?Right now, Playstation (PSN: SlopDoggy777. It’s my cousin’s dog’s name. Don’t judge. I was young). As for why, money. I don’t have enough money to blow on a new Xbox One. I’m saving for multiple things. New computer, a trip later in the year, stuff like that.Jehad Al-saidi asks: “are you with translator-sama sect or not??”asked while I glare at jokerIf you’re asking if I’m working with Boss Young’un, I’d say yes? Since I’m doing stuff like proofing and editing for him. As well as this new community manager position that I forced myself into.Last but not least, Zehd Cashew asks: See the greatness of the ship at the cover of volume 4 but if you don’t want to be spoiled or you have already seen it don’t bother. I like the segment during the chapter because it feels like I am being special mentioned but it would suck for those who use your translations to make a pdf or epub. Hmm… How are you?I’m doing fine. Got a cough that’s not really letting go, but it’s a whole lot better than it was, say, about a week or so ago. And yeah, that’s why I put the poll up, to see how the people voted.And that’s all for #AskJoker. Now, according to the poll results… *drum roll* with a score of 127-102, 229 votes in all (holy shit), I’ll be replying to the comments directly! *canned cheering and clapping* Thanks to everyone who voted, and I hope you enjoyed this segment of #AskJoker. Remember, if you have a question that you’d like answered, leave it in the comments below with the #AskJoker, and I’ll reply to it as I check the comments for the chapter. Hope you all are doing well, and I’ll see y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Shii’s Evolution
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“I see that yet another one of the dungeon’s residents has now taken upon a form that stimulates your desires, Yuki,” grumbled the dragon girl. She continued to both poke Shii’s cheeks and look her over as she spoke.
“You and I really need to sit down and talk about what you think I’m into.” I rolled my eyes before turning to Illuna, who’d just stopped glomping me. “So how did all this happen anyway?”
“Uhmmmm….” She paused for a moment before firing off and describing the events that had occured as quickly as she could. “Well, Shii was kinda like, she thinks she can transform! So I told her to try, and then she did! Right Shii?”
“Wight!” replied the slime.The two girls exchanged a glance before turning back towards me, big smiles plastered all over their faces. Damn, that’s cute, super cute. But it doesn’t exactly tell me much about what’s happened.Fortunately, the vampire continued to explain. Because she was just a child, she only ended up expanding on the things that she cared about. Fortunately, it was still enough information to get the gist of what had happened.The two had been playing around, as usual, while we were away, when Illuna tripped and hurt herself. Shii immediately bounced over, and because she had thought that the wound looked like it hurt, she had touched it in an attempt to ease the pain it caused. Her body suddenly began to glow with a bright light the moment she did. And by the time it had faded, so had the cut.She first took on Illuna’s form shortly after the incident. She felt as if she’d suddenly gained the ability to do so, and figured that she may as well try given that the girl had urged her to do exactly that. Wait, does that mean that Illuna and Shii were totally able to talk even back when Shii was still just in her slime form? …The fuck?Yeah, you know what? I’ll just bench that thought for now and come back to it later.Long story short, Shii had evolved, and the instant she touched the vampire’s wound was probably the exact moment it happened.I understood the events that had transpired. But, despite Illuna’s explanation, I wasn’t able to make heads or tails out of an important question: why? But since sitting around wasn’t going to help me solve the puzzle, I decided to check the slime’s stats for myself.***General Information

Therapeutic Slime***…Well then. That’s a huge change if I’ve ever seen one. Her magic stat had grown so much that it was now more than twice that of the humans I’d analyzed in town. Wait. I could swear that the only times we’ve ever taken her outside were when we took her on walks, and the dungeon itself has almost never been attacked. How the hell did she get enough exp to evolve?Leila had explained to me upon the occurrence of my own evolution that monsters were typically the quickest to evolve. From that perspective, I thought that it wasn’t all that strange for Shii to have fulfilled all the necessary requirements. It was possible that she had somehow managed to leech a bit of experience here and there. Still, I doubt that’d be anywhere near enough for her to level up so m—wait a second! Only after another moment’s worth of contemplation did I realize that Shii had a skill by the name of Predation. It was an ability that apparently allowed her to do something along the lines of absorbing the magical energy contained within whatever she ate. And because the slime was pretty much willing to ingest anything I tossed her way, I’d ended up feeding her a whole bunch of random shit. The number of mana-rich afternoon snacks she’d had was impressive, to say the least. Yeah, that’s gotta be it. She probably just ripped the mana out of everything I fed her and turned it into exp. As much as I wanted to believe that I had finally reached the correct conclusion, I still felt that something was off. She’d grown far too much for someone that had done nothing but employ the power of gluttony. If eating was enough to make one evolve, then all the forest’s predators would have long done exactly that. Carnivores ate meat every day, after all. And even those that didn’t prefer meat had plentiful access to a near-excessive amount of magical energy. Most of the fruits and vegetables in the area were practically stuffed full of it.It just didn’t make sense for Shii to evolve at the speed she had, even considering that she was a monster with access to plenty of food. If a few meals were all it took to turn a monster into a more powerful monster, then humanity would’ve long been wiped off the food chain.“Erk…” The dragon girl made a funny groan as she continued staring at the slime.
“What’s up Lefi? You look like you’ve got something to say.”
“I believe that I may perhaps know the cause of Shii’s sudden evolution. It… likely bears a relation to my actions, for I have fed her my magical energies.”
“You what…?”
“I happened to take notice of her habit of draining the mana from her meals,” continued the dragon girl. Both her tone of voice and her expression gave rise to a sense of guilt. “I provided her a portion of my own on occasion after considering that she would likely enjoy it.”
“Your ana. Weally taty!” said Shii with a smile. A. d. o. r. a. b. l. e. Well, that explains that, I guess. I nodded as I accepted Lefi’s explanation as the key to the puzzle. I knew exactly where she was coming from, as I’d often done the exact same thing. But because Lefi was so much more powerful than me, her mana was far denser. Even a tiny bit of it went a long way.With her body in its current form, hell, even in its dragon form, she had so much mana that she wouldn’t be able to contain it if it wasn’t highly compressed. And that was precisely the reason that she had accidentally done in a house while attempting to burn down a zombie or two. She had an excessive amount of mana and she needed to be very careful if she wanted to use it in smaller quantities. In other words, her spell had been more powerful than intended as a result of the dragon girl’s sloppy nature. Alright, that’s enough about that. I’m getting a bit sidetracked.I could finally both understand and accept the cause of Shii’s speedy evolution as well as the reason for which her magic stat had increased so explosively. Our resident dragon had basically fed her steroids. Each dose of her mana may as well have been a rare candy. Speaking of rare candies, P*kemon was messed up, man. Rare candies were definitely just weird drugs. 100% for sure.The only part of Shii’s evolution that I wasn’t particularly surprised about was her race. It made sense that she’d become a Heal Slime. She had always been responsible for soothing our minds. Her newfound ability to heal our physical wounds felt more like an extension of her existing abilities than anything else.Transformation was likely the skill that let her take on her current form. Rir had it as well, but unlike the slime, Rir’s body wasn’t nearly as malleable to begin with, so all he could do was change his size. And although I had been referring to Shii as a her, she did not in fact have a gender given her identity as a slime.“I see… So that’s what happened…” I muttered under my breath as I pat Shii on the head. At first, I had only felt surprise. But the emotion had gradually faded and replaced itself with a sense of joy.
“Master? Shii evolve. Happy?”
“Sure am.” I smiled at her as I continued to pat her on the head.It was true. I was happy. I was deeply moved by the fact that Shii had changed as much as she had. I guess this is how parents must feel when they realize that their kids are all grown up.“Me too,” said Shii. “Look ore ike everyone els. Happy.”Oh. My. God. She. Is. Adorable.“You are smiling as would an imbecile, Yuki.”
“O-Oh shut up Lefi, you’re literally doing the exact same thing.”
“I-I am not! The grin upon my face is merely one that reflects my lack of fear.”Uhhh, that’s kinda weird in its own right, but okay. Whatever you say.“Oh yeah,” I turned to Illuna. “Earlier, you mentioned that Shii was talking to you when she was still just a normal slime, right? Could you really understand her?”
“Mhm! Of course I could!” nodded the vampire. “‘Cause we’re friends!”
“Fweins!”Yeah uhhhhhh… that’s not making any sense. But you know what? They’re both super cute, so I could honestly care less.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Really? A Heal Slime? I guess that makes sense, but that’s a first for me. Unless you count all the potions swimming around in Rimuru from Tensura. And I’m honestly detecting a bit of Tensura overlap from some of Shii’s abilities. Like Predation? Let’s hope that skill doesn’t evolve or get any stronger like someone else’s does. If Yuki’s not careful, Shii will outclass him, so you better get your butt back to leveling, Mister. All right, time for this edition of #AskJoker… is what I would say, had the people not voted for me to reply to the comments. If you left me a question last chapter, go back and check. I’ve most likely responded. Also, to the people who didn’t like that corner, how about this? I’ll leave my replies in the comments, but still thank them here. Like this. Big thank you to Confusing thingy (@DanPamfiloiu), Zehd Cashew, dicky satria, Riajuus Should Explode Immediately, Eric Riveria, Roncy4, Morgana, PIXEL, and Jasonofwolves for your awesome questions. If you have a question for me, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker, and I’ll reply directly to you. Get noticed by your senpai now. So how’s that? Better? People get their names in chapters, and you don’t have to go past a huge wall of text to get to the next chapter button. Yay? Nay? Lemme know.

A New Weapon
Editor(s): Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixA night had already passed since Lefi and I had returned to the dungeon. We’d spent yesterevening giving everyone the souvenirs we’d gotten them and talking, both about everything that had happened while we were away and what we did in town. The entire conversation had actually happened over the dinner table, at which the dungeon’s residents had sat until the day’s end.“Okay! Next!” Illuna cheered energetically as she pointed towards yet another object. “That’s called an apple!”
“App-o!”
“No, no, no! It’s not an app-o. It’s an apple!”
“A…pple!”
“That’s it, good job!”The two girls continued the adorable act of squealing in delight. Watching them caused my head to fill with so many images of cute things that I felt like I was starting to experience Gestaltzerfall. Yet, I didn’t want to tear my eyes away from them. That was just how cute they were. The reason I almost couldn’t take my eyes off them was because one of the two girls was currently in the midst of acting as an apprentice to the other. That is, Shii, who had formed pseudo vocal chords, was learning how to speak from Illuna.Of course, they weren’t the only ones hanging around and doing whatever. Since we’d put everything behind us last night, today, we all went about doing our usual business. The maids were performing their duties, Lefi was, as proclaimed, lazing around in bed, and I was huddled up in one of the corners of the true throne room.The next task at hand was for me to construct a brand new weapon. The base was obviously going to be the cursed axe I’d looted off a thug in town. So with that goal in mind, I reached into my inventory and grabbed the item in question. Though it didn’t try to corrupt and take over my mind as it had the last time I wielded it, it did continue to overflow with a sort of twisting, malevolent mana. The magical energies that it gave off weren’t entirely docile, however, as it did prickle my skin as if to complain that I had left it inside my inventory for far too long. My bad, my bad. I didn’t forget about you or anything. I just didn’t have the chance to get to doing this, so gimme a break already goddammit.“T-The heck is that, Master? It’s lookin’ real sinister and givin’ me the creeps,” said Lyuu as she stared at the axe wide-eyed.
“Is that perhaps the magically enhanced weapon you mentioned last night?”The two maids’ reactions were nearly on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. One was intimidated, while the other looked with her eyes full of curiosity.“Basically, yeah. It’s pretty much obeying me right now, so you don’t really need to worry too much. That said, I’d still advise against getting too close to it.”
“Uhmm… Master, y’sure obeying is the right word? ‘Cause it almost sounds like you’re treating it like a pet,” said Lyuu. “Wait! Is it really okay for you to be touchin’ it if it’s dangerous!?”
“This ain’t too big a deal for me, so don’t worry.” I responded to Lyuu’s confusion with a casual shrug before getting back to work.I laid out the materials I planned to use and gave them a quick once over. The first was the Ancient Hero’s Sword that I’d bought in town. The second, a chunk of metal I’d gotten from the catalogue. Orichalcum.Orichalcum was an excellent conductor of magical energy. Mana could flow through it with ease. The metal was known for being able to not only restore, but also enhance broken blades when used in the repair process. But of course, that was a waste of the precious metal’s potential, for it was of orichalcum weapons that legends were sung. They were so sharp that, according to Lefi, they were known for cleaving through even the scales of dragons, this world’s most powerful creatures. That said, she herself was apparently immune to them. Her scales were far too hard even for orichalcum to pierce. What kinda bullshit is that!?Of course, such a high quality good came with an appropriate price tag. A single kilogram of the stuff had equalled out to three whole inns. And given the expense, I wasn’t about to just chuck the orichalcum in just to do it. The reason I included it was because I had hoped that I would be able to use it to restore some of the power that lay within the Ancient Hero’s Sword during the reforging process. But man, I am seriously short on DP. I’ll probably have to start going hunting with Rir again.“…Is that perhaps orichaculm, my lord?” asked Leila.
“Wait, orichalcum!?” The warwolf’s eyes went wide.
“Yeah,” I said, impressed. “I’m surprised you could tell, Leila.”
“Thank you, my lord,” she replied. “…Remaining here in this dungeon has truly allowed me to see all sorts of different things.”
“All sortsa different things is cuttin’ it short, Leila! Orichalcum is totally the stuff of legends, ain’t it? Though I guess it ain’t too special when you’ve got both the Supreme Dragon and a venerable member of the Fenrir species lying around, huh?”Both maids had basically stopped working and become the peanut gallery. But though they continued to speak, and though I continued to listen, I ended up zoning them out as I placed the materials in a line and began to concentrate.I had to take the grudges that possessed the weapon, its will, and forge it anew into something more… righteous, something that didn’t scream malevolent at the top of its lungs. And I could not fail. I only had one shot at this; only one of each component lay in my possession. If I fucked up, then it was game over. Failure was equivalent to wasting both my money and destroying valuable materials.To that end, I kept in mind the most important lesson I’d learned from creating all the weapons I had.Simple was best. More often than not, making something complicated resulted in failure rather than success. Thus, I focused on the two traits that I really wanted: weight and sharpness. Those two traits were all I focused on. Ideally, I would like to have something done to its appearance. I wanted to make it look a lot less sinister and a lot more dignified. But that, again, wasn’t nearly as important. I only kept it in the back of my mind. Don’t worry. I’ll use you a ton once you’re born anew.Only after reassuring the magic axe of my intentions and refining the image I had in mind, did I finally begin to channel my magical energies into the materials. And then I activated the skill.A groan escaped my lips.The materials, which were of the highest grade, rapidly drained my mana. The amount that it required was far greater than what Hasai had needed. But that don’t mean shit!I grit my teeth, clenched my jaws, and endured. I faced the weighty sense of despondency created by the fact that a massive amount of magical energy had escaped from my body. I faced it head-on with sheer willpower.And I succeeded.The materials almost seemed to liquify as they would in the depths of a blazing hot furnace. The three, distinct objects each gave off an incredible sheen as they slowly melded together to form a single, final result.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Oh boy, oh boy. What will the result be? Something epic, like a two handed greatswordaxe? Or will he fail, and make basically a giant frying pan. Which, if Patty from Tales of Vesperia is any indication of, isn’t that bad of a weapon. She beats the shit out of all the monsters we run into and I crack up every time. And also, here’s hoping a curious Illuna or Shii doesn’t wander over here and fall into the melding items. That would just be… bad. Like, very bad. Like, a capital Very and a capital Bad. But I digress. They’re probably too busy having fun and playing. Let’s check the letter box! *he reaches into a large red box, feeling around, and pulls out one letter* Ah. Only one, huh? Well, at least it’s not a bill. Let’s see… Thanks you to Zehd Cashew for asking a question that someone else answered before I could. Look, I work afternoon/nights, okay? Boohoohoo…. Remember, if you’ve got a question for me, leave it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll reply to you directly. Get noticed by your senpai today!

A New Weapon — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixAs the figurative furnace cooled, the light surrounding the newly merged item began to dim.“Wow… “ I blinked, impressed, before reaching towards the final result and grabbing it by the hilt.The blade glimmered. The light that came from the chandeliers illuminating the room almost seemed to sparkle off its edge. It, the final product, was a blade of Japanese origin—a katana. Specifically, it was a longer sub-type of katana known as a Tachi. Or at least that was what it would have been had its size been any less disproportionate. The blade was so long that drawing it from a scabbard looked like it would be a royal pain. Fortunately, there was no need for me to carry my weapon the same way the average Joe would. I had a magical inventory, and I planned to use it.My new weapon’s blade wasn’t nearly as wide or thick as the western styled swords that I had been using to date, but its weight matched, no, exceeded its predecessors’ nonetheless. The grip, the part that I had grabbed, was fairly simple as far as its design went. So simple, in fact, that it lacked a guard.By contrast, its blade was beautiful. It was dyed a fiery shade of crimson and almost seemed to embody the concept of flame itself.The only thing the weapon lacked now was a name.And I had just the perfect one in mind.“Alright, from here on out, your name is gonna be Zaien.” After christening it, I analyzed the weapon to ensure that it had taken on its new moniker.***Zaien: A greatsword in the shape of a katana synthesized by a Demon Lord by the name of Yuki. This blade despises sin and forgives not those that commit it. Through its blade, which only grows sharper and more powerful as it bathes in blood, Zaien convicts sinners of their crimes and delivers their sentences itself. Equipping this weapon leads to a drastic boost in its wielder’s stats. Quality: Immeasurable.***To summarize, Zaien was a crimson blade capable of judging and punishing sinners. And that was precisely why I had given it the name I had. Zaien was a combination of two Japanese words. The former denoted sin, while the latter denoted flame. Together, the two formed a perfect description of exactly what the weapon was.Its specs were quite literally off the charts. It was obviously not only far superior to anything I’d made to date, but also likely more powerful than anything I would ever make going forward. Yet, according to its description, the sword was still incomplete. I guess that’s probably why it’s got that whole immeasurable quality and all that.Of course, it went without saying that I didn’t mind. Gradually strengthening a sword that only grew more powerful as it continued to cut was an entire male fantasy in and of itself.As for the weapon in question? It also seemed quite satisfied with its transformation—which made sense given the sinister air that had possessed it prior. The thick, grudge ladden miasma that it had attempted to channel into me was now replaced with joy. Its happiness was literally seeping into my being. Yeah, I’d say this whole experiment turned out pretty damn well. I see no reason not to use the hell out of you.“Wow! That thing’s huge!” said Lyuu. “The blade’s got this weird curve to it too. Is it s’pposed to be some sorta cutlass, Master?”
“Nah. It’s a katana.”
“A katana…” muttered Leila. The demon girl was looking at the weapon with eyes full of unbridled curiosity. “I believe they stemmed from the east…”You know, Leila’s got a pretty serious curious streak, huh? The fact that I’d voiced only to myself was one that I’d only noticed fairly recently.“I see…” said Lyuu. “Well, uhmm, would you mind lettin’ me see it, Master?”
“Sure. But you might not be able to wield it. It’s pretty heavy.”
“No worries there! I may not look tough, but I’m a warwolf, and strength is somethin’ that just comes to us, y’knowhat the heck!?” The warwolf cut herself off with a screech the moment I handed her the oversized blade. “Why the heck is this thing so heavy!?”Yeah, that’s pretty much the exact reaction I figured you’d have.Leila and I laughed as we watched Lyuu, who had already started to sweat in desperation as she did her best not to drop the blade. Only after watching her struggle did I casually take it back.“Man, you guys sure are mean…” she said as she panted. “I can’t believe y’just stood there n’ laughed even though I was ‘bout to drop it!”
“Don’t blame us. Your reaction was just so classic that we couldn’t help ourselves,” I chuckled. “Anyway, I’mma head out and give ‘er a spin.”
“Do you know when you’ll return, my lord?”
“I’ll definitely be back by dinner, so make sure you make my share!”I gave the girls one last shout as I walked across the true throne room and left through the front door.***I called for Rir, who had returned to the forest with his underlings, immediately after doing a few practice swings. The reason was obvious. The two of us were to set out to hunt, both to test my new weapon and to earn some much needed DP.“Wow… Not bad.”A few minutes after we started, I found myself standing in front of the butchered corpse of the first monster we’d encountered, nodding in appreciation. Needless to say, Zaien had impressed me. The sword had quite literally adjusted its own trajectory in order to better the strike I had executed. As a result, the slash had ended up literally perfect. It had cleanly cleaved the monster into two equal halves. Wielding Zaien just… felt right.It was in part a result of the way I fought. I had always just relied purely on brute force. I had a lot of power behind my swings, but much of it was wasted. That, however, was no longer the case. The lovely crimson blade assisted me in following through with my attack and thereby put the would-be wasted force to good use. Talk about user-friendly. God damn. And these bonus stats too. Holy crap. My body’s light as a kite. Hell, I feel agile enough to pull off all the crazy acrobatic shit they need stuntmen and wires for in movies. With ease.The weapon’s auto-assist was a really nice feature, but it wasn’t the only thing that left me feeling pleasantly surprised. Zaien was sharp. Incredibly. Fucking. Sharp. The first swing I used had happened to contain a little bit too much power because of how gung-ho I had been feeling. Thus, Zaien had cut right through both the monster and the tree next to it without the slightest bit of resistance. So sharp was the blade that it scared me. I was worried that I would accidentally end up touching it without meaning to do so one day and end up losing a finger or five.I suspected that Zaien’s current state at least in part stemmed from the will that resided within it. It had really wanted to be able to fulfill its role as a weapon, after all.“You’re sharp, you look awesome, and you’re even easy to use. God damn. You’re pretty much the best possible weapon a man could ask for,” I said with a smirk.Zaien once again began channeling its joy into me in response to the praise I sang it. Huh. That’s a bit of a charming reaction. Hell, I’m even feeling kinda tempted to call it cute.You know what? I’m definitely going to engrave a fire-based spell into this thing later. Maybe I’ll go with the one I got from one of the books I bought, the one that ignites things it cuts and reduces them to cinders.Despite eating much more mana, Zaien had, unlike Hasai, spawned with three slots, likely as a result of the ultra high-class materials used in its creation. Wait. Will it be able to do that whole growing by drinking blood thing if it burns things down on contact? Ehh, whatever. I’ll figure that part out afterwards.I had yet to decide on what I was going to put in the other two slots, but since I didn’t have any ideas off the top of my head, I shelved the thought for another time.My excitement had been a little more than just obvious. The sheer extent to which it seeped out from my being had actually caused Rir to smile wryly in my direction. But that didn’t discourage me. I continued to spend the rest of the day testing my new blade out regardless.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, how about that fast update speed, huh? Don’t get used to it though. This was a special occasion, so enjoy it. And now we have Yuki’s main (maybe) weapon, Zaien. Which, if you don’t know, is actually an anagram of Aizen. As in, Sousuke Aizen, from Bleach. No wonder that sword is strong. I guess the Soul Reaper reincarnated into a sword. Wonder how Zaien and Sword-Dad would get along… Hopefully well. All right, time to check the mail box. Let’s see… It seems we got 5 questions from four people, so thank you to Fran Fan (So sorry about you losing your fix. Blame SevenSeas), zekkendo, Tup, and Zehd Cashew for your awesome questions. I do love replying to y’all, so if you have a question for me, leave it down below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll reply to you personally. See y’all in the next chapter, which will probably be out a little longer than this one was.<– Prev — Next –>

A Study of Magic
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker
“Ugh…” I loosed a sort of lethargic groan as I lay in a position that could only be described as awkward. My face was on the floor and my arms were sprawled all over. Meanwhile, my feet lay resting atop the throne. While I couldn’t deny that the groan did have something to do with my awkward posture, it wasn’t by any means the root cause.“Is something the matter, my lord?” Leila, who had noticed my interesting pose, had approached in an attempt to uncover the source of my behaviour.
“Oh, hey Leila,” I craned my neck to greet her while handing her the book I had obtained from the town we visited. My attempts at processing it had all led to no avail. “It’s this goddamn book.”
“Is that perhaps a book about magic circuits?”
“Yeah, pretty much.”Crafting Zaien had sent me over the moon. With the resulting tailwind at my back, I had promptly begun investigating the magic circuits I needed to strengthen it even further—only to be bricked in the face by reality. Being all gung ho was great, but it didn’t exactly do anything to help fill the holes in my knowledge. In other words, I still didn’t understand the things I had started off not comprehending.The three magic circuit related books I had bought were labelled to contain elementary, intermediate, and advanced concepts respectively. I had obviously started with the easiest of the three, but even that was apparently far beyond anything that I could grasp. Even the book on elementary concepts seemed to assume that the reader already had some degree of proficiency in the subject matter at hand.Of course, I knew literally nothing about the theory of magic. There had never been any point in learning it given that I could create any phenomenon simply by imagining it. But now, everything had seemed to backfire. My attempt to turn Zaien into a symbol of calamity, a blade infamous for its overwhelming power, had caused me to descend into an endless abyss of confusion.“Would you like me to teach you?” But just as I was about to give up, Leila extended her hand through the darkness and offered me salvation.
“Wait, you know this stuff?” I immediately pushed myself off the ground, the fire in my eyes burning anew.
“I do,” she said. “My knowledge of this sort of magic was precisely what I used to put bread on the table in the past.”
“Please and thanks then.”I immediately took the maid up on her offer with a smile.***“Do you remember what I taught you about modern magical techniques, my lord? Specifically, the methods by which they are activated.”
“Uhhhh…” I paused for a bit. “I think it was something like… you chant to create a frame for the spell then pour mana into it in order to complete it?”
“That is correct. Magic circuits use letters and patterns to express the very same frame the caster would normally construct with a chant. And like any other frame, pouring magical energy into it completes it and transforms it into a spell,” said Leila. “To equate this to the primordial magic that you are more accustomed to, drawing the magic circuit is no different from forming the image of a spell within your mind.”
“Wow uh, you make it all sound simple. Why’d the book have to make it seem so friggen complicated?”Man, I really should’ve just asked Leila from the start. To hell with the book.“That would be to dissuade the common folk from learning magic,” the maid said matter-of-factly. “Magic is a powerful weapon and an easily concealed one at that. Those in positions of power have mandated that magical texts be phrased in a manner difficult for those lacking knowledge in the field to understand. That, however, does not happen to apply to demons, as we regard magic as a fundamental skill that all members of our species must learn.”In other words, the overcomplicated textbooks were the government’s way of regulating the distribution of magical knowledge. Huh. I guess it’s kinda like how those that lorded over Japan’s Sengoku era would confiscate swords en masse in order to ensure that their reigns remained stable.Adventurers and people working in other similar trades would still have access to magic and pass on their knowledge of it to their peers, but as far as the brass was concerned, that wasn’t a problem. They knew that adventurers were dangerous; they were often visibly armed with all sorts of weaponry. The ruling class felt much more threatened by the prospect of the arms remaining hidden. That is, they didn’t want to have to worry about getting attacked by the average Joe even in the case that he lacked any sort of visible weaponry. Yeah uhhh… I can kinda see why they wouldn’t want that. “As I was saying, each individual magic circle can be split into several distinct modules,” said Leila. She began drawing on the whiteboard as she spoke, one that I had originally bought in order to make it easier for Illuna to study. “Let us start with a simple example in the form of the Fireball spell. The three modules that make up the Fireball circuit implement the functions that allow the caster to create the fireball, establish control over it, and launch it. It is no difficult task to take the implementation a step further and apply a module that allows one to either affect its trajectory mid-flight or alter its form.”Leila had drawn an entire diagram on the board by the time she finished speaking. The magic circle penned by the demonic maid was of the exact modular design that she had described; it was comprised of several smaller circuits that came together to form a whole.“Uhhhh… wow. I gotta say, I’m impressed with how much you seem to know about all this.”
“These are just the basics,” she chuckled. “I must say, my lord, this board of yours is quite convenient. So much so, in fact, that I am starting to lament not having had one to work with in the past.”And so, Ms. Leila’s classes on magic circuits continued.All the magic circuits she taught me were much like the first. They were all made up of smaller modules that could be combined to create a whole. However, they were benign. Apparently, magic circuits could not be activated unless they were drawn from start to end and in a single go; the two ends had to meet before the marker left the whiteboard. I guess that means it’s kinda like how I have to make my mana circulate through my body before casting primordial magic.Unlike primordial spells, however, magic circuits had to remain fairly small scale. They needed to be as compact as possible, as it became difficult for magical energy to flow through them otherwise.“Wait. Do magic circuits have to be drawn on flat surfaces or something?”
“Come again?”
“Like, the whole thing doesn’t all have to be on the same plane, does it? Can’t you like, put different parts of it on different parts of the thing you’re trying to enhance?”The idea I had in mind was to carve a magical circuit into a three-dimensional object, as one would in the kinda software that let you make models. Doing that would allow the circuit to remain fairly compact even with a larger magical algorithm. That is, it would eliminate the mana flow problem without compromising the spell’s complexity.“Well, you see…” I had begun explaining my thoughts to her, but cut myself off before I dug too deep into the weeds. “Actually, y’know what, nevermind. What I thought up is like, super obvious, so I’m sure someone’s already tried it and failed, so yeah. Forget it.”I waited for the maid’s response, but none came.“Uhhh, Hello? Leila? Earth to Leila?” I tried giving her a verbal prod or two in order to get her to stop spacing out. Only then did she suddenly come back from her daydream, but what she did next was something that almost seemed to completely shatter the nonchalant impression I had of her. She grabbed my hand with hers and began speaking in a tone that reeked of excitement.“That’s an incredible idea, my lord! I believe you may have just made the greatest breakthrough in the study of magic in the modern age!”
“Uhhhh. Okay…?”
“Everyone that has studied magic circuits has always assumed that a flat surface was necessary, but that assumption is one that holds no ground. The method you described is precisely what is needed in order to increase each spell’s complexity without necessitating a decrease in the resulting circuit’s ability to process magical energy! I’m sorry, my lord, but I will have to excuse myself! I have something that I must immediately attend to!”
“A-Alright…?”Leila dashed off and made a beeline straight for her room the moment I gave her my consent.“Though I really would’ve liked it if you had at least finished this lesson up first…”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Sorry, can’t really pull out my usual charm and pizzazz right now. Damn near suffered a micro fracture in my right arm, and it’s still bruised all to high hell, so typing doesn’t really feel too good.

An Average Day
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“Watch out Shii! The ball’s going your way!”
“Okay!”The slime girl stretched out an arm in the most literal sense of the term in order to catch the rounded toy that the vampire tossed her way.“Wow! That’s so cool Shii! I can’t believe you caught that!”
“Yup yup! Really good. At this!”I smiled as I watched the girls frolic about within the castle’s courtyard from atop a nearby wooden bench. The two of them had always been on good terms, but Shii’s newfound ability to speak seemed to have brought them closer than ever. Friendship sure is beautiful.Although the slime was still far from being the best speaker, she was slowly getting there. Illuna’s lessons, which the vampire had carried out with gusto, had turned Shii’s fragmented words into choppy but understandable sentences. Most importantly of all, speech now seemed to come to her much more naturally than it had at first.And while I knew that making progress was good for her, I couldn’t help but lament it. The way she so desperately tried to express herself with words she was incapable of pronouncing had been adorable. But alas, the phase had already both come and gone, as per the natural order of things. And despite my many grievances, I had already accepted it as one of the many sorrows that naturally accompanied the act of parenting.One might ask: why, Yuki, are you sitting on a bench in what is effectively a park and staring at a pair of little girls? The answer to said question was, of course, not to observe the aforementioned underaged individuals. Heavens no. My presence was entirely coincidental. I simply happened to decide to sit down after finishing up a series of exhausting renovations, and they just happened to be nearby. There was nothing else to it.Speaking of renovations, they were coming along quite well. I had finished about ten percent of the interior spaces I had created. I only tackled a few things each day, as I was taking a more relaxed approach to completing all the renovations. My castle’s completion still lay far off in the future. The only place that was fully fleshed out so far was its palace-like centrepiece. Ugh… Which retard was the one who decided to make this thing so fucking big again? Oh right. It was me. God damn it Yuki, you’re an idiot.That said, the castle’s incomplete state wasn’t something I was really stressed over. I was in no rush to complete it. I pretty much had all the time in the world, after all. The gradual way I was going about doing it now was much more entertaining. It gave me the liberty to be creative and add buildings or fiddle with the terrain at my leisure. Most important of all, it staved off the threat of burnout.The warmth of the sun wrapped me in its embrace as I bathed in the calming atmosphere. Before long, the combination of the fatigue I accumulated from doing all those renovations and the courtyard’s relaxing mood led me to drift off into the land of dreams.***I felt something akin to the sensation of slowly rising to the surface of a calm lake as I regained my consciousness. It was a feeling I was well accustomed to, the feeling of awakening well rested from a comfortable slumber.“Nrgh…” The first thing I did as I opened my eyes was groan as I was greeted by a sky steeped in the orange-red glow of twilight. “Whoops. I guess I must’ve passed out.”The grassland the castle was situated in had been set to be synchronized with the outside world, which meant that the afternoon had indeed come and gone. Aw crap. I think I might’ve slept a bit too long. I tried to get up as the thought hit me, only to realize that my legs were being held down by a pair of weights. Turning my gaze downward, I realized that the two girls that had been playing around in the courtyard were now sound asleep with their heads on my lap. It seemed that they had tired themselves out by playing to their hearts’ content.Given their current situation, I decided to stop getting up. Instead, I leaned back on the bench and smiled. Carefully, so as not to wake them, I placed a hand on each of their heads and ran my fingers through their hair.The sensations that the two girls gave off were almost polar opposites. Shii was soft and cool, whereas Illuna was warm and had hair that was smooth to the touch.Only after coming to this world did I finally begin to feel like I was actually alive.My last life was much different. There, it was almost like I’d spent my days living just for the sake of being alive. I hadn’t had any particular interests or goals, and I’d never felt like there was anything I really wanted to accomplish. I’d always felt that I was going to live in obscurity and die in obscurity. I would leave no legacy. No one would ever remember me or the things I did.And in the end, that was exactly how it happened. My final moments had been a bit more abrupt than what I had anticipated, but it had all played out exactly as I’d expected. Back there, I was nothing. All my experiences were measured only on a scale of worthlessness.But now, things were different. Everything was tens, hundreds of times as vibrant and fulfilling. The number of significant events I’d experienced in my time here in this world had already eclipsed the number I’d experienced in my last.Today too, I’d spent the entire day enjoying it however I wished. And although I had no solid proof that tomorrow would be the same, I expected exactly that.Lefi had once told me that her world had changed. I had to agree. The very same had happened to mine. My world had once been a mix of greys. But now, it was practically bursting with colour. The colours only grew more and more vivid as time passed me by. I couldn’t help but find them precious. And the two resting on my lap were a part of the many elements that comprised them.I stroked their heads as gently I would delicate treasures before moving my hands to their shoulders and lightly shaking them awake.“It’s time to get up, sleepyheads. You won’t be able to sleep well tonight if you catch too many z’s now. And I’m sure you don’t want to end up like our resident dragon, right?”
“Nnn…”
“Mmnn. Morning. Master.”Illuna didn’t really seem to offer anything more than a groan, but apparently the shaking had been enough to rouse Shii, who blinked a few times before turning towards me with an adorable smile.“Good morning, Shii. Good evening would probably be more appropriate given the time, though.” I smiled. “And as for you, little miss Illuna, you’ll probably want to get up if you don’t want everyone else to eat up your share of tonight’s dinner.”
“Nnnmm…” Despite being warned of the fact that she may end up missing a meal, the vampire failed to open her eyes.Well, can’t be helped then. Given no other choice, I smiled wryly as I lifted her with one arm in order to carry her back into the castle.“Alright Shii, let’s go back inside.”
“Okay!”I extended my other hand towards the slime, who promptly grabbed ahold of it as we slowly moved back over to the door leading to the true throne room, leaving a pair of long evening shadows behind us as we went.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Another chapter in the books, and another little incident we have to add to Yuki’s book of lolicon moments, no matter how many times he denies it. Hell, denying it makes him seem that much more guilty because he’s aware of how it looks. All right, all. Got two pieces of great news for y’all today. First of all, my arm is feeling much better, so typing and stuff isn’t as much of a chore as it was. Second, and even better, I have a new PC! That’s good for gaming! Like, VERY good for gaming, so if anyone plays WoW or SWTOR, hit me up on Discord and maybe we can run some dungeons and stuff together. I’m really happy with it, and am looking forward to playing games with y’all. All right, time for the letter box. Let’s see here… looks like we have four letters today, so thanks so much to ~Fran Fan, kx, Yarsh Naidoo (thank you so much for the well wishes), and Zehd Cashew. Remember, if you have any questions you want to ask me, leave them in the comments below and I’ll reply to them. Get noticed by your senpai today! Hah, just kidding. As if anyone sees ME as their senpai. Hahaha… Hahah… Hah… heh… *sighs sadly* Okay, this has gone on long enough. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Fishing
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixThere was a moment of silence. The air was filled with naught but stillness until the moment I loosed a victorious roar.“Yes! I got a bite!”
“What!?”I glanced to the side as I gave my fishing rod a good tug and reeled in my catch, only to see Lefi making an expression of shock.“Well, Lefi, that’s fish number two,” I said with a snarky grin. “Iunno about you, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that I’ve already won this little match of ours.”
“Your pursuit of victory comes with excess haste, for the event has yet to conclude. Victory has not yet eluded me.” The dragon, who’d been grinding her teeth in frustration, humphed before continuing to speak in an indignant tone. “And I see no reason to perform such a menial task in the first place. It makes little sense not to simply dry the riverbed should you wish to consume a fish.”
“Lefi, please. Talk about no taste in leisure.” I rolled my eyes. “Look, this, this is way more fun. And before you even think about actually doing it, running the river dry is hella wasteful and destructive, so please don’t.”‘Cause coming from you, that seems a bit real, y’know?The banter Lefi and I were engaged in was only an aside to the activity that we were focused on: fishing. The two of us were both camped out in front of the river running through the dungeon’s grasslands, rods in hand and ready to extract our prey at a moment’s notice.We weren’t the only two fishing either. Lyuu was doing the same, though she didn’t quite seem all that focused. She kept glancing towards Illuna and Shii. Bored of fishing, the two had started playing around with Rir, hence why Lyuu was so distracted. As a warwolf, she couldn’t help but allow the Fenrir to draw her attention.Like Illuna and friends, Leila was also situated nearby. She was seated on a large picnic blanket, and continued to watch over the rest of us with a big smile on her face. Or at least that was what she was doing most of the time. She would occasionally seem to make a eureka face, pull out a stack of paper and start scribbling away while chuckling with all the wickedness of a mad scientist. It was something I had seen many times now. She’d started doing it ever since she put an abrupt end to that magic lesson the other day, and had basically never stopped. She didn’t seem to be able to focus on anything all that much either. The sheep-horned demon girl would always be mumbling something or another under her breath, even while doing the chores.That said, it wasn’t like I’d grown accustomed to her cackling. Honestly bro, that shit’s kinda freaky. I wasn’t the only one that found her recent actions intimidating either. Lyuu had evidently felt the same way, as she’d come to me for a consultation. Frankly, Leila’s demonic cackling had terrified her.Despite her newfound habits and lack of attention, however, Leila was still doing one hell of a job. Yeah, you know what? I’mma just leave that be. She’ll get back to normal eventually. I hope.I shook my head to stop myself from imagining the opposite case and once again returned to reflecting on the day. Today was, like the day we had the picnic, another outing for everyone to kick back and relax. And of course, the cause of it all was the discovery that the river contained fish.I myself had not been responsible for placing the fish where they were. I hadn’t known that they were there at all. In fact, I was surprised to see that the river I’d used DP to create was filled with life. All sorts of fish were swimming around in it like it was nobody’s business. The only conclusion I could come to was that the fish just happened to come with the river, and that was just how it was. Thinking along those lines, that probably means that there’s stuff living in the mountains I decided to place as a backdrop and whatnot too. But oh well whatever. They’re way too far out for me to really give a shit. And the fish are way more important right now.The fact that fish existed and were in a safe, accessible area meant that I straight up had no choice but to start fishing. And that was why I’d arranged this little get together. A fishing trip, per se. But despite it being the purpose of the outing, Lefi, Lyuu, and I were the only ones that were actually fishing.“…Woah! I think I just got one!” Lyuu shouted wide-eyed as she reeled her catch.
“Nrgghhh…” Again, Lefi groaned. “I see that you too have done as Yuki has, Lyuu.”
“Mhm! I guess that leaves you in last place, huh?” replied the warwolf.
“I shall see to it that the two of you face retribution for your conceit,” growled Lefi.The supreme dragon’s discontent stemmed from the fact that us three fishermen were engaged in a high stakes game with tonight’s dinner on the line. Literally. We were planning to have fish tonight, and whoever caught the least would be stuck with the shoddiest meal, or maybe even no meal at all depending on the catch. Of course, while numbers were the primary method of determining the winners and losers, one could redeem themselves and perhaps even claim victory through quality as well. The requirement for such a victory was to catch something large enough to function as tonight’s main dish.As I was lost in thought, Illuna, who’d been playing around, pitter-pattered over and gave Lefi’s back a big hug.“Hey Lefi! Have you caught anything really big yet?” she asked.
“I-I have not,” stuttered the dragon girl. “But it shan’t be long. I assure you that I will soon procure a catch of an impressive size.”
“Wow! I’m really excited to see what you’ll fish up, so do your best!” Illuna left as quickly as she came, and returned to playing with everyone else after voicing a few words of encouragement.I began to grin. I really couldn’t help it given what I’d just seen.“And why precisely have you that look on your face?” Lefi scowled.
“Naw, it’s nothing. I was just thinking that you two sure are close.”
“Fmph.” Lefi snorted as her cheeks turned red and her lips curled upwards in an expression of discontent. “I’ve little reason to consider Illuna anything less than a sister. It is only fair that I regard her with kindness.”
“I see, I see. A sister, huh?”
“What is it that you are trying to say?”
“Nah, don’t sweat it. It’s nothing.”I’m just happy you think of her that way. That’s all.“…Regardless, the expression you bear is one that stirs my rage. I shall see to it that you change it, even if I must do it mys—” Lefi was cut off mid-sentence as she suddenly felt something pull at her rod. “—A catch! It is time for me to lessen the gap between our scores!”
“That rod’s mad bending. You hook the riverbed again or something?”
“Say what you will, for soon, you shall weep! The creature I have caught is undoubtedly one of impressive size!”Lefi enthusiastically roared as she pulled on her rod. And as she did, her prey surfaced. Wait. The fuck is that thing!?The bizarre creature had a body that resembled a tree trunk, a beard made of writhing tentacles, and a mouth lined with dozens of tiny fangs. I had absolutely no idea what it was, but it creeped me out either way.“Hey uh… Lefi… You mind doing me a favour and fishing up something that’s a little less… bizarre? Like, seriously. I can’t even tell if that thing’s supposed to be a fish or something else altogether.”
“T-That is completely irrelevant. All that matters is that I too have now landed a catch!”
“I mean, yeah sure. But if you’re going to count that, then you better make sure you eat it when dinner comes around, alright?”
“…I shall leave that duty to Rir.”Please don’t feed my pet weird shit. Kthxbye.“Ahem!” Lefi cleared her throat. “As I was saying, I believe that this brings Lyuu and I to one catch apiece. While you are still yet ahead of us, the end is yet to be in sight. This contest of ours is not yet over!”The dragon smirked before turning to the beastkin beside her.“Listen well, Lyuu. We must burn away the very essence that composes us and steal away all that there is to capture. For tonight, we leave Yuki with only the smallest morsel!”
“Huh? Uh… sure! Master’s been kinda mean lately, so this is just the right thing I gotta do to teach ‘im a lesson!”
“Hah!” I scoffed. “All I hear from you guys are the cries of the incapable. I’ll show you noobs just how overwhelming a real fisherman can be!”And so, with our spirits lit aflame, the three of us continued to fish.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Been a while, hasn’t it? A lot of stuff has happened since the last chapter. I had my debut in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and created a new tier list in the process. Boss Young’un is applying to a bunch of companies, so wish him luck with that. Sebas finally banged Tuareninya (it’s about time if I do say so myself) [Note, this is from Overlord], and Speedphoenix went through about 3 reincarnations. Stubborn ol’ flamin’ bird just won’t stay dead. Uh, I mean… I cherish our friendship. Hehe… heh…. And as for our favorite dungeon crew, seems like Yuki raised a flag with his “Oh, stuff might live in the mountains too, but they’re too far away to worry about.” Ol’ boy’s gonna wake up to a Yeti in his face. Naturally, with Lefi there, ain’t much gonna be done by it, but it’d still be a real colon cleanser, wouldn’t it? All right, I see we got four letters in Joker’s Big Sack O’ Letters (trademark pending), so big thanks to kx, dicky satria, Zehd Cashew, and zekkendo for your wonderful questions. All right, I gotta head out now. Ganondorf’s getting real uppity, so Arsene and I need to knock him down a peg or two on the tier list. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Barbeque
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerMy surroundings were dim, lit only by three sources. The first was a magical lamp, which provided only the slightest bit of illumination. The second was the flame that kept the grill alight, whose warmth provided us with the ambience of a night out in the woods. Finally, there was the moon and the brilliant star-filled sky around it. I knew it was fake, a mere creation, but turning my eyes upon it gripped my heart with a sense of wonder regardless.“God damn it…” I groaned as I stoked the fire. “I really didn’t think I’d actually lose. Man, talk about a sudden comeback.”
“You lost quite easily for a man that dared to boast,” Lefi smirked. She was hanging around right beside me, and not for any good reason either. She was only there to gloat. “How delectable this is. I must say, Yuki, I am impressed by your skill as a chef. It is a shame that you are unable to taste the fruits of your efforts yourself. To think that you must miss out on such delicious meat.”Though she spoke words of pity, the shit eating grin she had plastered all over her face clearly indicated that her true feelings were quite a far cry from what she claimed. Further evidence came shortly as she used a pair of chopsticks, a tool she’d only recently mastered, to taunt me with a piece of meat. She brought the perfectly grilled morsel right before my eyes and just left it dangling.Nom.“What!? You ate it!?” shouted Lefi in a confused tone.
“Yeah. It was pretty good, if I do say so myself.”
“How dare you! Spit it out! Return it to me immediately! That piece was the last we had of its variety!”Lefi protested by lightly hitting my chest over and over, but I disregarded her and continued to chew, stopping only to gloat with a grin. “My bad. You basically left it right in front of my mouth, so I figured you were probably trying to feed me.”“I did no such thing! You swine! Fiend! Demon!”
“Mwahahahaha!” I cackled. “Indeed, Lefi. You speak to none other than a fiendish demon lord! How haven’t you noticed?”
“I have not fallen for your deception! I had known from the moment I first laid eyes on you that you were a fiend!” shouted Lefi.I put Lefi’s insults aside and instead began to reflect on the fishing contest. I had managed to remain in the lead for quite some time. I kept netting fish after fish, and neither of the other two could even come close. To that end, Lefi soon began protesting that the whole scenario was unfair given my experience. Cocky as I was, I agreed to give them a handicap. Thus, it ended up me vs. Team LL.Though they put both their efforts and catches together, I still held onto the lead regardless. But then, it happened. My reign came crashing down. Lefi managed to steal my crown away by landing a massive catch the moment before we called it a day.The massive creature yanked on her rod with all the force it could. If Lefi had been any other delicate-looking girl, she probably would’ve been dragged right into the river. But though she didn’t look it, she was the supreme dragon, and thus managed to easily tear the creature out of the water. The reason I referred to her catch as a creature was because, although it looked like a squid, it was apparently some sort of fish. Yeah, I still don’t get it. The fuck was up with that thing?It was obviously large enough to serve as the night’s main dish, and so, team LL claimed the victory. In other words, my loss was entirely my own fault. Lyuu would have been stuck at rock bottom had I not allowed the two of them to form a team.As per the conditions of the bet, the loser (read: me) was responsible for firing up the grill and barbecuing everything while everyone else ate; I wasn’t supposed to be allowed to eat until everyone was full.That said, neither Lefi nor Lyuu could actually cook, so I would’ve ended up sitting in front of the grill regardless of who won. The only difference was that Leila would have helped me out had I not come in last place. But since I did, she too had been granted the right to sit around and eat to her heart’s content while I did all the cooking myself. Fortunately, the fish had all been gutted ahead of time, so all I really had to do was sit in front of the grill and watch as it did its job. Yeah, no biggie.“Come on guys! Stop picking on each other already!” Illuna scolded Lefi and I as she approached. “And open wide Yuki!”
“Thanks, Illuna,” I said as I bit down on the piece of meat she presented me.
“Mmmmnnn, that’s tasty. Having you feed it to me made it taste a whole hundred times better.”
“Then I guess I gotta feed you lots more!” the young vampire giggled with delight as she handed me another slice of meat.That smile though. What an angel.“You must cease, Illuna. You are spoiling him rotten,” said Lefi. “It is his duty to atone for his loss.”
“But he’s the only one not eating and I feel really bad for him! Good food should be shared with everyone! Right, Shii?”
“Right!”The two girls exchanged glances while happily chewing on their food. C u t e.“You see that, Lefi? That’s called kindness,” I said in a matter of fact tone. “You should really take a page out of her book.”
“…I cannot disagree. Very well.” Lefi grabbed some vegetables and brought them to my face.
“Huh? U-Uhh. alright. Well, I guess that means you get it, so don’t mind if I do.”Failing to see any reason to reject her offer, I ate what Lefi had presented me.“And here is another serving.”
“T-Thanks.”
“And another.”
“Thanks Lef—WAIT A SECOND! WHY ARE YOU ONLY FEEDING ME VEGETABLES!?”The dragon girl responded to me with a despondent shrug. “I see that you do not appreciate my attempts to feed you. How petty, to meet my kindness with naught but complaints.”“Yeah, how about you at least feed me some meat before you start mouthing off like that.”
“The meat does appear rather delectable,” said Lefi. “I suppose I will have some.”Lefi went out of her way by grabbing the exact piece I’d pointed to before swallowing it whole. Damn it Lefi. I swear to god…“Uhmmmm…” Leila said between hesitant but elegant bites out of a grilled fish. “I would not mind taking over if you so wish it, My Lord.”Speaking of fish, the bizarre life form that served as Lefi’s first catch had been released back into the river, as none of us had been all that keen on eating it. Yeaaaah, shit looked gross as fuck.“That’s a no can do Leila. S’his job since he lost ‘n all that,” said Lyuu.
“Says the person that barely caught jack.”
“That don’t matter, master. A win is a win,” The warwolf grinned.She was right, so the only response I could offer was a frustrated groan.“Ay Rir, mah dude. You know that Lyuu chick? Bitch be mean as hell.” I intentionally spoke in a hoodlum-like manner while doing absolutely nothing to lower my voice. [1]
“Wha- hey! Sayin’ that to Rir’s just a real act o’ good ol’ cowardice, Master! F-Fine, I getcha. H-Here, I’ll feed ya some meat.”
“Nah, I’m good. I lost. This is my duty as the loser”
“W-What the heck Master!? L-Lord Rir! You got it all wrong, this ain’t my fault! I-I ain’t mean at all!”The wolf slumped over and whined, almost as if to indicate that he wanted to be left out of the argument.“Watch yourself, Yuki, for your hands appear rather idle for one responsible for the fire.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I won’t slack. Oh yeah, before I forget. Stop feeding me all the god damn vegetables and have some yourself.”
“U-Urk…” The dragon groaned. “I have had the inclination to ask this of you for quite some time now. Why is it that I must eat mere grass? I see not the reason, and I have never once in all my years felt the need to do so.”
“First of all, vegetables aren’t just grass,” I said. “And while it’s true that you can get by without them, eating them is much better for you than not. You’ve gotta keep a balanced diet if you want to stay healthy, you know?”Of course, I understood that Lefi, being a “Supreme Dragon,” may not be built the same way as any other omnivore, but I felt that she needed to be fed vegetables nonetheless, just not for nutrition. She needs to be a lot less of a picky eater, and I know for a fact that she won’t back down if I start spoiling her now.“I believe you mentioned that you are starved for meat…?” The dragon grabbed a piece of the stuff I’d been pointing at earlier and parked it right in front of me.
“Yeah, thanks.” I ate it, chewed, and swallowed before continuing. “But don’t think you can get out of eating your veggies just ‘cause you actually started feeding me meat.”
“…”Lefi please. I saw that one coming from a mile away.***TL Note[1] He actually speaks in the Jojo style here, where some of the syllables are dragged out and the sentences are intentionally short and choppy. The official Jojo localizations don’t seem to have done anything special when characters suddenly begin speaking in the aforementioned manner, so I’m not really sure what I should be doing for the reference in this case.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Huh. Well, shit. I wasn’t expecting this chapter to come out so early. I didn’t have time to get my joke cards written up for this session.

The State of Affairs
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Hey Nell. Long time no see.”I called out to the approaching silhouette with a casual wave as I watched it approach through the forest. The map had told me that she was coming, so I left the castle in order to meet her at the entrance to my dungeon.“How the heck did you know that I was h… you know what, I’m not even going to ask.” Nell blinked a few times, taken aback by the fact that I’d already been waiting for her. “Man, I know this forest is huge and all, but I can’t believe seeing you actually made me feel relieved. That actually makes me kind of mad,” she huffed.Yeah, and that’s my fault, how…?Unable to come up with a response, I instead shifted the topic. “It’s a shame you didn’t show up three days ago. You missed out on some real good barbecue.”“I don’t really mind,” she said. “It’s just a barbecue.”
“Seriously. It was real good,” I said. “Anyway, I bet you’re tired. You want to hit up the hot springs first?”
“I’d really like to, but maybe next time,” said Nell, her tone grim. “I’m on a bit of a tight schedule right now.”
“Fair enough. Well, either way, come in and make yourself at home.”I turned around and led Nell into the cave. A wave of nice cool air hit us right as we entered, and our footsteps gradually echoed behind us as we got deeper and deeper.Only after a few minutes of walking did we finally arrive at a thick, heavy door, one that came with a sense of grandeur. Although the door seemed to give off an almost ominous aura, I opened it as casually as I would any other.On the other side lay the usual grassy plain. Specifically, we were behind the castle and right beside the good old hot-spring endowed, Japanese-style inn or ryokan, depending on where you hailed from.“Huh…?” Nell blinked a few times. “Wasn’t that door supposed to take us in front of the castle?”
“It was, but it wasn’t all that convenient, so I had it swapped.” There were a series of rattling noises as I opened a second door, the sliding door that marked the ryokan’s entrance. “Oh yeah, shoes off.”
“Huh? I uhmm… Okay.”The hero was unable to accept the explanation I gave her at face value, so she more or less nodded along as she followed me into a room she was more familiar with.I grabbed a pair of cushions off the stack sitting in the corner of the room and placed them on the opposite sides of a table. I sat down on mine, crossed my legs, and waited until she timidly followed suit before I started talking.“Alright, why don’t you tell me what happened?”***“So to summarise,” said the hero. “It was apparently all just to buy time. The hoodlums with the magic weapon, the various cases happening around the city, and the undead assault were all just a part of a scheme meant to keep Governor Lurubia focused on his own territory. And it kind of worked. They managed to get the governor to keep the vast majority of its troops in Alfyro. But because you showed up and cleaned everything up, the governor managed to send a horse to the capital and report what had happened.”She took a deep breath before continuing.“Thanks to that, we were able to learn a bit more about the incident that happened in the capital itself.”
“Mhmm…” I made a noise to indicate I was still listening as I sipped from a cup of hot tea, one Leila had dropped by to serve.Nell was here in order to provide an account of what she and the old man had learned about the case. In other words, she had come to fulfill the promise she made when I handed over the totally not suspicious looking necromancer I had caught back in town. The reason I’d been waiting for her was, again, because my map had told me that there was an intruder inbound. I had more or less already figured out her intentions the moment I realized it was her.Long story short, the country that the old man served had happened to undergo a change in leadership. A coup.And it had apparently all started because Prince Retard had found himself at his wit’s end. He had made far too many major mistakes in too short a timespan. And so, he did what any other dumb shit in his position would do and more or less led an armed uprising.The reason he had found himself so cornered was twofold. The first was because he had lost the expedition force despite using greed to win his father’s subjects over. His promises of gold and glory turned up as nothing but hot air and dead soldiers. The second was a failure in a similar vein. He had abused his authority in order to force the church to deploy the ever valuable hero without consulting the relevant authorities (read: his father).And, like the army, she too had vanished into thin air. Of course, Nell was fine. She had been with us the whole time, in fact. However, the church had declared her MIA. A part of it had been because the hero hadn’t made any reports. But, as she discovered upon her return, that wasn’t the only reason. The church had used her supposed death as an excuse to put more pressure on Prince Dumbfuck. Goddamn. This world be fucking scary.But whatever the case, the end result was the same. Shit had hit the fan. Hard.The prince’s reputation hit rock bottom. And, to him, it probably seemed like his brilliant future had slipped right outside his grasp before his very eyes.He only had two choices remaining. The first was to put everything he had at stake all while trusting that he could somehow miraculously turn everything around. The second was to take everyone else down with him. And so, Prince Fuckwad did what any self-respecting, reasonable human being would. He went with choice number one; he chose to engage in a desperate sink or swim struggle that could allow him to either reclaim his “all that was his by right” or lose it forever.Hence why he had attacked the city. Apparently, his territory’s proximity to the Wicked Forest resulted in the old dude’s forces, the soldiers and adventurers that inhabited his city, to be much stronger than the norm. Moreover, he was both loyal to the king and against the prince’s expedition plan to begin with. Thus, the prince had subjected him to an attack in order to direct his attention away from the capital while he seized control of the throne.Apparently, he had done similar things elsewhere. He ordered attacks on all the other cities lorded over by governors that did not agree with his policies, paralyzing them and rendering them unable to interfere. But again, because the old man’s troops were of such a high quality, he had been hit much harder than anyone else.And frankly, the prince’s ploy succeeded. The king had been declared missing, and the capital was now under the control of a force that he had charge of. Wow, shit for brains over there actually thought up something decent for once. The king being missing is some real nasty shit.If the king was alive, then one could expect his supporters to rally his troops in order to rescue him. And if he was dead, then one could expect his supporters to march on the capital flying banners of justified vengeance. But since he was missing and not known to be in either of the aforementioned states, his supporters were paralyzed. There was no cause for them to rally under. And they couldn’t act without extreme caution.The plan was effective, but it would only ever be able to buy so much time. Those that opposed Prince Dickwad would soon find an excuse to rally, but they would not be able to touch him so long as he put together a functional administration prior to their arrival.There were many that didn’t want the prince on the throne.And I was among them.The prince had already prodded at me twice. I had no doubt that he would send an even larger force right to my doorstep should he gain full control over the country’s military. I doubted that I would be able to handle the entire thing myself.There was a chance I would have to ask Lefi to lend me a hand. Yeah no. Fuck that.You’d think this idiot would learn his lesson after having his plans to move on me bite him in the ass twice in a row, so he probably won’t come again, but I’m just going to go ahead and assume the worst. Not thinking about something isn’t going to stop him from actually doing that something. God damn it. There go my days of kicking back with my feet on the sofa.Though I mentioned having to think up something, the truth was that I already had a little something up my sleeve. Y’know. Just going to give him a bit of irreversible brain damage and casually turn him into a comatose potato for the rest of his life. Nothing too special.I had already identified the exact tool that I would need to do it, a golem called the puppet of possession. As implied by its name, it was an inanimate creature that was capable of allowing my consciousness to possess it. It was the perfect assassin. I could use it to eliminate the prince from a safe distance. Or at least a relatively safe distance.The puppet would only function so long as it remained within a hundred meters of me so I couldn’t go too far. Still, it was useful. Like other golems, I could use additional DP in order to provide it with a specific set of skills. Heh. Oh, the possibilities.In truth, it would be much faster for me to descend upon the castle and remove the prince myself, but that didn’t quite seem like as good an idea as it seemed. The castle was home to the royal family and was, as one would expect, situated within the capital. It was obviously fortified with all sorts of defences. And as I wasn’t exactly all that keen on tying a metaphorical noose around my own neck, I figured it would be a much better idea to send something else in my stead.Unlike me, the golem was disposable. The only thing I’d lose from its death was a bit of DP. Farming up said DP was, in fact, one of the two reasons that Rir and I had been going hunting so often lately, with the other being the need to grow more accustomed to Zaien.“So what does the church think of the prince?”
“We’ve got our fair share of misgivings about him coming into power,” said Nell. “He’s the stubborn type, so he’ll most likely put a lot of pressure on the church and try to force it to bend to his will.”
“I see.. So are you guys planning to do anything about him then?”
“We’re planning to rescue the king.”
“Even though he’s missing?”
“Yeah. I think we’re going to go through with it either way.”I see. So the church is taking a bit of a firmer stance. Hmm, actually that’d probably work out in my favour if it went well.“Sounds good. How about I lend you guys a bit of a hand?”
“Huh…!? Well uhm, I’d really appreciate it since you’re real strong and it’d be reassuring to have you but…” Nell gave me a dubious, probing look, as if to ask me why I would bother.
“The prince has been a real thorn in my side, so I’m not exactly liking the prospect of having him in total control. Chances are, he’ll probably shove his entire army right onto my doorstep,” I said. “So I’d much rather have the guy who was king before get back onto the throne. Doesn’t really matter if he turns out dead either, so long as the faction that opposes the prince gets back in power, seeing as how most of them were against invading the Wicked Forest and all that.”While I didn’t lie to Nell, I hadn’t told her everything on my mind either.There was a chance that they would use some sort of weird method I didn’t know about in order to track me down if I assassinated the prince. And if that happened, the whole country would likely be out for my blood even if the old king was reinstated. Going after the fiend that murdered a member of the royal family was only natural, especially given the fact that it was the god damned prince.And if that happened, there was a chance I’d end up with a huge army on my doorstep either way. I wouldn’t be able to continue living in peace. Hence, working with the anti-prince faction was a much better choice, as the faction as a whole would take my place as the culprit responsible for his demise.“Uhm… I don’t think anyone will trust you since you’re a demon lord. I know you’re a weirdo, but everyone else will probably assume you’re just like all the others,” said Nell. God damn, woman. Talk about throwing shade.
“No worries. I wasn’t planning on exposing my identity. Just tell them that I’m someone you happened to meet along the road and that I decided to serve you or something. I’ll even wear a mask, just in case.”
“I’m pretty sure that won’t work. We do have magical tools that appraise people, so…”
“Oh come on, don’t worry. It’s fine. I’ve got something in mind that’ll keep everything right under control. Trust me.”The hero put on an expression of unease, to which I responded with nothing but a playful grin.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Boy, talk about a shift in power. Looks like Prince Deadasfuck hasn’t learned his lesson, so Yuki needs to go over there and show him Daddy’s belt. Seems like Nell is just a tool to get there too. Wonder what she’ll do when she finds out. Should be fun to see, aye? All right, let’s take a look at the letter bag. *he reaches into the bag, feels around for a while, then pauses and puts his whole head into it. After a few seconds, he turns it over and shakes it. Bits of dust and lint fall out as he looks crestfallen* Oh. I see… No letters this time. Oh well. I guess I can go though and thank the ones from chapter 84 that I didn’t get to since Boss Young’un gave us 85 so fast. So thanks Zehd Cashew and zrxr for your questions. Remember, if you’ve got a question you’d like answered by me, leave it in the comments below and I’ll reply. Get noticed by your senpai today! All right, everyone. See y’all in the next chapter! *he goes to pick up the sack, but notices a weight in it. Excited, he turns it over and shakes it, only for the Demon Lord of all moths to come flying out and straight at him, the wingspan larger than his head. He lets out a high pitched shriek and runs off*<– Prev — Next –>

A Journey to the Capital
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“Alright, I think that’s just about everything. I’ll see you guys soon,” I said to the dungeon’s residents. All five of its more humanoid members were lined up right in front of the cave outside. “I should be back in less than a week this time.”The reason they’d assembled so early in the morning was to see the hero and I off; a full night had passed since her arrival, so she was nice and rested.“Stay safe!” said one little girl. “And come back soon, okay?”
“Really really soon!” chirped the other.
“You can count on it.” I gave each a pat on the head and a smile.
“Yuki.” The next person to step forward was Lefi.
“What’s u—mrrmphhrhh!?”I turned towards her, only to have my cheeks suddenly pinched and ruthlessly stretched to their limits before I could so much as finish a sentence.“Listen well, Yuki. I shan’t be there to keep an eye on you this time. That means not that you should find yourself enamoured by some human woman and dally in your return. You must come straight home once you have completed the task that you set out to accomplish. Have I made myself clear?”She used the grip she had on my poor cheeks to keep me looking straight at her as she spoke. And as such, I couldn’t help but notice the fact that she was smiling in an awfully intimidating manner.“Fweah, aye gnowe.”Only after I agreed did Lefi let go of my cheeks.“Splendid. I am glad that we were able to ascertain that we have come to an understanding.”
“Thanks Lefi,” I said. “I guess I’ll take you up on that offer then. I leave my home, my heart, and everyone’s safety in your capable hands.”
“Rest assured. I shall see to it that all is well.”
“Yeah. I know. I won’t even be the slightest bit worried with you around.”And so, I finished up my conversation with Lefi, exchanged a few words with the maids, and turned around to face the hero.“I do apologize, my lady, but we must make haste,” I said. “I have prepared the perfect carriage for such an occasion. Right this way, my lady.”
“Why did you suddenly start talking like some sort of butler? And, by carriage, did you mean that huge wolf?”
“Verily, my lady.” I completely ignored her first question and answered only the second.I hopped on top of Fluffrir before giving him a few light pats on the back. “Sorry Rir. I know it’s a bit far, but I’m going to need you to take us all the way to the capital.”We didn’t have the time to just sit around given the kingdom’s… circumstances. And the wolf was more or less the best vehicle a man could ask for. Hell, Rir’s so fast that he may as well be a Super Express Bullet Train.Fortunately, Lefi was staying home this time, so Rir didn’t need to hang around and keep watch. We actually had the opportunity to board him and ride him all the way to the capital.The ever-reliable wolf nodded to acknowledge the command and braced himself for departure. I once again turned towards the hero, who had completely frozen over while gazing in the wolf’s direction, and beckoned her over. “Well? What are you waiting for? Hurry up and get on.”“I-I think I’ll just wwaaaaaaaah!?”I grabbed the hesitant hero’s arm with a grin and wrenched her onto the wolf before she could refuse.“Alright Rir, all passengers have boarded. Full speed ahead!”
“Huh? Wait! Hold oooooooooooooooooooooooon!”The hero squealed in an unexpectedly adorable manner as she was exposed to a sudden burst of speed. Her screams almost seemed to trail behind us as we quickly made our way through the forest.***A massive rampart lay in front of me, extending as far as the eye could see. A great number of soldiers were pacing around atop of it, moving back and forth at regular intervals. They remained vigilant, and would occasionally stop to look around despite the fact that their surroundings were illuminated almost entirely by moonlight and moonlight alone. The outside wasn’t the only thing they surveyed. The troops would often direct their gazes into the city that the giant stone wall had been constructed to protect.The sole entrance to the stone fortress was a single, solid looking gate. The metal it was constructed of looked so thick that it wouldn’t let even a soul slip through. Like the rampart, the gate was heavily guarded; a group of stern-looking men stood in front of it.A grand total of two pairs of eyes was focused on the fortress. They observed it from within a forest that lay a bit further away.“Ugh… my back is totally killing me.” The owner of the first pair, the hero, voiced a complaint as she rubbed the backside of her waist.
“Yeah, well it was either this or we take at least three entire days to get here,” I said with a shrug.Rir had pretty much made a beeline from the dungeon to the capital, taking only a few breaks along the way. And as a result, we’d arrived in Alshir, the capital city, the exact same day we left. Normally, travelling such a distance in less than a day was flat out impossible. But Rir belonged to a species of which legends were sung. He was far outside the realm of what one could consider normal.One could say that the load on his back had been substantial. He had carried both me and the hero simultaneously. By all means, we should have slowed him down. The extra weight should have forced him to move at a pace far inferior to his best. And it would have, had we been a pair of fully armoured knights. But alas, that wasn’t the case. My magical inventory allowed me to carry nothing more than the clothes on my back. And the hero barely weighed anything at all; she was a dainty little thing; I could lift her with one arm with ease. And although she herself was technically a knight, she wasn’t the type that wore heavy metal plates to fortify her defences. As such, Rir was able to maintain a pace that matched that of your standard sedan.To him, covering the distance between our home and the capital had been a breeze. It hadn’t even begun to eat into the Fenrir’s near unlimited stamina.“I guess…” responded the hero. She still didn’t seem all that sold on the Rir Express. “Wait. How come you seem like you’re totally fine?”
“Oh, you know,” I shrugged. “I’m already used to it. In fact, I ride Rir around pretty much all the time.”And ‘cause I’m hooked on thrills and whatnot.Speaking of Rir, the wolf was no longer anywhere in sight. As much as I would’ve liked to, I knew that there was no way for us to get him into the city without causing a fuss. And as such, I’d told him to shrink down, hide somewhere in the forest, and await further orders.“So uh, any idea how we’re supposed to get inside?” I turned towards the hero and used a thumb to point to the wall at my back.We obviously couldn’t just waltz right up to the gate and say hello. While one would normally expect to be shown a fair amount of hospitality for such an approach, the current circumstances made it far more likely for such an action to be met with the sharp end of a spear.“Hmm… Dunno…” The hero frowned.
“…You were planning to return to the capital after paying me a visit, weren’t you? Shouldn’t you, y’know, know how you’re supposed to get back in?”I narrowed my eyes and gave the girl an unamused stare, to which she responded by spouting off a series of excuses.“I was! And I totally knew what I was supposed to do, but I really wasn’t expecting it to be this well guarded! Look over there.” She pointed towards what looked to be the entrance to a sort of sewage system attached to a part of the wall. It was fairly well hidden, obscured by a series of tall trees. The sewer seemed to have a freshly installed iron grate covering the exit. Moreover, there were several guards positioned around it. “I was supposed to use an item to make myself invisible and then sneak back through there so I could rendezvous with the church’s knights, but it doesn’t really look like we can get through anymore…”Oh. So they found out about the security hole she was going to use and patched it. Makes sense.“Alright, just making sure. You do have plans for what you’re supposed to do after you get back inside, right?”
“I-I think so.”
“Alright, then I guess we’re getting over the wall my way,” I said. “Excuse me for a moment.”I grabbed her and tucked her under one of my arms as I spoke.“Huh!? Wait! H-Hold on!”
“Oh shut it already.”I heaved an exasperated sigh as I activated Stealth. Stealth was, fortunately, able to extend its effects to anything I touched. That aspect of its effect was what stopped my clothes from walking around by themselves. Without it, I probably wouldn’t be able to find anything to do with the skill besides maybe a few niche little things like freaking people out. Walking clothes does seem like something out of some sort of horror movie, after all.“I said be quiet dammit. They’ll notice us if you keep up all the noise.”I materialized both pairs of wings after confirming that the stealth skill had activated before giving them a good old flap and diving into the starry night sky. The ground almost seemed to shrink in an instant as we rose. And soon, we began to see much more of our surroundings than we had before.The hero’s response to the sudden change was to scream in terror.“God damn it Nell! I told you to keep quiet!”
“I-I know, but it’s not like I could help it!”The guards began shuffling around and making a big fuss the moment the hero’s cry filled the night.“I think I just heard something!” said one.
“It came from somewhere up above us! Someone get some lights up in the sky!” added another.
“See? What’d I tell you?” Although they were aware that something was there, they hadn’t actually seen us, so I decided there wasn’t any harm in continuing as planned.And so, I succeeded in infiltrating the kingdom’s capital with a certain terrified hero held under my arm all the way.***Editor’s note (Joker): *when the lights come up, it’s not Joker sitting in his usual chair. Instead, a catgirl with short blue hair is sitting there* U-um.. Joker onii-chan is still running away from that scary moth, so I’m going to be hosting this… um… session… thing. Onii-chan calls me Nirvash. It’s a pleasure to meet all of you. *she bows her head politely* Um… I don’t really know what onii-chan talks about here, but I know he checks his mail bag for letters. *she ducks under the table, murmuring “Nisho, nisho nisho” as she digs around, coming out with the letter bag* Um… it looks like there are five letters in here. So thank you kx onii-chan, Tup onii-chan, Zehd Cashew onii-chan, Yarsh Naidoo onii-chan, and spare onii-chan. *she bows her head and smiles brightly* Um… hopefully Joker onii-chan gets away from that scary moth and will be able to talk to you all again. I miss him, and I hope you all do to. If you have a question you want to ask him, put it in the comments with the hashtag #AskJoker, or if you want to ask me a question….I don’t know if anyone would…. You can put #AskNirvash and I’ll answer. *she smiles again* Thank you for reading!<– Prev — Next –>

A Girls Only Slumber Party
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixWhile Yuki’s infiltration of the capital was indeed an event of note, it was not the only that had happened that night. In fact, a certain group of women had organized a little get-together, the climax of which occurred at about the same time a certain Demon Lord had made it over the wall.Lefi, Lyuu, and Leila sat facing each other atop a series of futons. The three had taken the fact that Yuki was out of the house as an opportunity to discuss topics the likes of which they wouldn’t dare mention in his presence. It was a so-called girl’s night out, save for the fact that they’d stayed in as opposed to going out. Of course, the event hadn’t just spanned the later parts of the evening, and the three present weren’t the only attendees. Shii and Illuna had both participated in its earlier phases, only to fall asleep as their bedtime came around. The former had reverted to her slime form and situated herself atop her cushion, while the latter had passed out with her head resting in Lefi’s lap.“Oh yeah Lefi, that reminds me!” Lyuu turned to the dragon girl in order to address her with a question. “Y’know what that weird relaxing aura Master’s got around him is? I dunno why, but being ‘round him pretty much always just makes me feel all calm and safe ‘n stuff.”
“It is an effect of the mana radiating from his being.”
“The mana?” Although Lefi had answered Lyuu’s question, Leila had spoken up before the warwolf could reply. The topic had piqued her interest.
“All livings things leak the magical energy that they contain. Individuals possess subtle differences that allow others to discern them,” said Lefi.
“…I see.” Leila paused for a moment before nodding to acknowledge the silver-haired girl’s claim. “That would explain why I felt as if each individual seemed to possess some sort of aura. It does make sense for that to be something based in mana.”
“Precisely. The mana is reflective of the individual. It can be used to discern whether one is a beastkin, a demon, or a dragon and tells much about its source. That it is why Yuki’s presence brings you peace of mind. It is none other than his calming aura that draws others to him. It is why Illuna grew so attached to him on such short notice,” said Lefi. She used her fingers to comb through the hair of the vampire that adored her like a sister as she spoke. “And it is one of the reasons the hero chose to loosen her guard and engage him in conversation, with the other being his lack of ill intent. I suppose that one could claim this a talent, of sorts.”
“Whaddya mean?”
“He is a natural womanizer, a philanderer capable of easily deceiving a woman should he ever feel the need,” scoffed Lefi. “I would not be surprised to find that he has performed such an act in the past.”The way the dragon girl ended off with a snort caused Lyuu to force a bit of a wry smile.“Right, so master being a philanderer ‘n stuff leads me right to somethin’ I’ve been meanin’ to ask ya for a good while. I’ve been real curious, and it’s been killin’ me.”
“What is it?”
“It’s that ring there.” Lyuu pointed to the accessory Lefi was wearing around her fourth finger. “Is that what I think it is?”
“Uhm… er… indeed,” confirmed the dragon after a good bit of stammering. “It is a gift I received from none other than Yuki himself.”
“Oh my god!” Lyuu squealed in excitement. That said, she made sure to do so at a relatively low volume as to not wake those that were already asleep.
“Wow,” added Leila. “I did not think that My Lord had it in him. I’m impressed.”
“Wait, wait! Does that mean he already p-proposed to you!?” Despite being the one to suggest the idea, Lyuu started to blush and stammer at the mention of wedlock. “When the heck did you guys get that far along anyways!? I could’ve sworn you weren’t all the way there just yet!”Neither of the maids had heard the pair profess the full extent of their feelings for one another, but they’d always been convinced that something was going on. Anyone with working eyes could have immediately identified that they were at least on friendly terms; the way they both fought and played made it obvious that, at the very least, mutual dislike was off the menu.The sight of the ring on Lefi’s finger had caused Lyuu to speculate that something had happened while the two were away, that some event had gotten them to suddenly further their relationship while the dungeon’s residents remained none the wiser.“I-It was not.” The dragon only barely managed to squeeze out a reply in all of her embarrassment. “It was no more than a present.”
“Not yet, huh?” Lyuu heaved an unamused sigh. “But well, getting something like that means you’re probably just shy of having him in the bag, right?”
“…I am not sure.”The dragon girl’s uncertainty only seemed to spark Lyuu’s curiosity all the more; she immediately threw yet another question Lefi’s way.“Wait, so how do y’feel about Master anyway? I mean, I can see you guys are at least on good terms, but…”The question flew as straight as a bullet. And while one would normally expect a maiden like Lefi to redden up and act all embarrassed as a result, she did not. Instead, she simply pursed her lips in silence. Only after she found the right words to say did she finally open her mouth and slowly give form to her thoughts.“If I am to remain completely honest, I know not.” Each of her words was slow, deliberate, and carefully chosen.
“You don’t?” Leila raised an eyebrow.
“I know not how I feel. Not about him. Nor about you.” Lefi paused for a moment before continuing. “I have been by my lonesome for a long, long time. The only others that I have ever met either cowered before my power or sought to challenge me and evaluate their own prowess. I was never regarded in an amicable manner. He was the first to treat me not as an object of terror, nor a foe to surmount, but as Leficios, the individual.”The two maids remained silent as they listened to the dragon’s tale.“I never once would have even entertained the idea of living among others had he not interacted with me in such a manner. Never once had I ever imagined that my life would take such a turn, that I would have him, the two of you, and Illuna by my side,” said Lefi. “The emotions that he has brought me are those the likes of which I have never felt. And as such, I have not the understanding of what I am to think of them.”Lefi averted her gaze and blushed as she revealed her thoughts to the maids. Both of them understood that, while one could not see it from her appearance alone, Lefi had spent a great number of years with solitude as her only companion. A great loneliness plagued her, one the likes of which no other could imagine. And it had etched itself into her heart with time.“…So does being with Master make everything all fun now?”
“Undoubtedly,” said Lefi. “This nest of his is filled with many an interesting thing. Oddities stretch as far as the eye can see. And its owner is the strangest thing of all.”Her interpretation of the man they knew as their master caused both maids to giggle.“I am inclined to agree,” said Leila. “I have only rarely seen any other that even vaguely resembles My Lord.”
“Right? Master sure is an interesting one,” added Lyuu. “But seein’ this side of you is real fresh, Lefi. You’re a lot more relatable than I thought at first. I feel like I know you a lot better now and that we’ve gotten lots closer.”
“I feel the same,” said Lefi with a smile. “Never before have I thought of myself as just another woman. Now, I feel very much inclined to do so.”
“So how did ya meet Master anyway, Lefi?”
“An interesting tale, that is,” said the dragon. “I supposed that it is only just that I weave a story about my first encounter with the mysterious substance we know as chocolate.”And so, the three girls continued their discussion deep into the night.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Sorry about last chapter, but when you get bum rushed by a moth bigger than your head, it tends to leave plenty of mental scars. Also, due to the amount of… criticism I guess?… that I got for having Nirvash take my place, I’ll keep running the show regardless of any mental issues that I might get from it. *beaming smile* That said, she’s very grateful for the questions people asked her, but I’d ask you guys to please not ask her anything… unnecessary, if you get my (Tokyo) drift. That said, as I reach into my sack here… *before he does, he beats it long and hard with a broom, jumping up and down on it, rolling over it, and generally doing everything he can to flatten it out* Ah, there we go. No moth surprises here. Let’s see, thanks to sakana-kun[CS-chan mk.vi], Sup, and kx (and there’s nothing under my bed, so QUIT LOOKING). Remember, all, if you’ve got a question for me, just leave it in the comments below with the hashtag #AskJoker, and I’ll respond to ya. Get noticed by your senpai today! Kek. All right, I’ll end it here. My therapy session is in a couple minutes, so I gotta get to it. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Illegal Entry
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“What the heck Yuki!” shouted Nell. “Would it kill you to be just a bit more considerate!?”
“Yeah, yeah, enough of that. Come on, I said sorry already, didn’t I? Plus, I did warn you before I lifted off.”
“Warn me? Warn me!? All you did was tell me to be quiet if I didn’t want the guards to notice us! How the heck was I supposed to know that you were going to just suddenly take off!?”Fine. I admit it, your honour, I’m guilty. Spooking the poor girl had been a part of an overarching fiendish plot all along.“Right, so I’d love to keep talking about how innocent I am, but it looks like we’ve got a few guards headed our way.” Although I had admitted to my guilt internally, I had no intention of letting the hero catch on. “How about we put this whole being nicer to you thing on hold for a bit and come back to it later?”The hero had leaned in while scolding me to express her anger. In fact, she had leaned so far in that her face was uncomfortably close despite the fact that I had started bending myself backwards.I mentioned something she was likely to pay attention to while pointing at the area behind her in order to get her off me. Of course, while it was a convenient excuse, it wasn’t actually a lie by any means. I could hear the rustling of armour as it rapidly closed in on our location; it was obvious that the soldiers in charge of security had overheard us. My ears were only one of the two sources of information I had on hand. The other, my map, was much more reliable. It had filled itself in when I looked down upon the city from above, and now it was telling me that we had a number of hostiles incoming.Speaking of my map, it was now capable of much more than it was when I first obtained it; I had long activated the function that allowed it to display any and all enemy signatures, even those outside the dungeon’s territory. Its sole limitation was that it only functioned if the area in question was one I had filled in already.Only recently had I discovered how the map worked. It apparently functioned by sending out signals that would run into magical particles in the air to obtain data on the terrain and any potential threats. In other words, it worked much in the same manner as the echolocation dolphins use. The sonars one would find on modern Japanese fishing boats and warships also made for a good comparison.The reason I needed to use DP to activate the ability was because doing so actually led to alterations within my body. Purchasing the feature had changed the way I interacted with magical particles. Wait a second, that totally makes me something along the lines of an artificially modified human, not that I’m human, but y’know, whatever. Either way, I’m basically a Sho*cker Combatman. Maybe I should start doing that whole “Yee” thing. [1]“Tsk,” Nell clicked her tongue in annoyance. “Fine. This way, Yuki, follow me.”God damn Nell. Stop with the tongue-clicking. Talk about unladylike.Fortunately, my excuse had worked, and Nell had finally gotten off my back, so I placed a hand on my chest, heaved a sigh of relief, and set out after her.***The pitter-pattering sound our feet made as they moved across the stone-paved street almost seemed to disappear as they reached the buildings that lined it. They just vanished.And it wasn’t because our steps blended in with the noise of the citizens enjoying their night lives. For that sound was nowhere to be heard. The streets were empty, devoid of noise. Our footsteps almost seemed to be sucked into a soundless void.“Man, it sure is quiet.” I couldn’t help but voice an opinion of our surroundings as I made note of them. It wasn’t late enough into the night for the streets to be as empty as they were. There should have, by all means, been people wandering about and slowly making their way home from taverns and the like. Yet, it was deathly silent. The whole atmosphere the place gave off was dull and lacking in life. Man, this place is way bigger than… Alfyro…? Or whatever the place Lefi and I visited was called, but god damn is it empty. The lack of people is making it seem all desolate and shit.“It used to be really lively around here, even at this time of day,” said Nell. “But everyone’s probably holed themselves in at home because of how dangerous it’s been to stay outside lately.”
“Yeah, sounds about right. I wouldn’t be surprised if the guards started cutting down everyone they saw out this late.”I had only been in the city for a matter of moments, so I naturally hadn’t seen it happen and there was a chance that it never had or would happen, and that my mind was simply stuck in a rut because of all its biases. But I felt as if the guards had most likely already murdered citizens in cold blood on false, completely bullshit charges just because they saw them wandering the streets at night.As a history major, I just knew that such an act was normal in the case that a city came under the jurisdiction of an armed force intent on overthrowing some sort of ruler.“I heard about how bad everything was already, but seeing it for myself really makes it hit home,” said the hero. “Wait, what’s that you’re wearing, Yuki? And when the heck did you even put it on?”
“What, this?” I smirked as I pointed to the mask I had stuck to my face. “It’s nothing special. I just, y’know, figured it’d be a good idea not to show my face to the church’s agents. I’m kinda a demon lord, so I’m thinking the church is probably one of my natural enemies or something like that.”The mask was awesome. It had slits for eyes, with a decoration under each. The left eye rested atop a star, and the right a teardrop. The mask’s mouth was twisted into a wide, happy grin. And though it seemed to resemble a clown more so than anything else, it gave off a sinister aura nonetheless. [2]I had actually acquired the mask quite a while ago. I’d spent a good bit of time browsing the catalogue for disguises, and this just happened to be the item that caught my eye. It was so badass that I couldn’t help but grab it and stash it into my storage the moment I saw it. It was a bit hard to see things in front of me while I wore it, but it couldn’t be helped. I needed a disguise, after all. Okay fine, yes, I’ll admit that’s bullshit. I’m just wearing it because of how fucking cool it is. It’s not like I’m wrong though. They won’t remember your face if all they see is your badass mask. God damn, that was so smart I should use one of my fingers to give myself a tap on the head.“I’m not really sure if there’s any real point in wearing a mask…” said the hero, hesitantly. “And are you really sure everything will be okay? I’ll get into a lot of trouble if they find out I brought a demon lord back with me…”
“No problem. It’s all good.”
“…And I really can’t help you force your way inside our HQ, no matter what you say. That’s just not something I can compromise on, so you might just have to settle for staying outside, okay?”
“Yeah, I get it. No worries. Chill,” I said. I was planning to do something else while you sat around and met with people anyway. Hell, I’d probably end up following my own agenda even if I was let in.There was no need for me to keep pace with the church and its forces. All I wanted was to overthrow the prince and have the church take credit. That was it. All other details were more or less inconsequential. The only reason I had accompanied Nell as far as I had was in order to gather intel—the only thing I needed from the church. Eh. Whatever. Either way, I’m probably just going to end up sitting around until I see out what the church is up to and then figure out where to go with the rest of my plan from there.“You’re not making me feel like this is any less of a bad idea…” The hero spoke rather anxiously as she stopped in front of a run-down building situated in an alleyway. “But either way, we’re here.”At a glance, it looked like some sort of store, one that was so worn out it was barely functional. Without hesitation or worry that she’d arrived at the wrong place, Nell gave the door a series of patterned knocks. A muffled male voice responded to her shortly after.“Terminus,” he said.
“Assemble,” she replied.A small panel above the doorknock opened by sliding to the side. There was hand extending from it. It was open with its palm facing upwards.“Your sigil.”The hero pulled out the seal she’d used back when Lefi and I needed to enter the human city we visited a short while ago and handed it over. The man pulled it inside and went silent as if examining it.The silence persisted for a few, uncomfortable moments.“We have been awaiting your return, my lady.” His tone completely changed by the next time he raised his voice. “We are overjoyed to see that you are still in good health. I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience, but I must ask you to stand by momentarily while I seek a member of our organization that recognizes you before I may allow you inside. Unfortunately, the rules are the rules, and they must be abided.”I sensed the man leave the door without waiting for a response.“Holy shit, that was awesome,” I muttered, impressed. “You guys totally just made the church look like some sort of sinister secret society.”
“…I’m pretty sure that’s the type of impression you’re supposed to keep to yourself,” said Nell, peeved.Yeah, I know. My b, my b.“Nell! You’re back!”The rickety, half-rotted door was slammed open with such force that I thought it was about to fly off its hinges. A single woman dashed out from inside and leapt onto the hero with an overly energetic hug.“It’s great to see you again too, Carlotta.” Nell returned her hug and affectionately wrapped her arms around the woman’s waist.The glomper in question was quite the hottie. She had a great figure and a beautiful face that seemed to belay an air of intelligence. I couldn’t exactly put my finger on why, but she also gave off the impression that she was the type to bear an indomitable will.Her armour looked pretty much exactly like Nell’s. It was of a light design, and when combined with the sword at her waist, made her look like some sort of paladin or holy knight; she was definitely associated with the church. I’m guessing she’s probably one of the ones Nell was talking about when she mentioned that there was a group she was supposed to meet up with and whatnot.“They told me that you went MIA! I was so worried!” exclaimed Glomper McGlompface as she showered the hero with all the affection of an elder sister. “The capital’s security has gotten a lot stricter. We haven’t been able to communicate with any of our agents on the outside lately. Good job making it in!”
“I’m really sorry for all the worry I’ve caused you,” said Nell.
“Don’t worry about it, it’s not your fault! All that matters to me is that you’re safe!” The other knight immediately came to the hero’s defence. “It’s all the higher-ups’ fault for giving you those ridiculous orders.”Ridiculous orders…? Oh, she must be talking about how Nell was sent over to my place. ………Wait a second. “Ridiculous orders?” Bullshit! All she did when she came over was hang around in the hot spring, kick back, and relax before heading straight home!“By the way,” said Nell. “There’s someone I want to introduce you to, Carlotta.”
“There is…?”Only after Nell’s mention did the other knight finally notice me. She let go of Nell and directed a sharp gaze in my direction. She was clearly on guard. Seeing her like that immediately reminded me of a classic Japanese trope. I honestly can’t help but imagine her saying the good old “Kh… Kill me” line after suffering a defeat at the hands of someone with indecent intentions. God damn, I’m a fucking degenerate. [3]“He’s one of my new… party members,” said Nell. “I happened to meet him a while back, and we’ve been sticking together basically ever since. I brought him along because I thought he might be able to lend us a hand. He’s really strong, and pretty trustworthy too.”
“Nice to meet you,” I said as I lightly waved in the holy knight’s direction. “The name’s Wye. You can think of me as something along the lines of an attendant.”
“Are you really sure we can trust him…?” asked the knight. “That mask he’s wearing is making him look really suspicious…”
“I-I’m sure,” said Nell. “I know the mask is kinda weird, but he’s a real good person…”What was that? If you got something to say about this badass mask, then say it to my face goddamit!***TL Notes[1] Kamen Rider reference. Not sure this localizes any better, but basically there’s an army of altered human specimens who only ever say “Yee.”

Finally back with Yuki and the hero, and it seems they’ve met up with where the church guys are, so we’ll see what the plan is next time. Of course, according to our resident Demon Lord, it doesn’t seem to matter to him one way or the other. The prince better see what’s good for him when Yuki comes a’callin’ and surrender right away, but somehow I doubt that’s going to happen. All right, getting to my letter sack, I can see that we have 5 letter, so big thanks to HONEYBEE, JokerNoticedMe (Yes indeed I did), ~Fran Fan, kx, and Zehd Cashew. Also, just letting everyone know, if I reply to you and you reply back asking another question, I can’t reply to that one because WordPress or whatever deals with the comment section doesn’t allow 4 or more replies for some dumb reason. So for example, kx asked what my ideal party would be for fighting a demon lord/king, and when I asked for elaboration, he replied with that answer. But I can’t reply to that, so I’ll answer it here. I’d probably have two tanks, three healers, couple of melee DPS, couple of magic DPS, ranged physical DPS, and EVERY SOLDIER FROM EVERY KINGDOM IN THAT WORLD. Seriously, we’re going up against the big bad. The fuck you thinking about, sending a small party. Send ALL OF THE PEOPLE. So that’ll wrap this up. It’s getting a bit rambly, and I’ve got a dentist appointment in the morning. Yay…. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Church’s Might — Part 1
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“I don’t mind if he joins us. I’m sure you know already, but we aren’t exactly in the best of spots. We’re willing to take all the help we can get, so we’d be glad to have him on board. Especially if he’s strong,” said the knight named Carlotta. “Anyways, why don’t we head inside?”God damn Nell, talk about trust. I almost can’t believe they’re actually going to let me inside just ‘cause you vouched for me. I followed the hero, who traced the other knight’s footsteps as she made her way inside the run-down shack.“What was that…?” I was assaulted by a minor sense of discomfort the moment I walked through the door; an unpleasant sensation shot through my body. The hell…? Did they do something to me just now…?
“Wow. You actually noticed that?” The knight regarded me with a surprised gaze. “I guess that means you really are fairly strong after all.”
“What did you just do…?” I asked.
“No need to be so alarmed. It wasn’t anything out of the norm,” she replied. “While, yes, Nell did introduce you to us, and that does account for a certain degree of credibility, we’re not so foolish as to let just anyone enter our ranks without prior inspection. The fact that you were able to enter the door means you don’t bear us any ill will.”Carlotta took what looked like some sort of document from a man that came from further within the building and began to skim through it, muttering as she did. “It looks like you’re human… And that the mask is just a normal mask. I was almost expecting it to be some sort of magically enhanced device…”
“Huh…?” Hearing the report caused Nell’s face to contort with surprise. She looked like she was about to say something stupid, I gave her the look and used my eyes to tell her to keep quiet while shrugging in response to her confusion.
“What else were you expecting? I only came to help, after all.”
“Hmmm…” she seemed to give me another judging, suspicious look. The tense air lasted for a good bit, but she eventually relaxed. “I see. I hope you’ll excuse us for how rude we were being then.”
“All good.” The calm natural manner in which I spoke failed to relay my real emotions. The truth of the matter was that my heart was pounding. Hooooooooooly shit. This woman be scary. She totally managed to get me to relax the moment before she tested me, just so I’d drop my guard. And she even managed to smile like nothing was up. Goddamn, she’s terrifying. I need an adult.Oh man, I’m lucky I actually listened to Nell when she was talking about how they had items that would let them ID people. I would’ve been taken off the field before I even got to swing if I hadn’t had any countermeasures in place. The reason that the item Carlotta used to analyze me had identified me as a human was obviously not because I had experienced yet another rebirth. Rather, it came in the form of a skill, a skill I had only recently acquired: Disguise.Disguise was what I had ended up choosing over the remote-controlled golem strategy that I had in mind at first; it was just a better use of DP. The skill seemed more or less identical to the one that Lefi used to stop me from seeing her stat numbers. It showed my enemies what I wanted them to see and hid what I didn’t. Of course, I had already set up my character sheet to look a certain way in advance.***General Information

What matters is that I didn’t forget that I needed a pseudonym.All my stats had gone through a bit of tweaking. I adjusted them all to make them significantly lower than the hero’s. My class, thief, was just one I happened to think of and like. I went along with the whole thief theme by giving my falsified agility and dexterity stats a little bit of a boost. The only skills I left on my character sheet were ones that were likely to be found on an actual thief, and I’d intentionally kept all their levels fairly low. Apparently, level 5 skills were only supposed to be found amongst the truly skilled, so I avoided them like the plague.While I could have just left my title section blank, I felt as if not having anything would’ve made my stat page seem a bit empty, so I kept the most normal one visible and hid the rest.I had no idea what the item in question allowed the knight to see, but either way, I assumed I would come off as someone that was fairly capable as far as humans were concerned either way.Of course, the stats I had on display were a far cry away from my actual stats.***General Information

One Hostile to HumanityDP: 104356***I was coming along fairly well, if I did say so myself. My level had risen, and most of my skills were a good bit higher than they’d been just a while ago. I was particularly proud of Sword Mastery, which had finally risen to its second level. Hnnng.I’d also gotten several new skills: Greatsword Mastery, which I had naturally obtained while swinging a massive blade all willy nilly; Disguise, which I bought with DP for the purposes of this outing; and Crisis Detection, which seemed pretty damn useful as far as I was concerned. Unlike the Greatsword Mastery skill, the Disguise skill had been levelled artificially; I had dumped all my skill points into it in order to provide it with a bit of a boost. Like many other skills, its effectiveness was based on both its level and the difference between my stats and the stats of those around me. That was why I was able to deceive many others despite the skill being only level 2.“Wye, was it? I’m going to refrain from asking exactly who you are for now. I’ve no problems with you since you don’t seem to be harbouring any sort of malicious intent,” said the lightly armoured female knight. “Can I count on you to use those skills of yours to help our cause?”
“That’s why I’m here.”
“Thank you. I do appreciate it given how understaffed we are.” She nodded. “Alright, why don’t we make for our destination? For real this time.”And so, Nell and I followed Carlotta deeper into the shabby excuse of a building. I looked around our surroundings from behind my mask as we moved, surveying every last detail out of sheer curiosity. But soon, I was stopped. The hero tapped me on the shoulder and whispered in a voice too quiet for anyone but me to hear. “What did they do? Why do they think you’re human?”“Oh, you know, just messed with my stat page a bit” I whispered back. “And, see, I told you there wouldn’t be any problems.”
“To be honest, I was feeling really anxious and on edge. Thank goodness nothing happened.”Me too. Me too. The she-knight honestly deserved to have found me out. The way she had come snooping the moment I let my guard down had me spooked. Chances were, she’d been planning it all right from the start.“Over here. Watch your feet. The floor here isn’t exactly in the best of states.” Carlotta issued a few instructions after stopping in front of what looked like nothing more than just another wall. “May the Lord guide us to salvation.”A secret panel rose to reveal a hidden pathway the moment she finished reciting some sort of phrase or passcode.“…Woah.” I blinked a few times as I looked on in astonishment. Holy shit. Is that a secret passageway? Fuck yes! I’ve always wanted to try using one of these!The door the knight had opened seemed to lead deeper underground. Dim lights hang from the passage’s ceiling, illuminating a dull looking path.“Let’s go.” And with her words as the cue, the knight once again began to lead us.I couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement rise within me as I followed.***TL Note: I might change the way I’ve chosen to word some of the skills and titles and stuff soon. I’ll make retrospective changes once I’m done deciding what things should be called.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Looks like Yuki had everything figured out. But really, it was fairly obvious. Isekai protags who aren’t human who decide to mingle with humanity usually get a Disguise skill like that, or they’re sent to that world with it. Same old hat trick, but Yuki actually had to work for it. Okay, well not work. More like… give Lefi a chocolate bar and let her rack up the DP for it. On an unrelated note, I’ve been playing a ton of Ace Attorney Trilogy for PS4, plus Yugioh Legacy of the Duelist. They’re both pretty fun games, and I’m happy I bought them.

The Church’s Might — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerOur destination entered our view after a few minutes worth of walking. The fact that the passageway was coming to an end was incredibly obvious. The bright lights that flooded the area beyond the tunnel greatly contrasted the dimmer ones within it.I followed the knight and the hero and slowly headed towards its source.Upon arrival, I found myself within a building that was far removed from the shabby hut I had entered from. It was a cathedral. A great, underground cathedral far larger than anything I could have ever expected given the lacklustre path we had taken to reach it. Gorgeous pillars stretched all the way from its floor to its high rising ceiling, upon which there lay an enormous mural—one that seemed to tell a story based on some sort of religious myth. Brilliant, shimmering chandeliers hung from the ceiling and provided the building with most of its light.The church’s floor was, as one would expect, constructed of a series of shapes and decorated with long, wooden benches. My gaze followed the centre aisle, eventually arriving at an elaborate piece of stained glass. Like the mural, it depicted a tale of sorts. I suspected the item was magically enchanted, as it was the cathedral’s secondary light source. Rays of light almost seemed to be pouring in from the glass window even though it was far outside the sun’s reach.Beneath the glass stood a series of statues. The most well crafted of them portrayed an entity that seemed to be something along the lines of a goddess. She faced the benches and stood with a posture so elegant it made me want to correct my own. Around her was a group of angelic soldiers, each of which was committed to the duty of protecting their lord.The sight of the light shining upon the goddess was so holy in nature that it even made me, in all my atheism, suspect that she might in fact exist. The air was so thick with an essence so divine that it felt as if it would allow no evil to intrude upon it. Though I guess yours truly being here kinda takes that idea and chucks it out the window.I couldn’t help but stare at the vista beneath me as I looked upon it from one of the church’s overpasses. Tunnels like the one we had just exited could be seen lining the wall behind us and the one opposite it. The staircase beside us led down to the cathedral, down to the realm within the literal painting that reeled my mind in.The benches were already populated with a whole series of armed patrons. About half of them wore armour with a design identical to that of Nell’s and Carlotta’s. They too were probably holy knights, paladins that served that of which reigned far above men. The other half of the men present were likely associates from the faction that opposed the prince.“Woah…” I couldn’t help but sigh. That was just how impressed the sight had left me.
“This place sure is awe-inspiring, isn’t it?” asked Nell with a smile. “Seeing it for the first time totally blew me away.”
“Honestly, yeah. It is.”
“This is where we, the church’s knights, have always chosen to assemble in the case that we needed a place to talk behind closed doors,” said Carlotta. “The church has many eyes on it. All of our facilities have eyes on them. This is the only place we’re able to discuss matters away from those that might wish to pry.”
“You sure there’s no problem with you bringing someone you don’t know like me somewhere this important?”
“It isn’t an issue. Again, your ability to enter this space means that you bear us no ill will. Adding to that is the fact that you came with Nell.” Carlotta smiled as she began patting the other girl on the head. “While she is still quite ignorant about the ways of the world, she still does have quite the eye for judging other people.”
“C-Cut it out Carlotta. You’re embarrassing me!” Despite her complaints, Nell was regarding the other girl with a bit of a smile. No two ways about it. They’re definitely as close as sisters.
“That aside, the two of you have excellent timing. We were just about to announce the plan. We don’t have anything in mind for the two of you just yet, but I suggest listening.”With that, the three of us headed downstairs. Nell and I found ourselves a pair of empty seats, while Carlotta marched down the centre aisle and took her place at the dais. Once she reached it, she turned to face the crowd and began to speak.“Men, I address you today as Carlotta De Maya, Commander of the Order of the Faldien Holy Knights. I will be assuming supreme command of this operation.” Her voice was loud, clear, and charismatic. Hearing her caused the troops, who’d been speaking amongst themselves, to snap to attention.
“Wait… she was that important?”
“Mhm. She’s an excellent swordswoman, a talented mage, and just really good at everything she does. She’s really strong. My stats are higher than hers, but I just can’t ever beat her,” said Nell energetically. She seemed more eager to brag about Carlotta than she did herself. “The church thinks of the Faldien Knights as the linchpin to their operations, and she’s the youngest to ever be named its commander.”Of course, the two of us spoke in hushed voices; we made sure not to disturb those around us with our discussions.I did have to agree that the commander was outside the norm. Analyzing her had shown me that her stats were quite far removed from what one would expect from the average human being.***

War Maiden***The first thing I noticed about her stat page was that she had a disproportionate number of weapon-based skills. And all of them were at a decent level. Her Sword Mastery was high that it sat at an overbearing level seven. Both her titles pertained to her prowess in combat. Oh lawdy in heaven save me. Dis woman be skurry.Both her level and her dexterity stat were incredibly high. Wait. Is dex related to sword mastery? ‘Cause I swear Nell has also got a bunch of dex. I mean, my dex is supposed to be super high too, but for some odd reason, I just can’t do the sword. …Might that mean that I’ve just got no talent for swordplay? Naw, no way, right? I mean, I can still use greatswords decently. And my sword mastery skill did level itself up recently. Yeah, you know what, it’s totally not my problem. It’s the swords’ problem. Okay, great. I guess this is where I should probably call it a day and move on to the next topic before I overthink things. Alright brain, next thought please.Analyzing all the humans I came across had allowed me to develop a sort of scale for basically every stat but health and mana. The average child had somewhere between 10 and 100 of each base stat, whereas the average fully grown non-combatant had between 100 and 150. Those that worked in fields that required them to use weaponry had stats that ranged between 150 and 400, though the average individual would have something between 200 and 300, regardless of their precise class. Anything between 400 and 600 was incredibly rare, and seemed to denote that the individual was a master of their craft. I’d only seen three people with anything over 600, and all of them had more or less been freakish outliers. The three were Nell, the guy with the axe (but only while it was boosting all his stats), and the knight standing in front of the podium.The knights that populated the cathedral general had stats around 300 to 400. They were elites. And yet, Carlotta stood out far above them.These numbers only applied to humans. The only demons and beastkin I had ever analyzed were Leila and Lyuu respectively. My sample size was a little bit too small for me to be thinking about averages just yet, especially since I had no idea how strong the two were relative to their peers.“The circumstances are dire. As I am sure you are all aware, men, Prince Riutt Glorio Allysia has gone mad. He has plunged the capital into a state of chaos and used the confusion to usurp the throne from its rightful owner. We, as envoys of justice, must oppose him and right all the wrong that he has willed into existence!”Every knight in the cathedral listened in a solemn silence as her icy cold voice echoed throughout.“There are many of you gathered today. And I know that your expectations, predictions, and thoughts on the matter may differ, but this is one commonality that we all share. We lack the allies we need to pursue our cause. We, alone, lack the power that we need to depose the prince and his ill gotten gains. And it is for that reason that we are here. Do not forget. We are here to take each other’s hands, to cooperate, to ensure that our joint venture sees fruition. Any that object to this sentiment may speak up now.”Not a single soul dared raise their voice in opposition. The entire cathedral almost seemed to be filled with an air of silent fervour.“Excellent.” The paladin’s lips curled into a smile. “Then I will be briefing you on the operation.”Carlotta pulled out a large board and used it to summarize her plans and answer any questions that happened to pop up. The operation was composed of two distinct parts. The first involved restoring communications with a squad standing outside the city’s walls, and then assault the gate with both said squad and a bit over half the troops present in the cathedral. Once enough attention was drawn to the gate, a second, smaller squad would infiltrate the castle. This squad had two objectives. Their primary objective was to rescue the king, who had been recently found alive and kicking within the dungeon lying underneath the castle. Their secondary objective was to capture the prince, if possible. Hmm.. I kind of want to go hand the king a threat or two, so I guess I’ll go a bit ahead of the rescue party and then just hand him over once they get there.“The operation will take place tomorrow night. All of you are to sortie the moment you hear the church’s bell. That is all. Questions?”There was apause, but again, no one raised their voice in objection.“None? Perfect. You are dismissed!” Carlotta raised an arm and finished up her speech with a charismatic cheer. “For Victory!”
“For Victory!” The knights repeated after her in loud, booming voices before rising to their feet and moving out.Likewise, Carlotta descended from the podium and made her way back towards us. “I’m assuming you guys don’t have anywhere to stay since you just got here today,” she said. “I can fix that. Follow me.”***TL Note

The Orphanage — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Mwahahahaha!” I threw my head back and cackled in an over-the-top, ridiculous manner. “Soon! Soon, I, the evil demonic overlord, shall devour you all!”The children I was in the midst of chasing began to scream. But not because they were terrified. Their shouts were filled with all the glee you’d expect from a group of kids engaged in play.Much to her dismay, one of the younger kids happened to stumble over her own legs and trip in her attempt to escape. Rather than capitalizing on the opportunity as any good demon would, I leaned over and took one of her hands in order to help her up.“Careful. The evil demon lord will be sure to catch you if you don’t watch your step.”
“Fanks Mr. Demon Word!” The girl that had tripped giggled as I patted her on the head.
“You’re very welcome. And don’t worry, this doesn’t count as getting caught,” I said before switching personas once more. “For, though I am a demon lord, and while I stand for all that is vile, I remain yet a gentleman that knows the meaning of good sportsmanship. Mwahahahaha!”I began chasing the kids around after giving the one that had tripped a little bit of a head start, but I was soon stopped in my tracks. Three brave looking boys jumped out in front of me, each wielding the power of imagination.“End of the line, demon! We’ll wipe the floor with you!” The one that looked like the group’s leader raised the phantom blade he had grasped in his hand as if to demonstrate its divine radiance.
“So you’ve arrived, heroes.” I crossed my arms and snorted in an arrogant manner. “Fmph. It will take more than the likes of you to unravel my schemes.”
“Yeah, right! Take this, sacred sword attack!” The leader jumped in front of me and swung the weapon visible only to those in the heat of the action.
“Fire magic attack!” The second boy held out one of his arms and pretended to channel a burst of magical energy.
“Sacred sword strike number two!” The final kid, who, like the first, apparently wielded a legendary blade, swung in an over-the-top, exaggerated manner.
“Rrrraarghghghg!?” I jumped and then landed with a backwards stumble as if to demonstrate that their combined might had blown me away. “C-Curse you, heroes! You may have defeated me, but this is far from your, humanity’s, final trial! Even though I will fall today, there shall soon be a second demon lord. And if you defeat him, a third! There will be no end to demonic monarchs, and no end to the struggles that you must f-woah!”Much to my surprise, the kids, who’d realized that the game had come to an end, all began running towards me.“Wait wait, come on guys, stop that! I’m still in the middle of a monologue. And one at a time, come on! And you, don’t jump at me like that! What’ll you do if you end up hurting yourself!”Fortunately, I’d managed to catch the kid that had launched himself through the air before he fell to the ground. Seeing that he was fine, the others started emulating him. It didn’t take long for me to find myself on the ground with a dogpile’s worth of kids on top of me.“They sure have gotten attached to you.” The hero giggled as she squatted down next to me and peered over my face. “And I almost can’t believe how fast you got used to pretending to be a demon lord.”
“I’m kind of the real thing, so y’know. Nothing special.”I wonder what these kids would think if they learned that I really was a demon lord. Doubt that’s anything they’ll ever think up. Not even in their wildest dreams.“I’m also surprised that you’re this good at keeping kids entertained.”
“That’s just ‘cause I do this all the time back home,” I said. Though, things are a bit different back in the dungeon. Everyone wants to be the demon lord instead. I have to pretend to be a hero and get vanquished, which is kind of the opposite of what’s probably the norm.Of course, the difference in culture stemmed from the fact that the dungeon’s resident children thought a lot more highly of demon lords than they did heroes. For obvious reasons.“It’s not too hard. I’m sure you’d be good at it too,” I said with a smirk. “Whaddaya say? How about you give it a shot? You know what, if you do it, I’ll even throw in one of these awesome masks.”
“No thanks.” Nell shot me down immediately. “I don’t really want any weird masks.”Wow Nell. How could you?Watching over our interaction caused the knight that had shown us to the orphanage to smile wryly as she spoke to the woman standing beside her. “I really am sorry for showing up and asking you to give them a place to stay on such short notice.”
“Please, don’t worry about it.” The woman, the orphanage’s director, shook her head with a gentle smile. “We would be nowhere without all of the church’s support. We at least owe you this much. And besides, the children are overjoyed.”The pair’s conversation stemmed from the fact that, last night, Carlotta had led us not to some sort of barracks or inn, but rather, an orphanage. Specifically, it was an orphanage run and supported by the church. While it wasn’t exactly what one would call their first choice when looking for lodgings, it was the only space available to us. Most of the capital’s inns had closed their doors, and all the church’s dormitories were packed full with the troops to be deployed in tonight’s upcoming operation. The orphanage was quite literally the only place we could have spent the night.As one might suspect, the inns hadn’t been the only things to shut down. In fact, the majority of the capital’s stores had also done exactly that. The cause was politics. Those responsible for the coup had locked down the capital and effectively blocked it off from the outside world. The capital did not have much in the way of food generation. All of their consumables came in the form of imports from the outside world—imports that the blockade had halted. The result was obvious: a food shortage.The merchants responsible for supplying the city with its nourishment stopped coming. As cunning gold mongers, they knew that visiting the capital was unsafe. There was a chance that they would be caught in the midst of a skirmish and ultimately perish as an unintended consequence of the conflict.More importantly, however, was that safety and profit were not necessarily linked to one another. Smaller and medium-sized companies that dared make the trek found that they wouldn’t even see the benefits. The soldiers situated near the entrance would confiscate their goods and pay them only a fraction of the cost the merchants had to pay to obtain them in the first place. It simply wasn’t a profitable affair. There was no reason for any sane self-made merchant to bother stopping by the capital.Larger firms and their suppliers had it a bit easier. They could safely enter and exit the city without being subject to the army’s unreasonable demands. However, they too were merchants. They were after money. Not charity. All their foodstuffs were priced at many times their value in more decent times. The capital’s cost of living had gone up drastically.To make matters worse, the army had confiscated almost all the extra food that had existed in the city at the time of their hostile takeover. And as such, the capital’s citizens found themselves in peril. The situation was awful. They had to scramble and compete in order to scrape together enough food just to get through each day.Despite blatantly subjecting the citizens to harm, the prince and his dirty little crew were gaining momentum. They were technically still considered rebels. However, they had been working extensively in order to transform all manner of backlash into naught but praise. Of course, the prince’s faction hadn’t exactly been able to affect those that had opposed it to begin with, but they had managed to convince many neutral noble parties that allying with them was to their benefit. Seeing the pace at which the prince had been gaining allies in recent times had also caused many opportunists to declare their allegiance to him. It was obvious that he would soon have the right to rule in his grasp.The timer was ticking in his favour. And the moment it stopped would be the moment those who opposed him lost their just cause. That was most likely why the church was working on such a tight schedule. I highly doubted that the operation would be happening the day after it was announced under any normal circumstance.“I’m really sorry for making you entertain the children.” The director looked at me with an apologetic frown. “I know that you’re our guests and that we should be treating you much better, but…”
“Don’t worry about it. It’s no big deal,” I said. “It’s only fair that we help out any way we can seeing how you let us stay the night for free.”I shrugged and flashed the director a grin. Not that she could see it given the whole mask situation.“I know I said I wouldn’t ask you about your identity, but my curiosity is killing me,” said Carlotta. “Do you have kids? You look a bit too young for it.”
“Nah. I just have something along the lines of a pair of younger sisters back home. I play with them all the time, so I’m pretty used to this kinda thing.”
“Mr. Mask! Mr. Mask!” One of the kids walked up to me and gave my shirt a gentle tug. “Can you please pretend to be a demon lord again?”
“Sure. If it is your wish, then I shall comply so long a—” I started to get into character, but I was cut off by the sound of the kid’s rumbling stomach. “Sounds like you’re getting a bit hungry over there.”
“Mhm…” the kid frowned. “But we all are, so I gotta do my best not to complain.”Right. What am I, stupid? The city’s got a food shortage. Of course, they’re hungry. I couldn’t really tell since they all seemed so energetic, but I guess that was just ‘cause they were holding it in. Thinking back on it, I realized that breakfast hadn’t been composed of much of anything at all. Chances are, they probably haven’t even had a decent meal recently. Damn it, Yuki. Realize these things faster next time.“Well, I guess we can’t really do much playing on empty stomachs now, can we?” I crouched a bit and ruffled the kid’s hair before getting back up and turning towards the hero. “Hey Nell. Get over here and lend me a hand.”
“Huh? W-wait, what’s happening?” The hero seemed totally confused, so I grabbed her by the arm and started dragging her off towards the kitchen. “Wait! Where are you taking me!?”
“To make food. I’m not about to watch a group of kids starve themselves, so I’mma grill up some meat. Doing everything by myself would take way too long, so I’m making you help.” I turned towards the director. “I hope you don’t mind us borrowing your kitchen real quick.”
“Please, feel free.”And with the director’s permission, I dragged Nell off to work.“Wasn’t he supposed to be a member of her party? She’s a hero, so that should mean that he’s supposed to effectively function as her attendant, right?” Carlotta, who had been watching the whole thing, made a bit of a confused remark as we left. “Why is he the one dragging her around?”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Boy, Boss Young’un is pushing these chapters out fast, isn’t he? I almost can’t keep up. At the rate he’s going, I might have to go into my Forbidden Binder of Topics to Talk About just to keep up with these chapters. Only three letters today. Understandable, since the last chapter was just the other day, so people haven’t thought about anything to ask me. So big thanks to Dawn Seeker (proudtobeabrony), Zehd Cashew, and Yashuul. I’m not really expecting to get a lot of questions this chapter either, since while editing this one, Boss Young’un already sent out 93 for us to look at, but if you have questions you’d like me to answer, leave them below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer them.

The Orphanage — Part 2
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“Okay kids, go get your bowls and form a line!” The hero turned to face the children after using a ladle to stir the pot of beef stew situated on top of a table in the orphanage’s courtyard. Though orphanages often led one to think of poverty, the lot was surprisingly large. There was plenty of space for the children to frolic about and play. “You won’t get any if you don’t wait your turn, so don’t even think about cutting in front of each other!”
“Okay!!” The children eagerly responded before obediently arranging themselves into a neat, single file line.While the kids were the reason I had initially prepared the meal, they weren’t the only ones attending our little chow session. Carlotta and the orphanage’s director were also both present and accounted for.“That dish has got quite the alluring smell,” said Carlotta. “What was it called again?”
“Uhmm… I think he said it was called beef stew. He did all the flavouring and stuff, so I have no idea how he made it. Would you like some, Carlotta? There’s a whole lot, and I’m sure the children won’t be able to finish it all by themselves.”
“I may as well have a bit.”
“What about you, Miss uhm… Firni, was it?”
“Well…I suppose a tiny bit wouldn’t hurt.” The orphanage’s director nodded hesitantly. “Thank you so much for doing this. You’re supposed to be our guests, so we should be the ones showing you hospitality. And yet…”
“That’s alright.” Nell smiled. “He said this already, but we were the ones that suddenly showed up on your doorstep and asked to stay the night. Think of this as just our way of covering our debts.”While there was more than enough stew to go around, it wasn’t the only dish on the menu. I was situated by the next table over, carving the second dish, a whole roast of meat, into bite-sized chunks the kids could enjoy with ease.They seemed to find the sight of me chopping a larger piece of meat into several smaller ones fascinating, as their eyes were practically glued to my hands as they carried out the process. Okay no, that’s total bull. They just really can’t wait to dig in and I know it.Chances were, they were imagining how the two dishes would taste. Though they didn’t quite seem to recognize either dish, they clearly had very high expectations—which was fine. Both were delicious. I was sure they’d be happy with what they got. I, however, wasn’t. The normal Japanese line of thought was to cook up some sort of curry. That was just the standard when it came to feeding a bunch of hungry kids. But there wasn’t any rice. I hadn’t been expecting the situation, so I hadn’t bothered bringing any sort of grain-based food with me. As such, I had to think up something that would be okay as just a roux without anything to accompany it. I ended up picking beef stew. Even though it didn’t satisfy my craving for a Japanese aesthetic.“Next!” I called for the line to move after placing several pieces of meat on top of one of the kids’ plates.
“That’s me!” The next immediately stepped up, held out her bowl, and smiled. “That mask you’ve got on right now looks super cool, Mr. Mask!”
“You’ve got a good eye, young lady. You know what we do with good girls like you?” I smirked. “We give ‘em an extra piece of meat.”
“Yay!”I garnished the beef stew in the girl’s bowl with a few slices of meat and then called for the line to move yet again.Though I’d called it an extra piece, the number of pieces post-mask-compliment more or less ended up becoming the standard. Everyone had gotten an extra slice because everyone had immediately picked up on the fact that praising my mask would get them more food. Heh. They might just be saying it for the reward right now, but I’m sure they’ll turn around eventually if they keep doing it. They’re sure to learn just how badass these masks are. Not that I’ll actually be sticking around long enough for that to happen. But y’know.Inconsequential as it was, I had in fact traded in my mask for another while hanging around in the kitchen. My current mask wasn’t full faced like my last one. There was a hole where the mouth was so I could join everyone in eating. I knew for a fact that the mask would end up being more annoying than anything when it came to meal time. It would get in my way by virtue of the fact that it was a literal physical barrier between my mouth and anything I wanted to put inside of it. I didn’t want to tear it off and end up showing my face. That would just make me feel like an idiot. That said, there wasn’t much of a point to hiding behind a mask to begin with. But I didn’t care. Truth be told, all of my behaviour stemmed from a rather shallow thought—wearing a mask made me feel like a badass. My justifications had all been excuses I came up with in order to provide myself with a sense of self-validation.“Are you really okay with giving away all this for free?” Carlotta frowned. “It must have cost you quite the pretty penny. I can tell that you used both monster meat and plenty of spices.”
“It’s fine.” I shrugged as I watched the children happily devour their meals. “The monsters I got this meat from weren’t all that strong. It doesn’t take me much effort to hunt a bunch of them. The spices are… more or less homemade, so I didn’t really incur any significant expenses on that front either.”The only thing that had cost me anything was the base I used for the beef stew. And it had just been a minor DP expense.I had only done what I had for my own self-satisfaction. All the time I spent around Illuna and Shii really had changed the way I looked at kids. I didn’t really like them all that much in my last life. But now, things were different. Seeing them suffer tore at my heartstrings. I helped them because I didn’t want my heart to bleed for them. I immediately realized that I was likely prone to keep this behaviour up going forward, so I promptly adopted a new policy: I wouldn’t go out of my way to seek out kids just to help them, but I would help those in my immediate vicinity.I had been in a bit of a barbecue kinda mood, so I ended up making the whole roast out in the yard. The smell of roasted meat in the midst of a food shortage had drawn many a person to the front of the orphanage.“Hey… you smell something?” asked a passerby.
“Yeah man. It’s not anything I recognize, but man it smells good. It’s making me real hungry,” replied another.It didn’t take long for a crowd to form on the street in front of the orphanage. Many peered in through the gate, their eyes tainted with a hungry jealousy. Hmm… You know what? This might actually be a pretty decent opportunity.“Hey Nell, you mind taking over for a bit?”
“Huh? Uhm, sure.”I left serving everything up to the hero and headed out towards the crowd.“Are you assholes hungry?” I took up an imposing stance by crossing my arms as I posed the question.
“Y-Yeah!” Though they started off regarding me suspiciously, a few of the crowd’s members soon came to realize my intent.
“Do you miss the taste of meat?”
“Hell yeah!!” The second response came swiftly, and carried much more energy than the first. The crowd was getting fired up.
“Then meat you’ll get,” I said. “But only if you lend me a hand.”I opened up my item box and poured a bunch of monster corpses out onto the street.“U-Uh huh…” The crowd faltered in response to the sudden introduction of a copious amount of food.The meat in my inventory could be split into two distinct categories: meat that had been butchered, and meat that still happened to be in the shape of a monster. I had planned to give all the meat that was ready to be turned into food to the orphanage. While that would have left me with plenty to sate my appetite, the stuff it left me with would have been much more inconvenient to use. I decided to bear with it, however, for the orphanage’s sake.Or at least I would have had I not found a sudden, convenient source of cheap labour. Might as well use what you got, right?“There’s no more stew. So you ain’t getting any of the stuff you’re smelling.” I said. “But, there is still plenty of meat to go around. Or at least there would be if it was actually ready to go. As I’m sure you can see, it’s a bit underprepared. And you know what that means. If you want to eat, you gotta work.”A few members of the crowd stepped forward.“That’s somethin’ I can handle, no sweat. Shop’s closed right now, but I run a butchery. I got no problem doin’ some of the work I normally handle erryday,” said a member of the crowd.
“Count me in too. I may not look like it, but I used to be an adventurer. And I was fairly proficient when it came to chopping up monsters for their parts,” added another.
“You can leave all the cooking to me! I cook for a nearby restaurant,” said a third.
“I’ll bring us some plates! I’ve got some big enough to use for this kind of stuff back home!” said a fourth.The unorganized mass soon formed into strike teams and got to work.“Good,” I smirked. “Now listen up. The only people that get to eat are those that contribute. And no touching the food until you’re done your part. Don’t worry about there being too little. ‘Cause once you’re done, I’ll shove so much down your throat that you’ll be begging for me to stop!”I continued to act all cocky as I voiced one last bit of encouragement. To be fair, I had every right to be as full of myself as I wanted. I was the one supplying the food, after all. This whole event was literally impossible without me.Mwahahahaha! I cackled internally. Work, ignorant plebians. Work and provide me all the cheap labour I could ever want!The crowd in front of the orphanage caused others to raise questions and flock to it. I increased the amount of monster meat available in response to the change in the size of the crowd, therefore increasing the amount of work to be completed. That, in turn, generated more noise, which caused people to notice the crowd. It was a vicious cycle, one that kept feeding into itself over and over.It didn’t take long for the street the orphanage sat on to transform into what was basically the venue for an impromptu festival.<– Prev — Next –>

The Orphanage — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe sizzling of fat dripping onto an open flame filled my ears and the delicious scent of roasted meat wafted through my surroundings. Laughter filled the air as the crowd passed around a bunch of booze. The alcohol was a recent addition that someone had brought along just for the occasion. There was even a bard present, and he had started singing one of the songs he’d claimed was his best. His performance caused the people around him to clap and cheer with glee. Although not all of the children had finished eating, those that had been satiated were running around and happily playing a game of tag.Likewise, I was also enjoying myself. I went back and forth between the drunks and the kids. I’d eat with the former group and play with the latter. The only one that seemed even the slightest bit troubled by the current situation was the hero. I couldn’t really tell exactly whose fault it was, but it was definitely either mine or the kids’, as she was diligently trying her best to watch over them all to make sure they didn’t get hurt.Carlotta and the director were sitting a bit off to the side. The first of the two was watching Nell with a wry smile, while the latter was regarding the entire situation with a full-faced open expression of happiness. Her orphanage had become a symbol of felicity. The atmosphere around it was so full of joy that it almost made it seem like the capital wasn’t in such dire straights after all.Observing the situation reminded me that humans could only truly be open, social, and happy if their most basic needs were satisfied. Food was a must. All living things needed it to well, live. Those that hadn’t any of it would have to fight amongst themselves for scraps or challenge those that did, lest they wanted to risk leaving the mortal plane. And that was why the capital’s citizens had been keeping to themselves. It’s pretty hard to have a big heart on an empty stomach, after all.“Tag! You’re it Mr. Mask!” A nearby kid tapped me on the back. He quickly ran off as quickly as he’d come.
“Oh no! Well, then I guess I better catch someone!” I said. I quickly approached the hero and plopped a hand down on her shoulder. “Well Nell, that’s a tag. You’re it.”
“Huh!? Wait, I’m playing too!?”
“Alright everyone! Make sure you run away from Nell unless you want her to catch you!”The children screamed joyfully and scattered throughout the orphanage’s yard. Although she kept her troubled smile on at first, the hero eventually relaxed and started to warm up to the idea. “Come back here so I can catch you!”Soon, she too was amongst the ranks of those frolicking about in the yard.That, unfortunately, was when our little luncheon turned party was interrupted.A group of four soldiers had appeared at one end of the impromptu venue and began pushing their way through the crowd.“What’s going on here!?” the man who appeared to be the group’s leader shouted. “Weren’t you told that all your extra food was supposed to go to the country!?”All the noise the crowd was making died down immediately, as if it had never existed to begin with. The mood took an instant turn for the worse. Everyone was possessed by a sudden wave of gloom. Their despondency was laced with anger, as most of the people in the crowd had their eyes narrowed into hateful glares.Despite the fact that they had countless sets of angry eyes on them, the soldiers didn’t seem to mind. They simply ignored them and continued heading straight towards the center of all the commotion, the orphanage. Goddamn. They give no fucks. You know, I’m almost impressed. You gotta have balls to be that bold. Like shit, talk about mental fortitude.“I can’t believe this. How could all of you do this? We’re fighting so hard for this country’s sake, your sake, yet you guys don’t share all this good food with us.” The soldier frowned and tried to look as pitiful as he could. Unfortunately for him, he was a terrible actor, and there wasn’t a soul in the crowd willing to sympathize with him to begin with. Everyone present wore their hatred on their sleeves. “Well? Which one of you is the rebel that decided to hide all this food from the crown?”I put my foot forward to confront the man, but Carlotta stepped out in front of me before I could announce my presence.“Rebel? That’s quite the accusation. This is prey that I hunted myself. I’m free to do whatever I want with it, aren’t I?”I gave her a dubious stare, to which she responded with a quick glance before turning back towards the soldiers. I could tell that she was telling me to just leave things to her.Unlike Carlotta, who looked calm and relaxed, the hero was on guard. Her expression was grim, and she had naturally taken a stance that would allow her to draw her weapon at any given moment.“Of course not,” scoffed the soldier. “Alshir, our glorious capital city, is in the midst of a food crisis. A food crisis! It’s something that we, its people, all need to join hands to overcome. We’re all in this together. We can’t just have people like you gorging themselves while everyone else suffers.”
“We’re all in this together, are we?” Carlotta raised an eyebrow. “Then why haven’t I seen any evidence of the military distributing food to the people?”
“Don’t ask me, I’m just a soldier. There’s no way I would know anything about rationing out food. All I can tell you is that we’ve received an order from the crown, and that the order is to confiscate any extra food so we can turn it into supplies,” said the soldier with an obnoxious grin. “So we’ll be taking everything here. I’m sure you’ve all already had your fill.”The crowd immediately began to jeer. Shouts of “You’ve gotta be kidding me,” and “Screw you assholes! You don’t give two shits about us!” resounded throughout, but it didn’t last for long. The soldier in charge shut everyone up with a nasty glare.“Still not satisfied? Well, how about this.” He looked Carlotta up and down with a vulgar gaze, licked his lips, and continued. “You may be dressed like a knight, but with a body like that, you’d be more suited to being a whore. How about this. We’ll be nice. We’ll let you come with us and even have a bit more food. If you let us share you with everyone we feed, that is.”The leader broke into a hearty laugh, one his minions promptly joined in on. Oh great. Now they’re not even trying to hide the fact that they’re total scum.The knight momentarily narrowed her eyebrows into a death stare, but quickly shook off their provocation. She remained relaxed with her arms folded in front of her chest, likely because she knew that they were just trying to bait her, and that taking action would only make things worse.Man, the hell is wrong with these people? Aren’t they supposed to be soldiers? You know, people responsible for protecting the country? All I see is a group of thugs. Wait, right! I totally forgot. The church is under surveillance. Its every move is being monitored. That probably means that this whole thing is just a ruse. They must have sent these obnoxious, poorly disciplined morons our way in response to the whole banquet thing we had going. This is probably just their way of instigating an incident. They sent these aggravating douchebags our way for that exact reason. They want us to kill them so they can use it to fuel some sort of political move. If that’s the case, then there’s probably someone watching over the whole scenario, someone responsible for reporting back to HQ…I promptly checked the map for anyone that happened to match my criteria. Bingo. There’s a guy in one of those back alleys over there. He’s acting all sneaky like, but he’s definitely staring right at us.I had figured out the enemy’s trap. As well as a solution. I was free to eliminate the thugs so long as I first dispatched the observer. There was no reason not to do exactly that. My decision was made, and I was about to act upon it.But then, it happened.One of the soldiers accidentally bumped into a little girl whilst laughing at his boss’ joke.“Nooo! My stew!”The sudden force caused her to drop her bowl, whose contents were promptly spilt all over the man and his armour.“Tsk.” The man clicked his tongue. “Goddamn you, you stupid brat!”It was all his fault. He was the one that bumped into her. But he didn’t care. The sorry excuse for a soldier did the unthinkable. He drew his blade, raised it overhead, and moved to slay the child whose meal he had ruined.“The fuck!?” My eyes widened. Are you fucking serious? Are these retards seriously taking this shit this far!?Panic coursed through me. I poured an excess of force into my legs and used it to kick off the ground. I flew through the air with such force that it had almost looked like I had pulled an instant transmission. I appeared in front of the soldier out of nowhere and smashed my fist into the flat of his blade.There was an audible crack. The sword snapped where I’d hit it, and the tip, which would have taken the girl’s life had I been any slower to react, rolled onto the ground.“Huh? My weapo-”My reflexes kicked in before I could process another thought. I twisted my hips and delivered a powerful roundhouse kick. My foot drove itself deep into the soldier’s neck and sent him flying into an area where no one was standing. He promptly collapsed, crumpling into a despondent, crippled heap. Aw crap. I totally just fucked up, didn’t I? God damn it, Yuki. Think before you hit.“You’ve done it now, you little shit!”Dumbfuck number two drew his sword and attempted to attack. I had no choice but to do something about it, so I shifted my body slightly and spun around him while delivering yet another spinning kick. It landed in the back of the soldier’s head, instantly incapacitating him.I glanced to the side and noticed retard number three, who had moved to attack my exposed rear. I took a stance to inform him that I had accepted his challenge, but he was suddenly blown away before I even had a chance to act.In his place stood Carlotta, who had taken a pose like someone that had just thrown a punch.“Hmph.” She snorted as she shook off the blood that had gotten onto the back of her arm guard. “A blade is too good for the likes of you.”
“You bastards! How dare you!? You’ll pay for th—” The leader attempted to draw his blade as he yelled, but Nell’s scabbard came in from his blind spot and struck him in the back of the neck before he could so much as finish his rant.The attack rattled the scumbag’s brain and knocked him out cold. He fell to his knees, before collapsing into a heap on the ground.“Geez…” she sighed. “Why does everyone have to be so quick to resort to violence?”Seeing all four soldiers defeated caused the crowd to break into a deafening roar. They cheered with such vigour that the very air seemed to tremble in response.I wanted to join them and loose a shout as I took a victory pose. But now wasn’t the time. “Sorry, but I’m going to have to ask you guys to take care of things over here. Make sure you give the girl they attacked an extra bowl of stew.”
“Huh? Wait, where are you going?” The hero asked.
“They had a fifth on standby just watching over the situation, but he just took right the hell off. I’mma go take care of him before this whole situation spirals outta control.”The observer had wall jumped onto the roof of a nearby building and then started running hopping from rooftop to rooftop in order to make his way back to what I assumed would be some sort of superior. Wait a second. The hell is up with his moves? Is he supposed to be some sort of ninja or something?I figured I had explained enough, so I kicked off in the wannabe ninja’s direction without another word.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, leave it up to the freakin’ soldiers to come in and ruin everyone else’s day. However, looks like Carlotta was trying to keep them calmed down, but trying to attack that little girl just crossed the line. Now the people supporting the prince are going to find out what kind of dragon they pulled the tail of. If I was Yuki, I’d just go to the prince, change my title to “Supreme Dragon’s Owner” and watch him urinate himself until he dies from dehydration. That would be amusing to watch, if a bit smelly. All right, only one letter in the Sack today. Understandable, since it was a double upload. So big thanks to Cielitojeff for your question. Remember, if you’ve got something you want me to answer, leave it in the comments below and I’ll answer. See y’all very soon for the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Change of Plans
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“And there he goes. He sure was quite the entertainer,” said Carlotta. She continued staring in the direction the masked man had dashed off in as she spoke to the girl beside her. “I’m not quite sure what else I could have expected from a man that pretended to be a member of your party just so that we would let him aid us.”
“Huh…? W-wait, you could tell!?”
“Of course,” chuckled Carlotta. “It was fairly obvious.”The commander of the Faldien Holy Knights had an accurate grasp of the hero’s personality. She knew that Nell wasn’t the type of girl to rely on the help of others. She was more likely to shoulder all her problems on her own than she was to recruit a party member. Despite that, she had returned with one that claimed to be something along the lines of an attendant.Carlotta had her suspicions from the start, but now, she felt that she understood everything.She tore her eyes away from his afterimage and momentarily directed them towards the place where the masked man had stood before initiating combat. His location was marked with an imprint. An imprint in the shape of the man’s shoe. As a knight well versed in the art of combat, she knew that such a footprint was something that only showed up as a result of the incredible amount of force the man had exerted when he had launched himself off the ground.Of course, she had already known from the start that he would be a powerful asset. But only now had she truly caught a glimpse of exactly what that meant. The probing that she had done yesterday informed her of only a few things. The first was his race. The second was that he bore no ill will. The final bit of information told her about his equipment. In other words, none of it had pertained to his strength. She had no idea exactly how good a fighter he was, only that he was skilled enough to detect that he was being inspected.The truth of the matter was that the bit on his race was incorrect. But Carlotta had no way of knowing that, and the fact that she didn’t ultimately served to benefit both the church and the demon lord.All Carlotta deduced from observing the few moments he had spent in battle was that he was at least as proficient as the hero herself. If he was an adventurer, then he would likely have been one of the few monsters to exceed the realm of the adamantine and enter that of the orichalcum.And that, as far her deductions were concerned, was likely why he bore the mask he did. It was to protect him. To hide his identity and therefore ensure that his participation in the capital liberation had no effect on his everyday life. He knew he was powerful. He knew that many different factions would vie for his aid and most likely destroy the peaceful days he enjoyed should he be exposed.She understood. He had only come because he absolutely had to. Because he realized that the country was in peril. Because he knew that it had come time to act for the betterment of those that needed his aid.Though he had lied to her, though he refused to tell her who he truly was, Carlotta knew that he was no villain. And it was not just because she trusted Nell, who had vouched for him. She had watched the manner in which he interacted with the children.Under normal circumstances, the knight would have tried to recruit him given both his immense power and his benevolence. She would have informed him that the church would welcome him with open arms. But this time, she chose to decline. A choice she had made out of respect for his obvious desire for freedom.The knight’s thoughts went unconfirmed. In truth, they were but a misunderstanding. But either way, she had ultimately ended up developing a deep respect for the demon lord whose name she had yet to uncover.“U-Uhm, just to be clear,” said Nell. “I didn’t lie because I wanted to harm the church!”
“I understand,” replied her boss. “I can guess what happened. The man that you brought us is one with a noble heart. He must have insisted that he wanted to resolve the capital’s dilemma. And he must have taken up a mask because he did not want to expose himself to a life filled with political drama.”
“Uh… noble heart…? Well uhm, yeah, sure, let’s go with that.” Nell was confused, but she ended up recovering just enough to provide Carlotta a response that didn’t affirm or deny her thoughts.
“I won’t ask any more about his background,” declared Carlotta. “Besides, there’s something more important we ought to focus on right now.”The knight glanced at her surroundings before shouting a pair of names. “Fi! Gui!”
“We are here to serve!” A pair of women almost seemed to emerge from the shadows next to her. Neither’s face was visible; they were both hidden from view.The two were Carlotta’s guards. Of course, someone as powerful as herself didn’t actually need guards. In fact, the commander of the Faldien order had insisted that she would be fine without them.Her superiors, however, vetoed her decision. She was one of the most important paladins. She held a position not far from the organization’s apex. There was no way her superiors could allow her to venture out alone. She wasn’t happy with their decision, but this time around, she was grateful. The guards’ presence had proved useful.“The guy with the mask sure was amazing,” said the first guard. “His attacks were so fast I couldn’t follow them.”
“Hmph,” snorted the second. “He is nothing but a piece of trash that sticks to Lady Nell and speaks to Lady Carlotta in an unacceptably rude manner. I’ve wanted to stab him in the back on multiple occasions already.”
“That’s enough banter for now.” Carlotta immediately began issuing orders the moment the two spilled their grievances. “There’s been a change of plans. Begin the operation immediately. Send the signal and tell all units standing by to act.”
“A-Are you sure that’s a good idea, ma’am?”
“We’ve got no choice. We’ve caused too much of a commotion. Waiting until nightfall will do nothing but rob us of the initiative. Carry out your orders immediately. Have the distraction do its job, and then move on the castle at once. We’re racing against the clock.”
“Yes, ma’am!” The two stealthy subordinates left the scene immediately.
“…Now, I suppose I should play my part as well.” Carlotta muttered under her breath before moving to stand in front of the crowd, which was still cheering in response to the soldiers’ defeat.“Listen well, citizens! I am Carlotta De Maya, a paladin affiliated with the Order of the Faldien Holy Knights!” Her dignified voice caused those around her to immediately quiet down and pay attention. “Look around you! Witness the state of our proud capital city and see how we have fallen from grace!”The example she pointed towards was the soldiers. The public’s opinion on them was obvious. Not a single soul had bothered waking them or assisting them in any which way. They’d been left where they fell.“The current administration is doing nothing but unfairly oppressing us with a tyrannical iron fist. But time is on its side. The administration will gain the power it needs to tighten its grip on the throne. I am sure you can easily predict how the future will remain should they not be removed from power.”Disturbed, fearful murmurs spread through the crowd.“But worry not. Do not lose hope. For we, the church, shall not allow it to happen. We shall soon reclaim our futures through our own actions. We shall serve to guide ourselves to prosperity!”Carlotta paused, which prompted the crowd to break into a cheer. Not a single voice questioned any of her statements or assumptions. It was a result brought about in part because the crowd had already been worked up to begin with, and in part because of Carlotta’s outstanding charisma.“Listen well! We, the church, shall now initiate a battle, a conflict that is necessary to restore our lives to their rightful states! I beseech all of you whose hearts are filled with courage. Take up arms and fight against the injustice that oppresses you! God’s will is with us. Victory is ours for the taking!”Again, the crowd burst into an excited cheer, its excitement at an all-time high. The men and women within it raised their fists to the sky as they rallied themselves to fight for a better tomorrow.<– Prev — Next –>

To the Castle
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixI followed the observer as he leapt from roof to roof. He was moving like a character straight out of an action movie, but for some odd reason, the way he hopped reminded me of a rabbit. Indignant, angry thoughts coursed through me as I followed him. Chasing him was a royal pain. I was going to catch him. And when I did, I was going to make him pay.A random thought hit me as I moved. You know, this might just be the chance I’ve been waiting for.I had been able to detach myself from the hero and the order she was affiliated with in a manner that didn’t scream suspicious. I likely would have been stuck as a part of one of the church’s squads had I stuck around with them any longer, and that would have been bad. I would have lost the opportunity to act on my own. As such, I had been thinking about how I would eventually part from them. But now, I didn’t have to.Bunny boy, the ninja wonder, was heading straight towards the royal castle. Following him would ultimately allow me to enter the enemy stronghold. The path he took would quite literally lead me right where I needed to be. I had realized along the way that our little incident had stirred up far too much of a commotion. The prince and his allies would soon realize that the church was out to dethrone him. It was only a matter of time. And catching the observer wouldn’t buy much of it. It’s not like I can get any intel out of him either. He’s just another agent. I doubt he’ll know much of anything at all.My best course of action was to continue shadowing him. And as such, I stopped thinking about the many ways I could beat him senseless and continued to simply tail him from a distance. With my Stealth skill active the whole way, of course.The act of chasing him on its own was repetitive. I kicked off a roof, fluttered through the air, stuck a landing, and repeated. I had found it rather difficult at first. I kept tripping all over myself and almost plummeting to the ground. It took a while, but I did get the hang of it eventually.I had thought about deploying my wings instead. I hadn’t been all that interested in mastering parkour. But alas, I chose to. I hadn’t wanted to run the risk of being seen with them, no matter how low the risk may be. There was still a chance of someone spotting me even without my wings, of course, but realizing that I was present would be all the act would amount to. Being spotted with my wings out, on the other hand, would basically waste all the effort I’d spent pretending to be human in the first place. And I wasn’t about to chuck my sunk costs out the window for no real reason.Wait. Are demon lords actually demons? Or are they technically two different things? My race kinda changed when I evolved, and I don’t really think you actually need to be a demon to lord over them, right? Just what is a demon lord anyway?Most of the races were fairly well defined. Humans were well… human. Beastkin had animalistic features. Demi-humans such as dwarves and elves were defined as creatures that were human-like in nature. Demons, however, weren’t nearly as well defined. They were quite literally thought of as everything else. Anything even remotely humanoid that wasn’t a human, demi-human, or beastkin was a demon. If we go by that definition, then I guess I technically am a demon.The issue with the aforementioned definitions was that they were fairly ambiguous. Specifically, there was no clear line between a demi-human and a demon. Demi-humans were thought of as demi-humans simply because the humans had widely accepted them as such—a fact that had seemingly resulted from the fact that they were slightly more human-like in nature. Demons, on the other hand, apparently followed the general trend of being slightly more hotblooded and combat-oriented.But again, the terms were vague and purely up to one’s subjective judgement.Despite starting off as an archdemon myself, I didn’t know all that much about demons. One of the few things I’d heard about them was that they lacked unity, which made sense given how they were defined.There were too many different groups shoved under the umbrella of the demonic. It only made sense for them to be disparate in nature. The one similarity the demon tribes shared, according to Lefi, was that they were pretty much all musclebrains. When most people thought of demons, they thought of members of the fiend or wingbearer races. As such, these two races and others like them came to be known as exemplary examples of what it meant to be a demon. There was only one problem. Both fiends and wingbearers advocated that might made right. Both tribes believed that it was the strong that should rule. And because they were considered prime examples, many other tribes started to follow their lead; it didn’t take long for the vast majority of demons to become bonafide meatheads.That said, there was obviously no way that every single member of every single demonic race was focused entirely on becoming more powerful. There were non-combatants amongst them. Case in point: Leila. Our resident demon girl was more or less the exact opposite of a musclebrain. Though she’s a bit of a weirdo, so it might actually just be her. Oh yeah, speaking of Leila…The sheep-horned demon had told me a fair amount about the current state of the world. According to her, demonkind’s current leaders no longer believed that they would be able to defeat the humans alone. They had recently put the differences between themselves, the beastkin, and the demi-humans aside and started collaborating in an effort to surmount the human threat as a joint force. Moreover, there had been an effort to gather up the more intelligent demons in order to create a better roadmap for the future. That last bit alone already gave way to the fact that there were in fact differences between races and the members thereof. I wonder what a country run by demons is like. I should probably pay it a visit sometime.I continued to chase the man while contemplating thought after thought. A bit of time passed, and we eventually reached the capital city’s centrepiece, the castle that I’d been gazing upon from afar ever since I first initiated this wild goose chase.It was a splendid structure, made of pure white stone. It was polished, gaudy, and basically everything you’d expect from a neat little castle. But that was all it amounted to. Heh. Mine’s way better.I sat relishing in a sense of superiority, but not for long. Bunny boy had finally stopped bouncing from roof to roof. He had reached his destination. After leaping off a building and falling back to the ground, he looped around the castle and entered not through its front gate, but rather, a rear entrance that was situated along one of its outer ramparts.The single soldier standing guard prompted him for his ID, which he pulled from within his hooded cloak. He then began moving again, and this time, headed towards a door leading inside the castle.I continued tailing him. I carefully leapt over the wall while making sure to make as little noise as possible before moving towards the door. To be frank, I was a little tense, so I took a deep breath to calm my nerves, and reached for the doorknob.Only to find that it didn’t turn.There was a bit of a rattling sound, but that was it. The doorknob didn’t budge, and the door didn’t open. It was locked. Shit. I should’ve seen this coming. Of course people lock doors behind them. Why wouldn’t they?And though my actions should have alerted the man and informed him something was wrong, it turned out that I was lucky.“Who’s there?” Because, although he had appeared suspicious, the man simply opened the door and stuck his head out its entrance. He seemed to think that I was the guard, and that I had business with him, but he was wrong.The first thing I did as I saw his face was twist my body and deliver the day’s third roundhouse kick. He groaned a bit as his head was smashed against the wall before collapsing onto the door and widening the opening. But that was it. He didn’t manage to react quickly enough to make any noise.I immediately slipped into the doorway, confirmed that there wasn’t anyone else around, dragged the unconscious peeping tom inside, and shut the door.“Holy shit.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “That was close.”I tried to make my break-in as stealthy as I could. I tried not to make any noise, and I tried not to get spotted. The idea was to be as stealthy as a snake in the grass, to keep things as easy as possible by preventing my foes from sounding the alarm. The less they suspected, the less on guard they would be. And the less on guard they were, the easier it would be for me to take control of the situation.But evidently, I didn’t quite have all the skills I needed to pull it off. I didn’t even realize that I should have checked to see if the door was locked. I was an amateur attempting something that one should never try at home, something meant only for highly trained professionals.And unlike a certain snakey dude with a beard, I wasn’t a member of the special forces. And I couldn’t just become him. Things just weren’t going to be that easy. Speaking of good old snake and ‘stache, he’s boss as fuck. He can go undetected standing in plain sight, and the genome soldiers almost never see him even when he’s right next to them. I now understood that completing a mission without ever being revealed was difficult, and that he could only ever do it because he was special. Amateurs like me were sure to be caught in a matter of minutes. Yeah. That’s right. This isn’t an excuse at all. He’s just totes OP. Probably had a ridiculously high-level Stealth skill or something. [1]“Alright, what next?”I raised a hand to my chin as I considered my options. I had already completed all my initial objectives just by successfully making it into the building. Though I did have some overarching goals, I hadn’t bothered formulating a detailed plan on my way here. Such is the spirit of laissez-faire.While I would have loved to continue without a plan, I knew that it wasn’t a good idea, so I reviewed my objectives. The first was to murder the fuck out of Prince Douchebag. The second was to restore the old king to his rightful place on the throne.With my objectives and the things the knights had mentioned yesterday in mind, I realized that saving the king was probably the more important of the two. I wanted a bit of one on one time, and I needed to make sure that I got to him before he was killed. The moment he died would be the moment the prince’s faction gained legitimacy, spelling an end to the whole operation. Wait. Why haven’t they killed him anyway? If I was rooting for the prince, then snuffing out the old geezer the throne used to belong to would probably be the first thing on my list. He’s basically the opposing faction’s leader. His rescue would put me and my bros in some deep shit. So why haven’t they just done it? Are they planning to execute him in public for the sake of propaganda or something?I caught myself considering something inconsequential, so I shrugged it off and focused on my objective. I needed to save the king. Urgently. I think they said they had him locked up underground?“Now, if I was making a castle, where would I put my underground dungeon…?” I scanned my surroundings as I muttered, only to realize that I was in a passageway. There was nothing in front of me but a single door.I didn’t have the liberty to interrogate the guy I knocked out. He had the whole douchey spy aesthetic going for him. It was obvious that he was tight-lipped; he wasn’t going to crack so easily. I didn’t exactly have all that much knowledge of torture. There was a pretty good chance I’d accidentally kill him if I tried. And because I wasn’t all that keen on gore, I was more likely to damage myself than extract any meaningful information.There wasn’t much of a choice for me to do anything but proceed as is. I would stay stealthed and wander around the castle in order to fill the map. Guess I’ll set up a few Evil Eyes while I’m at it.As they were quite expensive, I only had a few that could operate outside the dungeon’s bounds. But at least it’s better than nothing.My next course of action in mind, I walked across the hall and reached for yet another doorknob.***TL Note [1] Metal Gear references, a dime a dozen.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Yup, yet another fast chapter coming out thanks to all of Boss Young’un’s hard work. He’s lookin’ for a job, keeping his skills brushed up, playing loads of games, and still has time to crank these chapters out. I dunno if I could do it. It truly is a labor of love for him. My mom’s birthday was the other day, so naturally I spent it playing DnD with a couple of friends. Started up a 5e game and they all seemed to like it, so I’m glad. But don’t worry. We went out to eat the day after to celebrate, because the restaurant she wanted to go to was closed. It was pretty good food too, so I was happy. All right, letter sack, letter sack… Ah, here it is. Looks like we got three letters today, so a big thank you goes out to Zaow (@Zaowchen), madcart, and Zehd Cashew. Remember, if you’ve got a question you’d like me to ask, post it in the comments and I’ll reply. Get noticed by your senpai today! See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

An Exploration of the Castle’s Interior
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerThe door I reached towards creaked as it opened. Unlike the last door, it wasn’t locked. But it was guarded.“Huh? What was tha—” One of the soldiers stationed on the other side narrowed his eyes and stared at the room’s entrance. His suspicions were roused. Doors didn’t just open by themselves after all. He closed in and began to inspect his surroundings, so I used my hand to chop him in the back of the neck and knocked him out cold.
“T-the hell?” His partner looked at him wide-eyed. And like the first soldier, the second also began to approach while bearing an air of suspicion. “Are you alri—”I knew that the guard would soon collapse, so I presented him a get-well gift in the form of a kick to the face. Lo and behold, the prophecy came true and guard number two collapsed in the exact same way as guard number one.His armour clattered as it hit the floor, but fortunately, the noise went unnoticed. No more guards came to check the situation out. And none sounded the alarm either. And no witnesses. You see, this is what we call perfect stealth.The technique I was applying was clearly one I had “inherited” from an ancient clan of martial artists specialized in espionage. I dubbed it Active Stealth. It was impossible for me to be detected if there wasn’t anyone to detect me, after all. 1, 2 and… Poof! Yuki has learned Active Stealth. [1]One would normally suspect that a skill like Stealth would allow me to just skip the step known as taking out my enemies. And anyone that held a suspicion would be correct if the skill was perfect. Alas, it wasn’t. Moving around, for one, obviously led to a decrease in my ability to remain unseen, but it wasn’t the only way for me to be detected. Stealth didn’t work as well on those that stared at an area for a long time while bearing suspicion. Nor did it work all that well on those that could sense disruptions in the flow of mana.While increasing the skill’s level did also increase its efficacy, no number of levels would allow it to render me undetectable. Anyone as powerful as Lefi would be able to see me right away even if I had it maxed.Soldier number one had fulfilled the condition related to suspicion. He likely would have seen through the skill had I just let him be, hence why I had eliminated him.And so, time passed. I continued moving through the castle while using my active stealth techniques in order to “sneak past” any soldiers I couldn’t otherwise avoid. My evil eyes looked around the place while I wandered around, so it didn’t actually take all that long for me to get the map nice and fleshed out. The castle’s insides were basically scantily exposed before me.But I couldn’t quite seem to find the one thing I was looking for. The castle’s dungeon was nowhere to be found. Such was simply how things were. My map was an extremely useful tool, but like all tools, it had its limitations. It would only show that of which I had seen. I couldn’t see anything on the other side of a door I had yet to open. Enemies in areas of the map that were still dark remained undetected, and hidden passageways simply didn’t show up. I had to identify the secret door or whatever with my own two eyes if I wanted the map to show it. I suspected that I would most likely eventually gain the game-like ability to automatically generate the map of an area I entered without having to look upon it, but that was something that would have to wait until the dungeon gained a few more levels. It very well could happen in the future. But that’s the future. No point in thinking about what may or may not even happen.The castle seemed to have been built under the assumption that it would one day be subject to an enemy attack. Its interior was convoluted and a lot more difficult to navigate than it otherwise could have been. Moreover, it also seemed to bear some sort of enchantment. I would always end up right back where I started whenever I took my eyes off the map and just allowed myself to wander.One of the dungeon’s resident wraith girls, Lowe, was capable of more or less doing the same thing. Which means that it’s probably some sort of mind magic. Isn’t this like, ridiculously inconvenient? How the hell are you actually supposed to work, let alone live here? Wait a second. What if they’ve got items that make them immune to the spell’s effects? That actually doesn’t seem all that far fetched, seeing as how this is the king’s castle and whatnot. Dude literally rules an entire country. I’m sure he’s got the resources he needs to do it.I visited the nearest corpse and started to analyze its belongings. While I had called it a corpse, the soldier wasn’t actually dead. None of them were. I hadn’t bothered killing anyone just yet.Bingo. I found the item I was looking for after rummaging through one of the soldiers’ inner pockets. It was a thin, flat card, one with both the soldier’s name and rank carved into it. Analyzing it revealed that it was an enchanted item called a Mark of Authorization. Anyone that held it would be immune to the effects of spells affecting one’s ability to navigate a prespecified area. It was a rather high-quality item as far as mass-produced goods went. Analyze had given it a B-.I had to admit, the item was quite well designed. The pseudo dog tag functioned as both a piece of ID and a tool that allowed the soldier to move around the castle. Welp. This is mine now, I guess. Thanks bro.Having taken what I needed, I stopped looting the “corpse” and stood up.And then, it happened.There was a click. One of the maids had opened a door and entered the room. The first thing she did was look right at me.There was a moment of silence. And then, my head was filled with noise. A song had begun playing, a piece of BGM that indicated that two trainers’ eyes had met. Only then did I realize the problem. My stealth skill had worn off while I was looting the soldier’s “corpse,” and I had forgotten to recast it. [2]The maid broke eye contact. She slowly looked down and saw the soldier collapsed at my feet. The servant then slowly looked back up while taking a deep breath. She was about to scream.“Wait! Hold on!” I ran up to her and placed a hand on her face, sealing her mouth shut before she could make a noise. “Alright, listen. Just calm down. Don’t make a big deal out of this, and nothing will happen. We clear?”Her face paled. The maid had interpreted my words as a threat to her life, so she nodded in compliance. I waited a bit for her to calm down, then slowly removed my hand from her lips.“I-Is he dead?” She spoke in a soft, quivering voice with her gaze still on the soldier.
“Nah. He’s out cold, but he’s fine,” I said. “See how he’s still breathing?”The truth of the matter was that I had hit the guard a little bit too hard. So hard, in fact, that he looked more dead than alive. It wasn’t something that a mere glance or two would tell you. The maid, however, seemed convinced. Her shoulders, which had tensed up the moment she saw me, finally slackened.“This castle might just turn into something along the lines of a battlefield, so you might want to grab all your maid friends and get the hell outta here while you still can.”
“D-Does that mean you’re here to save His Majesty and his venerable daughter?” The maid’s eyes filled with hope.
“His wha—er, yeah. Sure.” I managed to catch myself before I slipped up too badly, and responded to the maid with a nod. The king’s got a daughter? And they’ve got her in custody too? The fuck?
“Please, please save them!” the maid took my hands in hers and looked at me with an earnest, serious gaze.
“Uhhh, a-alright. Sure.”
“The dungeon is just out that door,” said the maid. “I wish you fortune and pray that God shall grant you His protection and bless you with victory…”***The combination of the maid’s instructions and the item I had looted off the soldier allowed me to find the dungeon with ease. Speaking of the item, holding it made me feel a sort of strange sensation. It was almost like my field of view had suddenly expanded, which meant that the spell was likely one that impeded the brain’s ability to process one’s surroundings. In the long run, however, the item proved more consequential than not. The reason I couldn’t find the dungeon wasn’t because the spell was messing with my mind. It was because the dungeon had never been inside the castle to begin with. The entrance was situated outside. No amount of searching would have led me to it because I had been looking in the wrong place.There were two soldiers standing by its entrance, so I “stealthed” them away. My execution was on point. I had completed the perfect assassination, save for the fact that I hadn’t actually killed either of them.I opened the map and checked up on the maid before I entered. Thankfully, she had heeded my advice instead of reporting me to her superiors; she and her coworkers had already evacuated.After glancing at the soldiers one last time and confirming that they were indeed unconscious, I began to push on the dungeon’s entrance. The rusted door creaked as it opened, revealing a set of stone stairs that led underground. The air was nice and chilly, as one would expect. But the sour scent that filled it ruined it. I couldn’t help but scrounge up my nose in discomfort.I made my way down while ensuring that my footsteps remained as silent as possible. Soon, I began hearing things. There were two types of noises. The first was a dull striking sound, one that repeated over and over. The second was a stifled scream, and it would always follow immediately after each dull thwack.And as I got even closer, I started to make out voices.“P-Please… stop…”
“Heh heh heh. Sorry little lady, but I can’t. Your dear father, the king, is being a tad bit too stubborn, you see. If you’ve really gotta blame someone, then it’ll have to be him and his tight lips. Now take this!”The first thing I saw upon finally reaching the bottom step was a man, a man beating a half-naked little girl with his fists. His breathing was ragged, and a single glance at the lower half of his body was enough to inform me that he was getting off, that he was enjoying himself.“Cease that immediately, you knave!”Another man lay in the cell across from the one the perverted scumbag was currently occupying. He was a rather well-aged individual, and he even had a cane to assist him in walking around. Dirt was smeared all over his clothes. They were tattered, but I could tell that they had started off as something of a more expensive make. The scene before him had him enraged. He glared at the pervert with a hate-fueled fury as he clenched his gums hard enough for them to seep blood.All the excitement I had felt immediately melted away. In a single instant, my mood had plummeted to rock bottom. Seeing the horny gorilla had filled my mind with but a single thought. I’m going to fucking kill that son of a bitch.I set into motion without any further delay. I crept up behind the perverted sadist, drew the dagger I had hidden away in one of my pockets, and struck him from behind. My strike was true. It went straight through his back and pierced his heart.“Go live out your fantasies in hell, pervert.” I twisted the blade, sealing his fate as I pulled it from his back.Only then did his monkey brain finally process what had happened. The ecstasy on his face was replaced with horror as his blood violently gushed up his throat and spilled from his lips. With no more strength in his legs, he collapsed. He was dead.I didn’t bother checking his pulse. Instead, I just kicked him out of the way and approached the little girl, who had curled herself into a ball in order to protect herself from harm. I immediately opened my inventory, reached into the spatial distortion it created, and procured a high-grade potion. Carefully, I poured its contents over the countless injuries that had been inflicted upon her. God fucking damn it. I swear, if I run into one more piece of fucking trash…“Are you… a hero…?” While the girl had recoiled with fear at first, she soon realized that I didn’t intend to hurt her. Her frightened gaze transformed into one of trust, one that thought of me as a source of salvation.
“…Yeah.” I hesitated but ultimately chose not to deny her. “Everything will be okay now. No one’s going to hurt you anymore.”I pat the girl on the head as I spoke. Her expression changed again, this time transforming into one of heartfelt relief. And then, unable to endure any longer, she passed out.“W-who are you…?” The man in the cell across from the girl’s asked in a bewildered tone. While he seemed relieved that I had saved the girl that was most likely his daughter, he wasn’t totally relaxed. He clearly wanted a better grasp on the situation.I took a blanket out from my inventory, put it on top of the half-naked little girl and heaved a sigh before finally turning towards the man in the other cell.“What’s up, king?”I grinned from underneath my mask as I started to speak to the country’s ruler.***TL Notes

In the Dungeon
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerAnalyzing the man had confirmed that he was indeed the king I was looking for. Of course, I hadn’t the need to. His identity was fairly obvious given the circumstances, but I had done so just for confirmation.“Who am I?” I glanced at the girl and confirmed that she was still asleep before making my next move. “Well, I suppose this might help you understand.”I materialized my wings and showed them to the king in order to express my identity.“So you are are a demon? I see. So you plan to use the chaos wrought by this situation to slay me?” The king smiled in a self-deprecating manner. “I am afraid that all your effort has gone to waste. Nothing will come of my death.”
“I know there’s no point in killing you. I wasn’t really planning on it in the first place. Hell, if I wanted to kill you, I would’ve already done it,” I said. “I’m actually here to do the opposite. I’m here to save you, so you better be grateful, y’hear?”
“A demon… wishes to save me?”
“Well, I am certainly a demon, yeah, but I’m not here on anyone’s orders. I’d probably be the guy giving orders instead. I’m not just a demon, king. I’m a demon lord, a demon lord that happens to live in the Wicked Forest.”
“I see. So you are the one responsible for the Alfyro incident…” The man’s eyes sharpened and his eyes began to glint. His expression revealed that, though he was all banged up, he was still a king, a man of a high enough calibre to stand at the top of a country. “But that only confuses me all the more. If that were truly you, then why would you be here, of all places?”My response was to shrug in an exaggerated manner. “Hey, don’t make it sound like I’m here ‘cause I wanna be,” I said. “You see, the problem is that there’s been an influx of dumb humans trespassing on my property lately. I managed to find out that the ring leader responsible for it all is this country’s prince, so I happened to decide to pay him a visit and put the poor retarded thing down. So you know, I show up and find out that the whole thing’s gone to shit.”
“That does seem rather unfortunate.” The king chuckled in amusement before quickly turning sombre. “So that idiotic excuse of a son of mine truly did attempt to lay claim to the Wicked Forest.”
“Yeah, he did. Come on man, you’ve really gotta start keeping a better eye on your kids. Anyway, long story short, I’d prefer if Prince Douchebag kept his grubby little hands off this country’s throne. Dealing with all the soldier’s he’ll send my way is gonna be one helluva chore,” I said. “So here’s the deal. I’ll help you out of here if you agree to rein in the idiots that want to invade my lands.”
“So that was your purpose… I now understand why you have appeared before me, but I doubt that I will be able to do as you say.”The king backed away from his cell’s bars, sat down, and leaned against one of the walls. He seemed tired, exhausted even. His majestic aura had all but vanished.“I am but a foolish ruler, an incompetent king. I had known that my son was up to something. I found his actions suspicious, but I was unable to act out against them.” The king spoke in a self-loathing tone of voice. “Do you truly believe that a dullard such as myself could truly maintain control of an entire country?”
“Well man, you’re going to have to. ‘Cause if you don’t, then I’ll end up killing more of your countrymen than you can count. That stupid son of yours wants my land, but I’m not about to just hand it over on a silver platter. I like my peace, king, and he’s threatening it. That’s why I’m going to kill him and everyone he sends at me without a moment’s hesitation.”
“…So you are saying that I should stop grumbling about my own weakness and simply get to work?”
“Basically, yeah. Oh and just putting this out there, the people that live in this city seem to want to see you reinstated. In fact, the church and their happy little friends were planning to storm the castle tonight. Just to save you.”
“The church? Really now?”The king narrowed his eyes in suspicion.“Hey, don’t ask me. All I know is that they mentioned something about being at odds with the prince’s faction, and standing to lose lots if it managed to come into power. Hence the rescue op,” I said. “So it doesn’t really matter whether you were planning out your retirement or whatever. The dam has already been broken, king, and there are few capable of truly stopping the flood.”
“I see…” the king muttered as if amused. “I suppose it is a parent’s duty to atone for their child’s sins.”He seemed to hesitate for a moment before heaving a long, heavy sigh. He then got to his feet and turned to face me. All the exhaustion on his face had vanished, gone with the wind as if it had never been to begin with. His eyes shone with a powerful, majestic light.“Very well. I agree to your terms. Please assist in removing me from this prison.”
“Perfect.” I smirked. “Oh, but fair warning. If you ever antagonize me, then I’ll kill you and everyone else that took part in your plans without fail. I’m sure you wouldn’t want this poor little daughter of yours sobbing all over the grave you dug for yourself now, would you?”For some odd reason, the king responded to my threat with a smile.“What?”
“I believe that the average threat in such a scenario would be that you would slay my daughter.”I didn’t respond. I couldn’t see my own face—nor could the king given my mask, but I was sure that the expression on my face looked fairly similar to that of a shocked Pikachu.“I can’t say that I ever expected my daughter’s hero to be a demon lord. What an interesting turn of events.” The king smiled. “Ah, right. There is one thing that I must say.”
“What now?” I groaned.The king bowed. He bowed as deeply as his old back would allow.“I thank you for rescuing my daughter.” The dignified, kingly mask he wore was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it had been replaced by an expression that could only ever belong to a loving father.
“Pft. It was nothing. The perverted prick abusing her just happened to catch my eye and tick me off. That’s all there was to it,” I scoffed. “Anyway, let’s get the hell outta here. Reinforcements will be here soon, so we really should hurry the hell up.”I grabbed the cell’s bars and wrenched them open, creating a space large enough for the king to pass through. My hearing, which had been enhanced by sheer virtue of the fact that I was a demon lord, had picked up on a faint clattering coming from up above. Sounds like they must’ve found one of the soldiers I KO’d.My cover was blown. But I didn’t particularly mind. The king and his daughter were safe. I no longer ran the risk of them being offed just ‘cause I’d been detected. Sweet. Looks like I’ll finally get a chance to blow off all the stress I’ve been building up lately.A wide grin appeared on my face as I drew Zaien from within my inventory. I could feel the sword respond with glee. Man Zaien, you sure do love work. Them be some corporate slave vibes you’re giving off right there.Wait a second. That’s not it at all. You’re just happy you get to make people bleed, aren’t you? God damn it. Wasn’t getting rid of the curse supposed to fix that damned personality of yours? After further consideration, I realized that while the blade still did drain the blood of those it injured, it at least no longer afflicted them with a curse. That is at least a step up, right? Yeah. Let’s just go with that.On a completely unrelated note, the mask I was currently wearing was the full faced one as opposed to the one with a hole around the mouth. I had swapped it out right before I first entered the castle. Iunno why, but I just like this one more.“You good enough to walk?”
“I am.”
“Then carry your daughter. I’ll make you a nice clear path.”The king exited his cell through the hole I made, ran over to his daughter, and lifted her in up in his arms.“All her injuries have vanished!” He exclaimed. “Was the potion you gave her an elixir?”
“An elixir? Nah, it was just a regular high-grade potion.”
“Is that not precisely what an elixir is? I know not if this city has another in circulation. However, I will ensure that I pay you back in kind. And again, I truly thank you for using an item of such value on my daughter.”Wait. Seriously? High-grade potions were that valuable? I had always assumed that they weren’t anything all that special. The combination of their name and the fact that Lefi had casually suggested that everyone should have a few in reserve had led me to assume that they weren’t all that special. I had assumed that most combatants had one or two in stock, as per the dragon girl’s suggestion. Thinking about its ridiculously powerful effects, however, soon caused me to accept that I was in the wrong. I mean, it works. And there’s nothing wrong with things that work, even if they are a taaaaaad bit expensive. Right? Okay yeah, no. Who am I kidding? I should probably be a bit more careful about using these things outside the Wicked Forest from now on.I smiled awkwardly to myself before heading up to the surface and all its commotion, the king and his daughter in tow.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, how about another double release, huh? Boss Young’un is workin’ his tail off, I tell you what. Try not to get TOO used to it though. Once he gets a job, I’m sure the amount of releases will drop off again. Don’t mean to ruin any dream, just trying to be realistic. Also, when we do have a double release, I’ll only put my note on the latest chapter. I tend to run dry of material if I try and do two, so that’s why. All right, we got two letters today, so thanks to zekkendo and Tonatsi. zekkendo in particular, since he mentioned that he’s been curious about DnD, so I’m putting out an invitation to anyone who might want to join in on a game on the website Roll20.net. I’m still pretty new to it myself, but I do play in a game weekly on Mondays, but have found myself wanting to play more. So if you’re interested, DM me on Discord @PhantomThiefJoker#4845 and I’ll try and get it all set up. If you’ve got a question you’d like to ask, leave it below and I’ll answer.

A Battle Within a Castle — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Hah hah hah! Come at me! Come at me and get your asses beat like the weak little shits you are!” I laughed in an overly exaggerated manner as I incapacitated with overwhelming force any soldier that dared face me—or at least that was what I had envisioned happening. Reality was a bit different for… reasons. The soldiers were behaving in a bit of an odd manner.There were a lot of them. My guess had most likely been on point. Although I didn’t have any evidence to back it, the response we were faced with suggested that someone had finally found one of the many soldiers that I had used active stealth to “avoid.” The king and I had been subject to a constant onslaught ever since the moment we first stepped foot out of the dungeon. Soldiers were coming our way in an endless stream and attempting to encircle us at every given opportunity.That part was normal. And if the soldiers had actually attempted to truly engage us, then everything that followed would also have been normal.But most hadn’t.“Graaaaaaahhhh! I’m dying! I’m totally dying!”
“Oh the pain! Medic! Medic! I need healing!”Every soldier around me had been blown away each time I swung my weapon… regardless of whether or not I had actually hit them. Simply put, they were acting. They had leapt away in a “realistic” manner and feigned injury immediately afterwards in order to avoid conflict.And each time I looked at the men, they would return my gaze with a nod, a knowing expression of acknowledgement. Because although they couldn’t disobey their orders, they too fought for the king. It was evident that many of the soldiers present did not wish to rebel, that they were not fighting for the prince’s faction of their own will. Welp. Now I feel kinda bad about “avoiding” everyone. Sorry guys. The pieces of shit I met in town made me assume you were all hostile douchebags. I’ll make it up to you later by treating you to a good chunk of meat.“Well, you seem rather liked.”
“…It appears so.”The king nodded, but only after doing a bit of inner reflection. The “battle” unfolding before him seemed to have prompted a thought.It didn’t take long for me to become a willing participant in the soldiers’ farce. That was why I had started laughing the way I had. I was doing my best to hold back too. I was using the back of Zaien’s blade and only swinging it with a fifth of my usual strength, just in case. I didn’t want to actually injure any of my allies, after all.“What are you imbeciles doing!?” Seeing his subordinates fall like pins had caused one of the men in charge to grow impatient. He began yelling at them while brandishing his sword in a manner that clearly conveyed his annoyance. “Stop fooling around and capture them already!”Unlike his subordinates, the commander clearly had a foot in the prince’s camp. Guess I’m doing him in. I kicked off the ground. I took a single step that spanned the entire distance between the commander and I.“And hurry it uraaaagh?!” He tried to complain some more, but it soon devolved into incoherent screaming. I used the arm not holding my blade to drill a fist into his solar plexus the moment he opened his mouth.There was a loud crack. The strike not only completely destroyed his armour, but also sent him flying into the building to his rear. The way he stuck to the wall and then slowly peeled off of it afterwards was almost comical in nature.“Oh no!!” One of the knights immediately took advantage of the change in the situation. “He took out the captain! Retreat, men! We’re no match for him! Get the hell out of here!”The knight’s shout sounded so happy it almost came off as celebratory. He and his buddies immediately began to fake a desperate retreat, one that emulated what would likely only ever be seen on the most grievous of battlefields. For some odd reason, even the soldiers that should have been completely uninjured started to limp away. Some borrowed each other’s shoulders, while others dragged their “heavily wounded” by grabbing them under the armpits and slowly hauling them off the battlefield.I couldn’t help but smile awkwardly as I watched them act. There simply wasn’t any other way I could respond. Oh wait. Details, Yuki, details. How could you forget?“Well, hate to break it to you soldier, but it looks like you’ve been captured by the enemy.” I moved over to one of the limping men and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Clearly, this means you’ve become a good old prisoner of war.”
“Sir, yes sir. I’ve been caught by enemy forces, and therefore it’s only natural that I am classified as POW. The enemy’s been interrogating me, so it isn’t my fault if I spill any important military information.”Fortunately, the guy I caught was quick on his feet. He immediately got where I was going and answered in a way that indicated he was totally on board.“So first thing’s first, where exactly is that shithead of a prince holed up?”
“His Highness is probably either in his study or the audience hall. I’m not sure exactly which of the two he’s in right at this moment, but it should be one or the other.”
“Alright. What about the soldiers loyal to him? Where are they located?”
“Most of them are probably in town dealing with the riot that’s broken out just outside the castle grounds. There are a few left inside, but we’ll have them pinned down for you, so you shouldn’t need to worry about them at all.”
“Wait? There’s a riot? Mind explaining that whole situation?”
“The church seems to have riled up the citizens and caused a huge mess. We’ve always been at odds with His Highness’ faction, so they had us stay inside the castle to prevent us from joining the rebel side and putting His Highness’ soldiers in a bad spot,” he said. “But thanks to you, we’ve finally found ourselves able to take action. And for that, we thank you, every last one of us.”
“Naw, don’t worry about it. I’m just, you know, also doing mission things,” I said. “I just did what I had to. That’s all.”I began thinking about the riot as I spoke. Did they decide to push up the schedule because of that whole orphanage thing? Yeah, that sounds about right. Carlotta probably realized that they’d lose the initiative if they waited, so she probably used that whole incident to drive the citizens into a frenzy.Wait. Isn’t she supposed to be a paladin? I’m pretty sure causing a riot and manipulating the citizens into becoming a distraction is just about as un-knightly as you can get. And that’s ignoring the whole expectation where holy knights are supposed to be even more strict with the rules and whatnot.Oh well, whatever. Given the circumstances, I doubted it’d be that long before I met up with the rescue squad. Soon, I’ll be able to just hand them the king and go smash the prince’s face in.I didn’t have the time to casually escort the old man to safety and come back. There was a chance that the prince would run if we took too long. And I didn’t want him getting away.“Sweet, that just about fills me in on everything I wanted to know,” I said. “So uh, I’ll make sure to get the ki—His Majesty somewhere safe. You guys should probably get going too. Don’t push yourselves too hard though.”
“Sir, yes sir! The same goes to you, and we wish you the best of luck!”The “prisoner of war” saluted me, bowed to the king, and went back to retreating alongside his buddies. Once he was gone, I turned back around to face the old man. “Right, king dude. The actual rescue squad should be here soon. You should probably get ready to take your daughter and have them escort you guys to safety.”“…There is one thing I would like to ask you.”
“What?”
“Do you intend on… ending my son’s life?”
“Yeah. I do.”
“I see…”The king responded to my nod by closing his eyes. He waited a few moments before finally slowly opening them again. The look on his face seemed to indicate that he had come to some sort of decision.“I would like to be allowed to accompany you.”
“Look man, I’m sorry, but it doesn’t matter whether or not you tag along. Your son’s life is going to end. And I’ll be the one to do it. Nothing you say is going to change my mind. Not now, not ever.”It simply couldn’t be helped. The prince’s very presence was a threat to my peace.“My son has committed high treason. His demise is inevitable. He will be put to death even if you do not choose to slay him. The inevitability, however, is precisely why I wish to oversee his final moments.”His words caused me to pause for a moment. I couldn’t deny his thoughts. Because I understood that that was just what it meant to be a parent.“Just don’t get in my way, alright?”
“I swear that I will not.”The only response I could offer the stubborn old king was a sigh.<– Prev — Next –>

A Battle Within a Castle — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixThe first thing the king and I did after our little conversation about murdering his son was to move. We needed to get the little princess somewhere safe. Since we knew that our allies would be somewhere in front, we cut through the castle’s interior and headed out front. Lo and behold, the rescue squad was right there waiting for us. Their pace was so brisk that watching them was almost a bit fascinating.“Your Majesty! You’re safe!” Carlotta, who was at the squad’s front, hailed the king the moment she saw him before turning towards me with a bit of a suspicious look. “You were the one who rescued him, I take it…?”Carlotta was this operation’s supreme commander. Yet, I had somehow expected her to be here. She just seemed like the type that would take to the front lines and order the soldiers to follow her as she charged into the fray. And she wasn’t the only familiar face either.“Oh, hey Nell. Fancy seeing you around these parts.”
“Wait, Yu-Why are you here!?” asked Nell.The hero’s presence confirmed that the church did indeed view her as an important asset. There was no way they would have deployed her on such an important mission had they felt otherwise.“Explaining it all would be a huge pain in the ass, so I’mma just not.”Nell looked like she was about to complain, but her boss cut her off before she could.“Cease, Nell. I too want to ask him many, many things, but this is not the time for that. We are before his majesty, and we don’t want to waste his time. Save any questions you have for later.” The knight took a knee as she lectured her subordinate. Soon, her whole unit followed suit. “Your Majesty, we are glad to see both you and your daughter in good health. Nothing could possibly mean more to us than your safety.”
“Enough,” said the king. “Raise your heads. There is no need for you to go through with pleasantries. This is in an emergency, and I see it only rational that we act in a manner befitting of such.”
“Understood, Your Majesty.”Carlotta got to her feet and turned to her unit to instruct them to do the same. I used her momentary bit of inattention to whisper into the king’s ears.“I know these guys, and they know me. But they don’t know what I really am, so don’t be giving me away.”The king gave the slightest nod possible. He too was being all sneaky-like.I hadn’t told the stubborn old coot the whole truth. Nell knew my identity, but I figured that it’d be better for me not to tell him that.“Given the circumstances, Your Majesty, might I suggest evacuating immediately? A part of this unit will accompany you and ensure that you make it to safety.”
“Please evacuate only my daughter,” said the king, resolutely. “I am afraid that I must remain.”
“Sir..?” Carlotta made a stupefied expression, as if she hadn’t ever expected that she would be denied.
“It is my understanding that you will soon make your way towards my idiotic excuse of a son. I shall join you in seeing to his demise.”
“B-But Your Majesty…” Carlotta gave a troubled frown. She simply didn’t know how else to react to the king’s unexpected suggestion.
“I understand that I am asking for a significant favour. But I insist. You must escort me to his side.”And him being a stubborn old coot probably isn’t helping either.Their conversation soon came to an unexpected, abrupt end. My skills started blaring alarms through my head. An enemy had come and a crisis was upon us. The strength of Crisis Detection’s response changed based on the severity of the threat. For example, Illuna loved to start hitting me when she started to get angry. She would pound the bottom of her fists into my chest. It was obviously an attack, but the skill judged it so inconsequential that it was completely ignored. However, the skill would begin blaring off alarms the moment Lefi attempted the same adorable thing. It would instill an overwhelming sense of crisis throughout every fibre of my being.The sensation I was currently feeling was nowhere close to the threat of an angry Lefi, but it was still enough of a threat to cause the skill to pop. Based on what I’d experienced within the Wicked Forest, such a sensation meant that the attack being launched my way was one that would cause significant harm if I didn’t react immediately. And as such, I took an action that could almost be called reflexive. I raised the blade I had been resting atop my shoulders and held it above my head in order to block the incoming attack.A loud clang pierced my ears and a dull shock ran through my arms. The attack was a heavy one. In fact, it was so heavy that I couldn’t help but think that the attacker had jumped off the castle in order to give his first strike a bit of oomph.“You actually blocked that? Not bad! Not bad at all!”I turned around to see my attacker, a burly man with his weapon drawn and ready to go. The look on his face was… wrong. He was just so happy and enraptured that I couldn’t help but feel a sense of danger. For my chastity.“Aw hell no! You stay the fuck outta my ass!”I almost stumbled across my own words as I turned around and attempted to strike him with a roundhouse kick. But unlike everyone else I’d fought today, he managed to dodge it and take up a stance with his blade. Again, I was assaulted by an instinctive repulsion.He was a pervert.I could just tell.“Hahaha!” The man laughed. “I only took this shitty job because I heard I’d get a chance to fight the church’s famous lady knight, or even the hero herself. But would you look here! I’ve got myself something even better! What a lucky day it is! If I knew someone like you was coming, then I would’ve gotten myself off my ass even earlier!”The man grinned as widely as any human being possibly could while his eyes began to glow with a sharp glint. Gross. That’s fucking gross. God help me. This motherfucker’s one of them freaks obsessed with fighting. And one of the really messed up ones at that.His equips were indicative of the fact that he was your everyday soldier. I would have been quite happy if it had turned out that he was basically wearing rags, but unfortunately, it was the opposite. Analyze informed me that his gear was much better than anything a mere member of the rank and file could ever afford. He said something about a job, right? I guess that would probably make him either a merc or an adventurer.The rude pervert’s entrance caused the king and the knights to tense up.“A-Are you okay!?” asked Nell in a panicked tone.
“I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. Just go do what you gotta do.”The war-crazed pervert seemed to have judged me as a worthy foe or something. He was no longer even considering anyone else. They’d all left his focus. His sword was directed at me and only me. He was unlikely to chase the king and his knights so long as I remained. Ughhhhhhhhhhh. God damn it. Give me a break. Look man, I’m a pacifist. Sure, I fight stuff, but only because it’s absolutely necessary. I only do what I have to, nothing more. ‘Cause unlike this degenerate, I don’t actually like almost getting myself killed.A member of the rescue team attempted to attack the man. He moved in a ninja-like manner, approached the pervert from behind, and attempted to hit one of his blind spots.But it didn’t work.“Get out of here, small fry. This party’s exclusive. Invite only.”There was a flash. The ally that had attacked was split right in half. His death prompted Carlotta to click her tongue in annoyance. “Are you going to need backup?”“Nah, I’m good. If anything, you guys will just get in my way.”If I had to describe Zaien in a single word, I would deem the blade massive. Its effective range was far too large for me to want to bother accounting for any allies that may or may not be in the way. It wasn’t impossible, but I just didn’t want to bother. I wasn’t all that great at swordplay. Chances were, I would mess up and accidentally cleave right through anyone that moved to support me.“Olga! Duo!”
“What is it, ma’am?”
“The two of you take the king’s daughter and withdraw immediately. The rest of you, to me. We’ll be escorting His Majesty.”
“Yes, ma’am!”
“Your Majesty, please try your best not to stray from our sides.”
“Of course,” said the king.
“I’ll leave you to take care of him, Wye, but don’t die,” said the knight. “I still have many things to ask you.”
“B-Be careful!” added Nell.
“Yeah, yeah, I got it. Hurry up and go already.” I kept my eyes in front and trained on the enemy as I spoke.The two girls nodded and left to go carry out their duties.In the end, the only two that remained were me and the battle-crazed pervert.“You sure you don’t need to go after the king?” I asked. “Wasn’t killing him your goal?”
“It ain’t a problem. My contract only says that I’m in charge of fighting anyone strong,” he said. “And I’m pretty sure the strongest person in that group was you.”Crimson appeared on the man’s face as his expression contorted into that of a blushing maiden. “What a lucky man I am. I can’t believe I get to face such a strong foe. This too must be karma. Doing good deeds everyday has finally come full circle!”Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Gross. Oh god. That is literally the most disgusting expression I’ve seen in my life. Someone get me some bleach. For my eyes. Now! I simply could not imagine anything more disgusting than the man before me.“Good deeds? Looking at you, that just smells like bullshit,” I spat. Even just having the pervert around had left a bad taste in my mouth, so I kicked through the air and initiated combat.My movements were so quick that it was almost like I had initiated the fight with a teleport.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, it looks like it’s time for the obligatory “overly feminine macho man” to make his… her… their appearance. Seems like a lot of isekai novels have that kind of character. Which is odd if you consider the time period most isekai novels pull from. I don’t think there were many people like that back then. Which brings a thought to mind. I don’t think I’ve read an isekai novel where the character is sent to a world that’s in the “future” time period. They’re all back in swords and magic. Why not something like the main character being in a future time period and they summoned them because the future people need help with an “old timey” problem? I think that would be neat. If anyone has a novel like that, please lemme know. Also, a lot of y’all really got into the DnD game, and I’m real excited for future games. I’ll try and get a set schedule up so that we can get as many people playing as possible. Only one letter today, so thanks to Danthefan unless… hold on. Let me get an older sack….Nope, that’s the only one. Remember, if you’ve got a question, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll reply to it. See y’all in the next chapter!TL Note: I think ^ has the wrong impression or I messed up. Idk which. Dude isn’t supposed to be the tranny trope. He’s just supposed to fucked in the head.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Late Night in the Kitchen
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Come on, Lefi, you gotta do it! Today’s the holy day of love!” said Illuna in enthusiastic protest.
“What is this ‘holy day of love’ of which you speak?” replied the dragon girl. She was doing the usual: nothing.
“It’s a really special day everyone knows about!”The holy day of love that Illuna had mentioned was one of the world’s most well celebrated holidays. It was a day on which none would work, a day that everyone spent with their families. It was a day where girls and women alike would give sweet gifts to the men in their lives. Sweet treats were fairly difficult to come across, and not everyone was able to get their hands on them. Those that couldn’t would instead opt to provide home-cooked meals that used ingredients a bit fancier than those typically employed. And then, they’d happily spend the whole day together. If one were to ask Yuki for a description of the day, he would likely call it the result of crossbreeding Christmas with Valentine’s Day.“We should get everyone and work together to make Yuki a bunch of sweets while he’s out doing stuff around the castle! And then when he gets back, he can eat them all at once!”
“I presume that you wish for me to join you?”
“Yup yup! You totally should! Because the holy day of love is all about giving sweets to the people you love or really wanna thank! And I know you love Yuki lots too!”
“I-I do not!” Lefi responded to the accusation with panic, but she immediately realized what her loss of composure implicated, so she cleared her throat with a cough and continued on as if nothing had happened. “V-Very well. As you have taken it upon yourself to insist that I participate, I shall comply. You have gone so far, and I see no reason to refuse your invitation. I too shall try my hand at crafting a treat.”Lefi, who hadn’t known about the holiday, thought to herself: If such a day as the holy day of love truly does exist, then I may as well produce for him a sweet for the sake of my own amusement. It is not as if I do not… The dragon cut her own thought off before she could finish it and looked at the little girl before her. She had emphasized that she was only joining in because Illuna had insisted, but the little girl didn’t mind. In fact, she was nodding at her sister figure with the biggest of smiles.“Mhm! Let’s all do our best together!” she said.***Time passed. The sun, which had been high up in the sky when Illuna asked Lefi to join her, was already well below the horizon.No one was awake. Lefi looked to her side and confirmed that both Yuki and Illuna, who had slept between her and the demon lord like a child between her parents, were fast asleep. After double checking, just to make sure, the supreme dragon finally snuck out of bed and made her way over to the room next door, the kitchen.“I shall not fail again.” She hyped herself up as she secured her apron and tied it behind her back. All the tools she needed were before her. All the materials were ready. And most importantly, she was dressed for the job. It was time to get to work.Her presence in the kitchen so late at night begged a series of questions that all began with the same word: why? Why was she up so late, why was she sneaking around, and why was she cooking of all things? The answer to all three of those queries stemmed from a series of failures.Nothing that she had made during the day had ended up even remotely palatable. There had been nothing but catastrophe after catastrophe, failure after utter failure. None of her attempts succeeded, not even when Leila and Lyuu had pitched in to help. Everyone else’s attempts had eventually come to fruition. Even Illuna and Shii had managed to make something simple. But not Lefi.She hadn’t wanted the demon lord to think her incapable, so rather than admitting to failure, she instead played a different hand. She told him that she saw no reason to bother making him anything and simply pretended not to have ever tried from the start. Lefi had ended up just sitting off to the side and watching as everyone else fed Yuki the fruits of their labour.And thus, she’d gotten up in the middle of the night to redeem herself. The silver-haired maiden was, admittedly, of the lazier breed. She enjoyed slacking off. But she didn’t enjoy failure. She was the type of girl that really hated losing. And that was why she had decided to put in extra effort in order to get it right. The holy day of love had passed. But she wasn’t going to give up. Tomorrow, she thought. Tomorrow, I shall provide him with a treat so delectable his expression will contort in shock.The titan that she was set to tackle tonight was the fearsome beast known as the cookie. Her world was one that didn’t have many sweets, but the cookie was widespread nonetheless. They were much more common than other types of confections, common enough for those invested in the art of the kitchen to know a recipe or two. And as Leila happened to be an excellent chef herself, she just so happened to have one on hand. The sheep-horned demon had even provided Lefi with a memo detailing everything she needed in order to tackle the behemoth of a task before her.She was ready. Everything was in place. It was time.The expression on the supreme dragon’s face was like that of a warrior about to face off with its greatest rival.And yet, though she had been determined, she ultimately failed.“Kh…” She scoffed as she wiped the dough that had splattered onto her face off with the back of her hand and heaved an unintentional sigh as she muttered under her breath. “It appears that it did not go as well as I had hoped. I suspected as much.”The reason the dragon was incapable of cooking was in fact quite simple. She was too powerful. It wasn’t something that her appearance would betray. As far as looks went, Lefi was a gentle, adorable little maiden. She was so pretty and delicate that she put even the loveliest of flowers to shame. But that wasn’t what she truly was. She was a dragon. The supreme dragon. She was the one creature that every other living thing in this world feared.She wasn’t capable of outputting anywhere near all her power in her newfound humanoid appearance, but still, her strength was many times beyond what the words “absolutely absurd” could even begin to describe. Even her delicate girl form housed within it a tremendous power.A simple example could be derived by looking at Yuki and the tasks he performed on an everyday basis. One could say that, from an abstract point of view, the amount of strength he would use could be classified into three categories: low, medium, and high. The problem Lefi had was, for her, that both Yuki’s low and medium outputs fell within the far left end of her low bracket. Putting in even the slightest amount of strength provided Lefi with enough brute force to completely squash the trunk of a tree many times her width. While it might have sounded like something that would inconvenience her during her everyday life, it wasn’t. The dragon’s excellent sense of touch allowed her to adjust her strength accordingly when it came to almost every task. Almost being the keyword.Cooking happened to fall outside of this classification. It required a much finer degree of control than she was accustomed to. Making cookies contained a few steps that just happened to be things she found extremely difficult. One such example was cracking eggs. She would almost always completely crush the shell whenever she tried to split one open. Mixing the ingredients was just as bad. She would always stir with just a bit too much force and cause the bowl’s contents to end up all over the place. To make matters even worse, the sheer amount of strength she accidentally outputted would cause her tools to bend and distort in ways they were never designed to. And that wasn’t even the nail in the coffin.The absolute worst part was that Lefi had quite literally never stepped foot in the kitchen with the intent to make something. She was over a thousand years old, but this afternoon marked the first time she had attempted to cook anything at all. Her lazy personality didn’t particularly help either, as it made her rather clumsy.One could say that the world was a wide place. There were all sorts of people, and there was basically always guaranteed to be someone more ill-suited to something than any other given individual. As far as cooking was concerned, Lefi was that someone.She tried again. And again. And again. She kept going until she finally managed to create something that could, to an extent, be called successful.“Hah…” But again, she sighed upon seeing the fruits of her labour. “I would not be so hasty as to label this batch another failure. But yet, I must. They are far worse than anything I would willingly feed him.”The cookies were misshapen, lumpy, and deformed. And the only conclusion she could come to upon trying one herself was that they were terrible. A part of her judgement stemmed from bias. Lefi’s palate had been spoiled by the sweet treats that Yuki presented her on a daily basis. She thought them to be out of this world, which was in fact exactly what they were. They had quite literally come from another. But because she knew just how good cookies could taste, she had recognized her own creations for just how horrible they were.“I suppose I have little choice but to cease.” She wanted to keep practicing. The dragon wanted to knock the demon lord’s socks off. But she couldn’t. It literally wasn’t possible. There weren’t enough ingredients left for her to craft another batch. And even if there were, she wouldn’t be willing to try. She had wasted enough food already.Her only choice was to just give up. The amazing cookies she had wanted to make were simply too far removed from reality for her to grasp.So she sighed.“Looks like you’re finally done.”Hearing the familiar voice caused Lefi to spin around in a panic. Standing right there behind her was Yuki. He was leaning against the wall with a sleepy look on his face. He even yawned for added effect when she looked at him.Lefi was shocked. She would have long noticed him under ordinary circumstances, but she had been too engrossed in the act of making sweets to pay enough attention to her surroundings to see that someone had snuck up behind her.“H-how long have you been there!?” she stuttered.
“Honestly, around since you got out of bed.”He has been observing me this entire time!? Her face instantly turned a deep shade of crimson. She had allowed him to watch her do something that she was awful, terrible at. He didn’t care much for her damaged pride though. He ignored her indignance, walked right up to the counter and popped one of the deformed cookies she had made into his mouth.“I-I do not advise yo—”
“Yeah, I wouldn’t either. They’re god awful.” He gave her a straight-forward, honest response.
“I am aware,” she groaned. “You need not force yourself to consume them as I merely crafted them at leisure. Now hand them to me such that I may dispose of them posthaste.”Lefi tried to speak in as normal a tone as she could, and she did manage it, but that didn’t mean she was feeling just fine. The truth was his response had caused her to feel a sharp pain, like she’d been stabbed through the chest.However, despite her protests, Yuki didn’t comply with her demands.“Naw, no need. I’m planning to eat them all.”
“What…?” She was stupefied. And when she raised her face to look at him she found him grinning at her.
“I heard from Illuna. You went through a bunch of trouble just to get these made for me,” he said with a cocky smirk. “And that’s why I’ll eat them all. Throwing them away is just a waste of effort and food. Especially since they’re so stuffed full of love.”
“Th-they are absolutely not!” Lefi immediately flared up at the demon lord, but he just laughed it off as he quickly consumed all the remaining cookies.She tried to stop him over and over, but, even though he himself had told her that they were awful, he ended up eating them nonetheless. Once he was done, he plopped one of his hands on her head and smiled as carefree a smile as could be.“They were delicious, Lefi. Thanks,” he said as he ran his fingers through her hair.The expression on his face filled her chest with warmth. And she thought, I know the expression I bear, but I know that it is one I shan’t allow myself to show another.“Even a child could see through such an unclever ruse,” she said. “And I wish not for you to treat me as you would one.”Despite her protests, she made no attempts to shake his hand off her head. Instead, she chose to bury her face in his chest.***TL Note: As you might have expected, this was posted shortly after Valentine’s Day. Specifically in 2017.Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Aww, isn’t that sweet? Lefi and Yuki sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G! Lefi? Lefi, what are you doing? Lefi, put down the warhammer! NOOOO-! *there’s a loud crashing and crunching sound and the screen goes to black. After a few seconds, it comes back on, only this time, he’s sitting all bandaged up, voice muffled* Uh… sorry about that, folks. I, uh… retract my statement that I said about Yuki and Lefi. There are not ‘sitting in a tree’ and are most certainly not ‘K-I-S-S-I-N-G’. *to someone off screen* Is that okay? Please? It is? Oh, thank God… Uh, sorry about the confusion, folks. Just a minor disagreement. Nothing major. I’ll be fine… I hope… God, I still feel my ribs poking my spine… *winces* Uh, anyway, we got 6 letters today, so big thank you to Tonatsi, kx, Confusing thingy (@DanPamfiloiu), Hobbes, zekkendo, and Mischa.

A Battle Within a Castle — Part 3
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerA silent frown sat upon Nell’s face as she moved through the castle.“Are you worried about him?” Sensing that she wasn’t in the calmest of states, Carlotta turned to the girl beside her.
“Yeah. I am.” Nell hesitated for a moment before answering with a nod. “How could I not be? The man that attacked us, the man he’s fighting right now is an orichalcum class adventurer, isn’t he?”Thinking of the masked individual currently locked in combat caused Carlotta to reflect on the operation as a whole. All in all, it was going smoothly, extremely smoothly. She had been prepared for much worse. She and the knights that accompanied her were in the midst of an assault on the country’s one and only royal castle. It would have, by all means, made sense for them to be given a “warm welcome.” And in fact, she had ironically experienced exactly that. Effectively speaking, she had yet to run into any hostile soldiers. More than half of those present within the castle’s walls had turned out to be allies still loyal to the king.She had expected that there would indeed be loyalists, but she hadn’t thought that they would be so plentiful in number. The unexpectedly high headcount was something she had thought of as a fortunate miscalculation. She didn’t have to lose as many of her companions as she had thought.The unexpected boon stemmed from the citizens’ assault on the castle’s front gate. The prince’s rebel faction had no choice but to suppress the armed revolt that Alshir’s people were currently engaged in. And as a result, the prince’s dogs, those that obeyed his every order and sought to put him on the throne, had exited the scene.Of course, it was none other than Carlotta herself that had instigated the revolt in the first place. Not that she minded. Her thoughts on the matter were as follows: If a few well-phrased words can lead to my enemy’s defeat, then so be it. I’ll say them as many times as I need to.As far as Carlotta was concerned, such an act was a given. She was the type of person to use every card in her hand in order to achieve victory. Her flexibility was, in fact, one of the two main reasons she had been appointed as the operation’s supreme commander in the first place. The other had been her strength, the sheer extent of her might.Strangely enough, the king was already safe. The most difficult part of the mission was over with her troops knowing none of the hardship it entailed. The masked man, who was supposed to run off in pursuit of an enemy observer, had already gone ahead and rescued the king for reasons unknown.And while that was wonderful news, it seemed that not all would go as smoothly as she had hoped. His Majesty had expressed interest in accompanying her and her squad for the remainder of their mission. And in fact, he had then proceeded to do exactly that. Honestly speaking, Carlotta found the ruler’s decision a royal pain in the ass. The fact that she had no choice but to comply gave her a massive headache. She wanted to scream at him and tell him to get to safety, but she couldn’t. His decision was firm and changing his mind had already proven extremely difficult. She and her knights had no choice but to escort him even at the cost of their own safety. It was likely that his decision would ultimately cause a number of her companions’ lives to be cut short. Literally.Another one of Carlotta’s miscalculations was the appearance of the assailant that had the girl beside her as worried as she was. The Adventurers’ Guild had initially taken a hands-off approach to the entire political situation. And they were supposed to stay neutral. But evidently, they hadn’t.“If the masked man is as strong as observation has led me to believe, then I think that he should at least be able to put up a fight.” Only after a fair bit of internal reflection did Carlotta finally reply. “And if the weapon he was carrying was the one he was most accustomed to, then what he said would be true. Ally reinforcements would only end up getting in his way.”The massive sword was one that had caught Carlotta’s interest. Its curved, single-edged blade was beautiful enough to charm any that looked upon it. Its size provided as many disadvantages as it did advantages, one of which was its incompatibility with backup. She could easily imagine a scenario in which he accidentally split an ally in half whilst delivering a blow upon the foe before him.There was literally no choice but to leave handling the assailant to their masked ally. Although she had relegated him to the role of dealing with the adventurer by his lonesome, Carlotta did still understand Nell’s concern.His face was one that any Allysian warrior would recognize. He, the War Freak, was just that famous. Like all other orichalcum class adventurers, he was so powerful that he had a foot in the realm that only legendary heroes were ever allowed to tread. Not even the guild was able to do much to influence him. They couldn’t control him, and they definitely couldn’t expel him given that he was one of the strongest there was. His nickname stemmed from his abnormal lust for combat. He would show up on every battlefield he could, regardless of consequence or purpose. The War Freak may as well have been a walking ball of chaos.***There was a flash as the battle maniac’s blade drove itself towards me. I twisted my body to avoid it, and then returned fire by swinging Zaien. The many times we had crossed blades had informed him that my strikes were unnaturally heavy, so rather than taking the attack head on, he instead warded it off with a parry. My blade missed him and instead cleaved the earth to his side. Dirt and small rocks were scattered all over as the attack left a veritable hole in the ground below.I tried to follow the attack with another, but was denied the opportunity. The pervert’s blade slithered towards the back of my neck and threatened to tear it off, so I leapt away from him to avoid the blow.“Hahahaha!” He laughed heartily. “That’s some brute strength you got there! And your reactions are incredible! You sure are one hell of a catch.”
“Shut the fuck up and stop looking at me with that hideous face of yours, you goddamn creep!” The man was giving me goosebumps, so I started spitting abusive profanities at him while flipping him off with the hand I wasn’t using to wield my blade.The man’s stats were high.***General Information

He Who Dances With Death***Like holy crap. This dude’s stronk. My stats were still a fair bit higher than his, but he had me completely outclassed in terms of swordplay. I didn’t have the liberty to check out his unique skills in detail given that we were mid-combat. But their names seem to imply that they’ll probably activate when he’s about to die or when it hits the 11th hour.Fortunately, the many times we had clashed had proved that I was able to bulldoze through his technical skill with nothing but brute force. My body’s specs were the only reason I was still hanging on. I was convinced that I surely would have become a headless fountain of blood or just another corpse impaled on the end of his blade had my stats been even just a little bit lower. Thank god I’m a Demon Lord. Dungeon, I owe you big time. You’re the best.As a resident of the Wicked Forest, I had many chances to engage in battle. I hunted all the time. But despite that, I rarely ever chose to challenge anything truly formidable. The reason was obvious. Unlike the pervert before me, I wasn’t the type that enjoyed putting my life on the line just to indulge in potential victory.The purpose of hunting monsters was just to supply myself with DP, so there was no sense in putting myself at risk. And even when I did end up in danger, I wasn’t alone. Rir, my ever faithful companion, would always be by my side. Ughhhh. I just want to bury my face in Rir’s fluff and forget about all this fight to the death bullshit. I just want to keep rubbing my cheeks against his soft fuzzy fur while ignoring the fact that he’s looking at me and is all awkward and troubled over what he’s supposed to think or feel. God damn it. Why do I have to be stuck in a two man dance to the death with this creepy, perverted degenerate again? Fuck. This is all that stupid fucking prince’s fault. I swear to god I’m going to make sure I end him. Personally.“Why do you have to be so cold?” The pervert frowned. “Can’t you see how head over heels I am for you right now?”He stepped forward, into his range, and struck. I used Zaien to prevent the attack, but failed to catch the follow-up. I was too preoccupied and disturbed by him to see it, so I ended up eating a straight punch to the gut.I groaned as a dull pain suddenly began to cloud my consciousness. But just as I was on the brink of losing myself to it, I caught his blade darting towards my heart out of the corner of my eye, so I forced myself to focus and twisted my upper body just enough to evade it.“You can fuck right off!” I used the momentum from the twisting motion to deliver a reckless spin kick. My complete lack of a stance upon the attack’s inception seemed to have caught him off guard. The attack landed. My foot had flown right into his shoulder and sent him flying into the castle wall. “And drown while you’re at it!”I then began channelling my magical energies and flung one of my signature water dragon spells at the pervert. Although the impact resulting from the kick had momentarily caused him to freeze up, he still managed to react to the dragon and leap out of its way. The serpent’s watery jaws ended up crashing into the wall and splashing all over, blocking the pervert’s line of sight.And that was my chance. I had created the perfect opportunity to end the battle before either of my foe’s unique skills could kick in.Because I had yet to stop channelling my mana.I funnelled it into the blade of my sword and kicked off the ground with all the force I could muster. He couldn’t see. The obstruction delayed his ability to react, but he still managed to swing his sword just in time to intercept the blow. Or he would have, had I actually tried to land it. What I impaled was not him, but rather the ground in front of him. Fire began to swell from the ground below, dying our surroundings in a deep shade of red.“What!?” The pervert shouted in surprise.His surprise resulted from my blade’s magic circuit, a circuit I had asked Leila to craft for me. The circuit was the type that activated whenever mana was poured into it. It caused flames to spew from the weapon and light whatever it cut ablaze. The amount of fire it created changed depending on the amount of mana consumed. The massive flames that had shocked the pervert were the result of something somewhere in the middle of the road.At first, I had thought to make my own magic circuits. But upon further consideration, I realized that there was no point. Leila was obviously much more familiar with them, so I had asked her to do it instead of slaving away at something that I was clearly bad at. She readily consented. Apparently, she had been looking for a chance to experiment with 3D magic circuits, as they were something along the lines of a new technology in a field that she had always studied. She proved herself extremely capable, as she was able to create the exact circuit I requested. And so, I inscribed it into my blade. Its name was Crimson Blaze. I think I’mma probably have her make the circuits I’ll put into Zaien’s other two slots as well. Though it’ll have to wait until after I think up something decent.I let go of the blade and peered beyond the flames. The battle-crazed freak had been shaken by the sudden surge of heat, and again, his view had been obstructed. I used my magic eye to locate his heart, drew my magical handgun from its holster on my waist, took aim, and fired.There was a whistle. And after a moment’s delay, it was followed by the sound of something bursting open.Zaien’s flames waned. They began to die down, but then suddenly sprung to life once more, almost as if they’d been fanned by some sort of motion. Crisis Detection activated and filled my entire body with a sense of impending doom. It was coming from my side. There was something right beside my neck.I looked, only to see the pervert standing right there. I had no idea when or how he’d gotten there, but there was a visible hole that went all the way through his side and came out the other end. Shit! That didn’t finish him!“Hahahahaha!” Blood was spilling from his mouth. He was grievously wounded, but he laughed nonetheless. “You’re not bad! Not bad at all!”And in that instant, his sword began to move. Straight towards my head.Time almost seemed to slow to a standstill. The blade felt like it was approaching frame by frame. I could see it slowly drawing closer to my eyes. Fuck. I can’t dodge it.The judgement I made almost seemed to trigger an instinctive action. The arm I had my gun in moved without me willing it to and positioned itself right between my face and the incoming blade.I heard it right as time began to speed back up. The blade pierced my arm and caused a sharp pain to begin coursing through my nerves. It hurt so bad I wanted to break down and start crying like a child.But because it pained me, I knew. I knew that I was still alive.Impaling my arm had caused the blade to shift its course. And so, rather than skewering my brain, it had only skimmed the side of my skull.I immediately shaped my other, empty hand like a blade and thrusted it straight into the man’s chest. The hard sensation of bone was soon followed by the raw, unpleasant feeling of running my hands through raw flesh.My aim was true.His heart had been annihilated.Fresh blood scattered through the air like petals in the wind as my arm erupted from his back.My opponent, who had finally stopped swinging his weapon, slowly looked down and confirmed that my arm had run him through before gradually turning his gaze up once more.“That was… one hell of a… fun fight….” Blood spilled from his lips en masse, but he smiled regardless, content with the battle’s result.His consciousness waned.Silence.He had become one with the void.The man fell to his knees and then onto the ground as I withdrew my bloodstained arm from within his chest.“You probably should’ve grinded a bit more.” I looked down upon him and reciprocated his grin with a smirk. “It was still too early for you to challenge the likes of a Demon Lord.”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Well, that certainly was a satisfying way to end this fight. Also, yes, I know that boss is saying that this guy isn’t the stereotypical ‘macho gay man’, but that’s what I thought of. I guess I read too many isekais… Sorry if I’m not completely up to snuff. I’m having a bit of an identity crisis in Final Fantasy XIV… from the time I started playing the game up until end game in Stormblood, I’ve been a Black Mage. But I tried out Samurai, and I find myself really loving Samurai…. Now, I don’t know what to level up in Shadowbringers, Black Mage or Samurai…. It’s rough… Um, anyway, we got two letters today, so thanks to zekkendo and kx for your questions. If you’ve got a question you want to ask, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll answer it. See y’all in the next chapter…. *sigh* Black Mage or Samurai….?<– Prev — Next –>

The Audience Chamber — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Shit… My friggin hand…” I cursed and grimaced as I grit my teeth and tried to bear with it. Oh god, the pain. Seriously, what the hell Yuki? You can’t just leave the guy you finished off with a fancy one-liner if you’re dripping in cold sweat!The pervert’s sword was still stuck in my arm. I stared at it for a moment and hesitated, but soon made up my mind. Aw, what the hell. I might as well just get it over with. I pulled on the weapon and drew it from my flesh in one go.“Arggghhhhhhh! Mother fucker!” Blood immediately started to pour from the wound as profanities and screams of agony poured from my throat. I immediately cast it aside by throwing it away. Aw man… This is awful. This hurts so bad I think I might cry. My sword wound was obviously the worst of my injuries, but it wasn’t the only thing that hurt. Impaling my foe had caused the fingers in that hand to bend the wrong way. They definitely looked broken, and the pain I felt from them told roughly the same tale.Of course, all my troubles had stemmed from the fact that my finishing blow wasn’t something that I had planned ahead of time. It was something instinctive, an attack that I had done on the spur of the moment. Thankfully, it actually finished him, or else I’d be in some real deep shit right about now.I had thought to myself just a bit earlier in the day that amateurs like me shouldn’t attempt things that only professionals knew how to do. And yet, I had gone and done it again. The manga I had read in my previous life had often depicted characters performing barehanded attacks much like the one I had just carried out, so I’d thought that I would be fine. But now, I knew for a fact that the characters in question had only ever seemed fine because they were putting up a front. There was simply no way the act wouldn’t have caused their fingers to break. And now I know why they say not to try things you see on TV or whatever at home.I opened up my item box and reached inside with the hand with the broken fingers. The other hand’s fingers simply didn’t want to respond to me at all, so I didn’t really have much of a choice. I then used the palm of my hand to retrieve a high-grade potion, or elixir as the king had called it, and popped the cork with my teeth. Without any further delay, I began pouring the liquid all over my sword wound.I leaked an anguished groan the moment the liquid touched me, but the pain soon subsided as the wound promptly began to fix itself. The process was basically the exact opposite of the process that had led to its injury; I almost felt like I was watching a video of the wound getting opened up in reverse. Before long, the whole thing disappeared. There wasn’t a trace of it left. It was almost like it had never existed to begin with.I used my now-fixed arm to grab ahold of the potion and poured it on my other hand’s fingers, which made an unpleasant cracking noise as they too went back to normal in a matter of moments. Wait, didn’t I literally just convince myself to be a bit more careful about using them outside the Wicked Forest? Yeah no. Why the hell would I do that when these things are so goddamn convenient? Just one of them fixed me up in no time flat. For fuck’s sake, what kind of idiot would even suggest being more prudent in the first place? Oh wait, it was me.In the long run, I viewed the whole series of events as a learning experience, and I did, in fact, learn a lot about just how useful the potions could be. Hoarding them was way more of a waste than just straight up using them whenever I felt the need, especially if my reason for not using them was that I was too afraid of what others might think. Therefore, as illustrated in the proof above, not using them is simply not an option. QED.I picked up my magical handgun and holstered it before pulling Zaien from the earth and propping it up on top of my shoulders. Only after checking to make sure my weapons were in place did I finally look back down at him.“He really was a strong one though,” I muttered. Man, I seriously thought that last attack was going to kill me. My face would totally be on the end of a blade right now if I didn’t manage to twist my arm just a bit and throw his stab off course. I basically only won because my stats were higher than his.The pervert’s blade was the fastest I’d ever seen. I was only able to track it because of the ridiculous kinetic vision granted to me by my demon lord tier body. Another interesting thing to note was that my stats trumped his despite the fact that his level was much higher than mine. The people I’d analyzed led me to believe that, as a race, humanity had great potential for growth. Yet, despite that, not even an orichalcum class adventurer, an individual that stood close to humanity’s apex, had stats that matched my own.Humans were just quantitatively inferior. And it wasn’t something that they seemed to be able to ultimately overcome. That said, it wasn’t like I could just go ahead and fight a bunch of orichalcum adventurers all at once. That would be a recipe for disaster. I’d get stomped on and rekt. I should probably work on both the dungeon’s defences and getting stronger myself as soon as I get back. But that’s a thought for later. I’ve pretty much done everything I needed to do here, so I should go ahead and catch up with Nell and her buddies for the time being.I happened to hear the sound of shattering glass right as the thought passed through my mind. Accompanying it was a great clamour, a mass of voices so loud I could hear it from outside the castle.And it was all coming from up above.“I wonder what’s happening up there?” As interested as I was, my current angle didn’t allow me to see much at all. Maybe the knights ended up getting into a big fight or something. I mean, we’re talking about a castle here, so up top is probably where all the important people are gathered, right? The knights were probably headed up too, so a fight seems pretty likely. Welp. No point sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Might as well head over.While I did want to get up to where the knights were, I wasn’t interested in slowly making my way through the castle. That just sounded like a royal pain in the ass. I guess I’ll just fly.I both scanned the area and checked the map to make sure there wasn’t anyone looking in my direction before activating stealth, sprouting both pairs of wings, and leaping into the air. I felt myself almost leave the bounds of gravity as a floaty sensation enveloped my entire being. The ground, which had been right before my face, suddenly shrank beneath me.After getting a bit closer to the source, I peered through the broken window. There, I saw a fierce melee. The hero, Carlotta, and the rest of the rescue squad had taken up a defensive formation around the king in order to keep him safe from a group of soldiers that I assumed were most likely affiliated with the prince.There was no comparing the two groups. The knights were so much stronger than the soldiers that they were taking them down with one or two blows each. Or at least that was what it had looked like out of the corner of my eye.My focus was directed elsewhere. My gaze was centred on a single man standing on top of an elevated platform at the back of the room. He was dressed well, and his stance made him look like a cocky little shit. The way the soldiers were protecting him made it obvious that he was the prince I had been looking for.I used Analyze just to make sure. And found something… interesting. Something I didn’t expect. I was so surprised that I started running my mouth in a way I typically didn’t. Now hol’ up a fuckin’ secon’! Dis muddafukka’s already dead!<– Prev — Next –>

The Audience Chamber — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Seize those rebels immediately!” I heard the prince shouting a bunch of nonsense as he stood atop the elevated platform. It didn’t make sense. He was literally a dead man talking, and that shouldn’t have been possible. Altering one’s status page was definitely doable, but only to a certain extent. Dramatic lies like having literally no HP weren’t possible. And that was exactly what the prince’s stat screen displayed. His health was sitting at a flat zero.I had even used magic eye in order to double check that I wasn’t crazy. Lo and behold, he wasn’t all that different from the zombies that I had encountered back in that one old guy’s city. He was bound with magical energy from head to toe.The more I looked at him, the more I realized that I wasn’t staring down a person. I was looking at a thing, a mere puppet that could no longer think for itself. I didn’t know whether he was being controlled through a skill or a spell, but either way, I knew that his manipulator was at least more skilled than the only other I’d ever known. I wonder if he’s been infected by a plaga or something. Nah, no way. Plaga are just parasites. People with plaga in them aren’t actually dead or anything. [1]Alright, that’s enough joking around for now. Let’s get back on track. After looking at him more carefully, I realized that the prince’s central nervous system was especially well bound with magic and that his bindings had mana actively flowing through them. His brain, spine, and nerves were all under his manipulator’s control. It was a feature not shared by any of the zombies I’d seen before, and likely the reason his corpse seemed so animated and alive despite having lost its life force.That said, the whole scenario brought a question to mind: why hasn’t anyone noticed? If there was such a thing as a technique to manipulate one’s enemies, then there was no reason for there not to be countermeasures and methods by which one could detect that another was being controlled. They simply had to exist. And of all people, one would expect the family ruling a country to have access to something that performed the aforementioned roles. If they didn’t, then I wouldn’t have much to say besides that they were horribly ill-prepared.Thinking back on my conversation with the king had made the whole scenario make even less sense. He himself had stated that he thought something was wrong with his son and that his actions were growing more suspicious. It would only make sense for the king to have the prince checked. And it wasn’t like he was the only one to ever interact with his son either. While I had no idea as to exactly when the prince had become a zombie, I knew that people seeing the signs meant that someone should have realized that something was up.Wait a second… My eyes stopped on one of the rings the douchebag of a prince had on his finger, one containing an excess of magical energy. Appraising informed me that it was the Ring of Truth and Falsehood. It was an item capable of deceiving those that tried to view the user’s status page. Its quality was ridiculously high and came in at a jaw-dropping S-. I guess that must be why no one’s ever found out. S- is almost as high-quality as high-quality gets.The reason that I was able to see the prince’s stats regardless was likely because my Analyze skill was leveled to a near abnormal extent. It didn’t feel that way given that I was still unable to get even a glimpse of Lefi’s stats, but I had actually raised it so far beyond the norm that not even an item with a quality rating of S- could trick it. Geez Lefi, just how OP are you!?I smiled awkwardly, but then once again redirected my attention away from my distractions and back towards the situation at hand. My gaze once again fell upon the room. The prince was just a puppet, and someone else was pulling his strings. The corpse was acting far too realistically for the manipulator to be at a distance.Whoever was responsible was literally making the poor retarded thing talk, after all. And the only way for the puppet’s words not to sound odd was for the one pulling its strings to be aware of the situation. He had to know what everyone else in the room was saying. Making up words wouldn’t go well without a detailed account of exactly what was going on.There was, of course, always the possibility that he was using something similar to my Evil Eyes or Evil Ears, but I struck it out almost as quickly as I had suggested it. My Magic Eye wasn’t picking up on anything.The easiest way to describe my unique skill was to call it something along the lines of a thermal scope that worked with magic instead of heat. Any mana it picked up would simply stand out. It was just that obvious. I could even see people that were using skills akin to Stealth, as the skill made use of magical energy in order to produce its cloaking effect.Of course, I had never tested it on anyone with a level 10 stealth skill, but level 10 skills weren’t all that realistic in the first place. Even Lefi had claimed that they were rare. The Supreme Dragon had told me that, although she had a literal arsenal’s worth of skills, only a handful had reached their final level.And so, upon coming to the aforementioned conclusion, I began to regard the enemies before me in turn whilst using both my Magic Eye and Analyze in tandem.It didn’t take me long to find the perp. He seemed to resemble some sort of minister. He was situated in the corner of the room and wearing a hood that covered his face and hid it from view. Unfortunately, the pendant he was wearing around his neck was giving off something along the lines of a jamming signal. I literally could not use Analyze on him. But as far as I was concerned, all that meant was that he had something to hide.That said, the most decisive factor wasn’t how suspicious he seemed. It was his mana. Everyone’s magical energy had its own unique wavelength, and as Magic Eye could pick up on those differences, I was able to discern that his mana matched the mana contained in the fetters binding the prince.He was the guy behind the curtain, the guy pulling the strings and manipulating the puppet. Heh. What a nasty little asshole. He’s using other people and tricking them into fighting as he enjoys the whole thing from backstage.But the manipulator behind the prince’s behaviour wasn’t all he was. The man was my enemy. He was the asshole that had marched an army into the Wicked Forest. Listen here douchebag, you’ve got a tab to pay. A big one.I put a figurative mark on my target before looking around for an entry point. And after a few moments, I found one that satisfied my needs. I backed up in order to give myself enough room to ramp up speed, twisted my body so that I was facing forwards, and then gave my wings a single powerful flap.The wind rushed past me. I could feel the pressure pushing against me as I soared through it. Right as I was about to crash through the window, I retracted my wings and braced for impact.There was a loud crash. Shattered glass flew everywhere as the people inside the audience chamber began shouting in surprise and scrambling to determine the identity of the sudden intruder. But I didn’t stop. I didn’t let them process what had happened before I carried out my next move.I used the force of my entry to dart straight towards the manipulator, who was still stunned by my sudden appearance. And before he could question my allegiance, I swung my blade.***[1] Resident Evil<– Prev — Next –>

The Audience Chamber — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe first thing Nell felt upon entering the audience chamber was a sense of unease. And it wasn’t a problem wrought by the room itself.After all, the room she was standing in was the one the king used to receive his guests. It was made to be glamorous. Gorgeous ornaments could be seen all over, and there was even a raised platform a bit further in. Atop the platform sat a single seat reserved only for the king. A throne. The throne was so beautifully made that even those that knew nothing of craftsmanship could tell that it was of an extremely high quality. The rest of the furniture, which lay arranged throughout the room, matched its atmosphere perfectly, and the windows had been strategically engineered in order to provide just the right amount of light. All these factors came together as one and made the chamber seem even more graceful than the sum of its parts.Only one thing, or rather group of things, didn’t quite fit. Half the room was filled with fully armed soldiers that looked just about as out of place as could be.His Highness the prince, the objective that the rescue squad had set out to capture, stood upon the raised platform at the back of the room. He began to speak in a loud, booming voice the moment Nell and her companions had entered.“Behold, men. Those who wish to bring our country to ruin have finally come! Seize those rebels immediately! They are traitors, bygones captivated by the values of old. And that is not all. They are incompetents that wish for nothing but to impede our growth as a nation!” There was no doubt in his words. He was convinced that he was just. And as were his troops. They took up arms the moment he ordered them to and prepared themselves for battle.The center of attention, His Highness, was the source of Nell’s malaise. She couldn’t quite put her finger on what it was, but her instincts told her that it was the look in his eyes. Everything else about the prince seemed rather normal. His behaviour was grand and he carried himself in a way befitting of a member of royalty; his body almost seemed to radiate an aura of magnaminty. But his eyes alone stood out as odd. Something about them struck her. It was almost like the light that filled them had rotted away.She knew that something was wrong. But she didn’t get the chance to voice her suspicions. Things were happening too fast for her to offer her doubt.“Your Highness, you are suspected of high treason. We will have you surrender yourselves to us!” shouted Carlotta. The operation’s commander followed the declaration by immediately issuing orders. “Our mission has seen nothing but easy progress. Now, we must fight hard enough to make up for all the effort that we hadn’t the need to invest elsewhere!”
“Yes ma’am!” The knights barked back a response, and like the soldiers, drew their arms and prepared for combat.
“Your Majesty, I know that you most likely have a lot on your mind right now, but I must ask of you to stand aside and allow us to handle the situation.” After addressing her knights, Carlotta turned to the king.
“Very well.” Though the expression on his face was bitter, he nodded and complied with her instructions by shifting behind the rescue squad.His movements served to initiate the battle. The two groups immediately began clashing blades.The result was a one-sided slaughter. Nell knew that she and Carlotta both completely outclassed every soldier present. The first of the two was the church’s hero, and the other an exemplary knight. The soldiers were unable to stand up to them. The prince’s troops didn’t even find themselves capable of halting the pair’s advance.While they were definitely the stars of the show, the truth of the matter was that the end result would not have differed much regardless of whether they were present. Every single member of the rescue squad was hand-picked. They were the most prominent members of the elite, the cream of the crop. The skill they demonstrated in dispatching the soldiers that filled the audience chamber failed to put their reputation to shame.The prince’s defeat and subsequent capture was only a matter of time. The rescue squad would soon have full control of the area.Nell, however, wasn’t thinking of victory or glory. Her head was instead filled with thoughts of the demon lord that had stayed behind to delay the orichalcum class adventurer. The only reason the operation had gone so smoothly was because he had taken on the role of handling the strongest of the enemy’s forces. So dangerous was the man that attacked them that even Nell, who was ignorant of the world at large, knew his face. For he was the War Freak, an adventurer near unmatched in battle.Yuki was, as a demon lord, quite powerful in his own right. But the same was true of his foe. Nell soon came to the conclusion that the two would take a significant amount of time to conclude their battle, given that they were both fearsome entities to face in combat. That’s right, she thought to herself, Yuki’s taken on the most dangerous role. We can’t just leave him. We have to finish as quickly as possible so we can go help him.Both Carlotta and Yuki himself had stated that backup would only get in the way, but that didn’t sit well with Nell. She knew that there just had to be something she could do. It wasn’t like helping was literally impossible. Not helping him just wasn’t something she could accept.And so, with that in mind, she continued to resolve herself to do battle—only to end up distracted by another thought. Why does His Highness seem so calm?The rescue squad was overwhelming the prince’s soldiers. The audience chamber was sure to fall into her allies’ hands. And yet, the prince’s expression remained as confident as ever. Nell immediately began to suspect that it was because the prince had a trump card, something that could turn the situation around and seize victory.There was a loud crash the moment the thought passed through her head. One of the windows had been violently smashed to bits as something entered the room.Her train of thought had all but convinced her that enemy reinforcements had come. But upon craning her neck and looking at the intruder, she found that she was wrong. The person that had entered the stage was none other than the demon lord that had been on her mind the whole time.***I swung Zaien. The diagonal, downwards slash was backed with all the force of my window-breaking entrance. My target paused for a moment of surprise but raised his arms in front of him once he realized that he was under attack. My strike came into contact with his defence. I felt the blade mash up against something much harder than flesh. Was he wearing something metallic around his arms?But either way, he wasn’t able to fully stop my strike. I ended up lopping off both his arms before leaving a deep diagonal gash across his chest that ran from his shoulder all the way down to his waist. Shit. It was a bit too shallow.Blood violently gushed from both his stumpy, handless arms and his chest wound, but he didn’t collapse. My strike hadn’t been fatal. But while it hadn’t destroyed him, it had destroyed his enchanted pendant. I took the opportunity to analyze him and read his status page.“The hell!?” I shouted, surprised. “You’re a demon!?”
“You have Analyze!?” He gave an equally surprised response before making a motion with his jaw, one that seemed like some sort of order.“Watch out, Your Majesty!” I spun around and looked behind me as I heard some of the knights begin to shout. There, I found the prince in the midst of an attack. He stepped down from the platform he was on, drew the ceremonial blade on his waist, and began to charge at the king. The guards realized that they had to shift gears the moment he began to move. They drove their blades into his body with a series of fierce slashes as soon as they recognized that he was hostile.But he didn’t stop. Which is kinda obvious. I mean, the dude’s a zombie. He’s already dead. Why would he care if he’s missing half his guts?The stunned guards were too shaken by the sight to act in time. Their movements dulled to the point where the king’s safety looked like it would actually be put in peril, so I clicked my tongue, drew my gun, and fired a few shots into the prince’s limbs.Every last bullet hit its mark dead on. The force of the attacks caused the prince-turned-puppet’s legs to tangle. I turned back towards the demon after confirming the prince’s collapse, only to see a pair of fangs come right for me.I swivelled out of the way but soon found out that the reason the attack had seemed so half-hearted was because attacking had never truly been the demon’s goal. A pair of wings sprouted from his back and burst from his robe as he dashed towards the window I had come in from.“Oh hell no! You’re not getting away!”I pointed my gun at him and started firing, but he moved like a falling leaf in the wind. He swayed to and fro and dodged most of my shots. Only one landed, but it didn’t even so much as cause him to stumble. He leapt out of the castle regardless. Aw crap. What do I do now? Should I chase him?Following the demon would mean materializing my wings and exposing my identity, so I hesitated. Unfortunately, my momentary unwillingness turned out to be a critical mistake. The sky was to the demon what water was to a fish. He rapidly picked up speed the moment he made it outside and zoomed off at an incredible speed. He was so fast that it only took him a few seconds to get outside my map’s range. He turned into a speck on the horizon, then vanished altogether shortly afterwards.“Fuck!”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Boy, how about that? The prince was already dead, and the one controlling him turned out to be a demon. This could be interesting. Yuki might have to go have some dealings with the demon race to find out who this soon-to-be-dead dude is. I also wonder what reward the king will give him. He’s gotta give him something, even if it’s just a promise not to go into the forest anymore without permission. At least, you’d think so. Also should be interesting to see how he gets away from Carlotta. Whether she tries to stop him from leaving to ask him those questions, or he just shuts her down entirely, I’ll have to wait and see. One letter today, so thanks to Confusing thingy. Now, I’m tired, so I’m going to bed. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Aftermath
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“What… exactly is the meaning of this?”I stopped glaring in the direction the demon had flown off in and turned back around to face the room once I heard the king’s voice break the silence that accompanied the unexpected situation.The caster that had manipulated and quite literally taken control of the prince had left the area, so his spell had been undone. Without anyone to maintain control of it, the prince’s corpse had collapsed, fallen to the floor unmoving. There were still a few blades stuck in his side. But as he was a corpse, very little blood leaked from the prince’s wounds.Confused and filled with grief, the king kneeled before his son’s remains. The prince was no longer the son that he had once known, but he took him in his arms and stared in shock nonetheless. His boy had passed, seemingly before his very eyes.Likewise, the soldiers loyal to the prince stared in confusion. Like the king, they were unable to follow the series of events that had led to their leader’s collapse. Even the rescue squad was stupefied, but they soon recovered and got back to work. They disarmed all the prince’s soldiers and rounded them up. The men quietly obeyed and displayed no further resistance. They knew that a counteroffensive was impossible without their leader, the man that had provided them a banner under which they could rally.“Well, king.” I moved over to the country’s ruler as I spoke to him. “It looks like someone was pulling your son’s strings. Literally.”
“All this time…?” His voice trembled with regret as he slowly tore his gaze from the man that was once his heir and turned it upon me. I could see in his eyes that his heart was filled with lament, that he was blaming himself for everything that had happened.
“Probably.” But I answered him in my usual tone nonetheless.
“I do not deserve to call myself a father.” He closed his eyes. “I noticed that he had changed. I saw the signs. I knew that something was wrong, and yet, I did nothing. I failed to truly understand what it was that my son was plagued by. Not until the day that I saw him fall before my very eyes.”
“Your Majesty…” Nell tried to comfort the king. Her voice was filled with an empathetic sorrow that gave way to her intentions, but she couldn’t quite seem to find the right words.
“I am sorry, Riutt…” The king turned his gaze back towards his son, closed his eyes, and began to run his hand through the boy’s hair. “I should have known that you were suffering. As your father, I should have been able to protect you from all the hardship you were forced to endure. And yet, I failed you. I’m sorry, Riutt. I’m so sorry…”The rest of us remained silent as we watched the king, the father bring his son’s remains to his chest and quietly sob as he mourned his loss.***The whole civil war fought between the two factions came to a rather smooth end. The leader of the prince’s faction, which was obviously none other than the prince himself, had ended up turning into a lifeless corpse. With their leader gone, the nobles that supported him were thrown into a state of confusion and disorder. It didn’t take long for those within the capital to be rounded up and brought to justice. That said, not all of the prince’s supporters had even been present to begin with. Some were still holed up in their territories, but whatever the case, their heads were sure to fly off their shoulders in the near future. Literally. My condolences. RIP.After his release from prison, the king was once again reinstated as the country’s ruler and placed at its helm. Honestly, a part of me was surprised that he had agreed to it. He had seemed so depressed that I thought he was about to just go ahead and off himself. However, he seemed to have resolved himself shortly after. The king knew that ending his own life and leaving the country without a head of state would be irresponsible, and he seemed to believe that he would have no right to visit his son’s grave lest he ensured that the country was restored to a state of stability. Only after seeing through his duty would the king reconsider handing off the crown.As the incident had caused many heads to fly, the parliament had ended up with a large number of empty seats, seats that found themselves ultimately filled by members of the church. The privilege was granted to them as a result of the major part they played in the king’s rescue. The fact that the church had ended up as a much larger part of the political landscape likely meant that everything had gone according to plan. Its newfound political influence in turn meant that the church would ultimately end up being a much more significant force overall. Wow. They sure are ambitious for a bunch of clergymen. Whatever happened to men of the cloth being modest and stuff?And that was just about how the aftermath went. Personally though, I felt as if most of my effort had been flushed right down the drain. Of course, it wasn’t as if I had gained literally nothing, but I still wasn’t all that happy about the way the situation had turned out. Finding out that the prince wasn’t my only concern had tilted me, especially since it happened right when I felt like I had just brought everything to an end. Like seriously, gimme a break. What is this? Some manga for teenage boys where a new, more powerful antagonist shows up at the end of every arc? Yeah, no thanks. Nothing could possibly be more obnoxious.The one saving grace was that said new antagonist probably didn’t know who I was. My race still said human, and I’d been wearing a mask the whole time. It was unlikely that he, or anyone else for that matter, would come to learn my true identity. I was confident that the dungeon would remain out of harm’s way, that I would be able to enjoy a period of peace. Man, I know I was the one to insist on wearing it and everything, but honestly, I didn’t expect it to prove this useful. And it wasn’t like I hadn’t learned anything about the demon that masterminded the incident either. I was informed that he was some sort of fiend. Analyze did tell me the race’s full name, but it was too long so I’d forgotten exactly what it was. But either way, the fact that he was a fiend meant that he was indeed a demon.His skills included Brainwashing and Necromancy. There was also a whole bunch of other stuff that made him seem like a fairly effective spy. His skill page alone was, in fact, enough to determine that he was the type to engage in devious ploys.Apparently, the demon had come into the prince’s service as a minister several years ago and the two had been seen working together quite often ever since. Which means he probably slowly brainwashed him over time, and then used necromancy to turn him into a literal puppet when he felt like it was time to put the icing on the cake. In other words, the prince most likely hadn’t actually sent troops our way just because he happened to be greedy and ambitious. Chances were, the demon had wanted the humans to bother Lefi so she would return the favour by completely obliterating the country in retaliation. It fit well with the whole destroying the country from the inside out thing that he had going on given his whole two-factioned civil war and whatnot, but it wasn’t exactly the type of plan I could approve of. What the hell. Lefi isn’t a tool. You can’t just use her to kill people goddammit. I’ll not forget this, demon. I’ll remember everything you’ve done and pay you back with interest. Just you wait.There was something about the whole puppet prince scenario that bothered me. It was the fact that it so closely resembled the scenario we’d run into back in that town in the sticks. But, unlike the fake minister, the overly suspicious ringleader I had captured back then was human. Their methods were the same, and so were their powers. The only difference between them were their races. There were far too many similarities for it to be a coincidence.Thinking back, the guy had asked me why a demon like me was interfering with his plan. I had taken it as him wondering why a demon would bother saving a human town, but the fresh perspective that this incident had brought me made me think that may not be the case. It could have been him asking why one of his supposed allies was getting in his way.It seemed that there was a group of humans that bore some sort of connection to a similarly minded group of demons. Of course, there was always the possibility that I was just making too much out of a coincidence, but I didn’t think so. Something was up. I just knew it. Ughhh… This is awful. Why the hell am I stuck thinking up conspiracies again? Y’know what? Screw this, I’m done. I love unravelling sinister plots like this when it comes to games and stuff, but doing it in real life is just a huge pain in the ass. So yeah, no. I’mma just call it a day and stop.I wanted to hurry back to the dungeon so I could kick back and relax. There’s no place like home. Home sweet home. Something happened to latch onto my waist right as I entertained the thought of ending my stay.“Mr. Hero!”Upon looking down, I found myself greeted by the princess’ smiling face, which prompted me to turn my gaze back towards her father.“I’m glad to see that she’s all better now.”
“As am I,” agreed the king. “Her health and glee are both a result of your efforts. You have my thanks.”The three of us were currently in a room without any guards or servants present. It was just me, the king, and his daughter. Our current situation was likely a result of the king showing me his consideration. He knew that I wouldn’t be able to speak without reserve otherwise. Just goes to show how much he trusts me, I guess. I mean, I get it. I literally saved you, but don’t you think you’re being a bit too careless? Not that I mind, since it makes my life easier, but you know.“Mr. Hero, Mr. Hero!” The princess looked up excitedly as she called for me.
“What’s up?”
“Why are you wearing that mask?”
“Well, princess…”
“Can you please call me by my name instead?”
“Uhhhh… sure, I guess? What is it?”
“Iryll!”
“Errr. Alright, Iryll. Anyways, you see, I’m not actually a hero. I’m an evil demon lord, one chock full of malicious intent. Wearing this mask is my way of making sure no one finds out. See these wings? Aren’t they just terrifying?” I materialized both pairs of wings while speaking in a sinister tone, just to scare her. I could tell that she was starting to get attached to me, and for some odd reason, my sixth sense was practically screaming at me. I could feel chills running down my spine. They were telling me that letting it happen was a bad idea, and that I should avoid it at all costs.But for some odd reason, my plan totally backfired.“Wow!” The girl’s eyes began to sparkle as she looked upon my demonic features. “They’re awesome! You’re really cool Mr. Heroic Demon Lord!”Welp. Sorry sixth sense. I think I just fucked up.“So, if you’re a Demon Lord, does that mean you’re going to kidnap me?”
“Huh? What? Why would I?”
“Because that’s what the demon lords always do in stories!” said the princess enthusiastically.
“Uh huh…”
“So please do exactly that and kidnap me!”
“Err… uhh… Suuuuuuure, if I ever feel like it, I guess.”
“Yay! I can’t wait!”I smiled awkwardly before turning back towards the king.“So uhhh, yeah, you might want to stop grinning like a moron and do something about this daughter of yours. She’s at risk of being kidnapped by an evil demon lord, y’know?”
“Why, that’s terrible.” The king laughed in an over dramatic manner. “I suppose I should prepare a handkerchief so that I may weep as I watch you “forcibly” take her hand.”Bruh, what the hell!?<– Prev — Next –>

A Discussion in a Private Room
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Now now, Iryll. I’m sure you would love to continue being in his company, but this isn’t quite the time for it.” The king, who’d spent a good bit of time happily smiling as he watched me interact with his daughter, spoke in an admonishing tone. “The two of us have business to attend to. Could you please wait in another room?”
“Of course, father.” Iryll responded in a polite manner one would expect of a princess before turning back towards me and completely dropping it. “I guess that means I gotta go! See you later, Mr. Demon Lord!”She continued to rapidly alternate between her more polite and casual modes. Iryll performed a polite curtsy, pitter-pattered over to the door, waved energetically, and closed it behind her.As could be grasped from her words, the nickname she had ultimately decided on giving me was “Mr. Demon Lord.” There were a number of other contenders, many of which included the word heroic, but she had ultimately dropped it and just called me by what I was.“I am overjoyed to see her in such high spirits,” the king spoke in a low tone of voice as he watched her go.
“Yeah. Honestly, I’m surprised she’s like that,” I said. “Acting like that takes guts with all she’s been through.”The princess had been subject to torture at the hands of a perverted sadist. I highly doubted that any normal child would ever be able to smile again after suffering at the aforementioned pedophile’s hands. And yet, despite her experiences, Iryll had almost seemed like a ball of joy. Talk about mental fortitude.“I must express my gratitude to you once more,” said the king, his voice filled with emotion. “You are the sole reason that my daughter was not robbed of her smile. And for that, I thank you.”
“Don’t mention it. Like I said, I wasn’t there ‘cause I wanted to help or anything.” I shrugged. “I was just taking care of business.”
“That does not change my stance on the matter.” The king shrugged off my indifference. “You have saved my country. I suppose that I must offer you something akin to a token of my gratitude. Is there anything you wish for? I will endeavour to accommodate your desires so long as I find myself capable.”
“Hmmm. I dunno.”I hadn’t saved the king because I had wanted anything in particular. My goal, murdering the prince, was complete. And that was honestly all I really cared for. The king owes me big time. It’s probably safe to say that I won’t be bothered by any more of this country’s men so long as he stays in power. Not like there’s any reason for them to hit up the Wicked Forest anyway. They’re afraid of Lefi, and they know that place is her nest. We should be able to enjoy a good bit of peace so long as there aren’t any more conspiracies. Y’know what though? I might as well get me some insurance.“Alright. Well, all I want is for intruders to stay the hell out of my territory. So how about you tell people that the deeper part of the Wicked Forest is off limits? I don’t mind if they enter it, but only if they don’t wander too far in”Adventurers had explored the area near the forest’s edge on several occasions. And I was fine with that. The only people I had a problem with were the people that ignored the invisible boundaries set by adventurers and dove straight into the Wicked Forest’s depths.“Consider it done,” said the king. “Truth be told, your request merits little change. The Wicked Forest has always been considered a place far outside the reach of human hands. To accommodate your request, however, I will see to the creation of documents stating that none should intrude upon it and violate your domain unless they wish to forfeit their lives.”
“I mean, works for me, but you sure you want to make it official? Can’t say I think it’s the best idea.” I asked the king for confirmation while raising an eyebrow.Putting it into writing meant that the king and I would have created a formal contract, a fact that would likely prove problematic. Of course, it wasn’t as if either of us intended on violating the contract’s terms. It was just that I was a demon lord, a breed of creatures known for being hostile not only to humans, but most other races as well. His decision would likely result in others calling his character into question should it ever become known to the public.“That is not an issue. The document will remain highly classified and only accessible by those with royal blood,” said the king. “If anything, I suppose I should be the one asking you whether or not you are certain. I believe that a large portion of the Wicked Forest falls under the Supreme Dragon’s jurisdiction. I understand that you are a force to be reckoned with, but I suspect it may very well eliminate you should you intrude upon its nest.”
“Nah, it’ll be fine. Me and the Supreme Dragon know each other. We’ve already talked about it and figured things out.”‘Cause, you know, she kinda lazes around my place all day. I had actually spoken to Lefi about the topic in the past, and she’d told me that she did in fact have a nest at one point in time, but that she had effectively abandoned it and given me the whole area. With the king’s new policy in place, the Wicked Forest’s inner sanctum truly became mine, both in name and otherwise.That said, the dungeon had yet to absorb the entirety of Lefi’s territory. There were still a few pieces of it here and there that lay outside the realm of my control. I guess me and Rir can go around adding more area to the dungeon for the first time in a long while once we get back. Er, after I grind a few levels, that is.“You are acquainted with the Supreme Dragon…?” The king cocked an eyebrow. “I would think that claim to be one spoken in jest if it had come from anyone but you. But given your place of residence, I suppose I find it believable enough. Very well, if you have no qualms or complaints, then I see no reason for me to have any either. I will have all the documents in order shortly. Is that all?”
“Uhhhh let’s see… you guys got like travel authorizations or anything? I like to go sightseeing, so I would like some sort of document that can allow me to go around the country and visit wherever. You know, for vacation and stuff,” I said. Like a free pass or something. That’d be nice.It wasn’t like I didn’t have an ID card. I’d gotten something back when I registered as an adventurer, but I figured that whatever the king would give me would likely prove far more convenient in the long run. It would be much easier for me to take the dungeon’s residents into town if I happened to have something with a royal seal on it.“That is quite the interesting request,” said the king. “I would not mind providing you with one, but I cannot say that it will necessarily function the way you hope. Humans and demons have been at war for a long, long time. A mutual dislike is all but ingrained in our upbringings, and though I am this country’s king, I cannot guarantee that you will not be attacked if you reveal your identity.”
“Yeah, I figured. It should be fine though. I’ve got my methods,” I said. “I won’t be causing any trouble.”I wasn’t making an empty claim. Case in point, the church. The church had yet to realize that I was a demon despite the fact that I had spent a decent amount of time in the company of its members. My methods worked. I could disguise myself as a human with ease. However, the same couldn’t be said for Illuna, Shii, or the maids. My experiences indicated that people would actively employ enchanted items in order to check the races of those around them. I guess I’ll need to think of some kind of workaround.The goal was to bring everyone so that we could all enjoy our vacation together. Especially Illuna and Shii. I want to give the two of them a chance to see the world. Though uhhhh… I’m not exactly sure if I can do all that much to help Shii out though. She’s kinda, you know, blue. Oh well, whatever. I’ll figure something out eventually.“If you say so,” said the king. “I suppose I will have that prepared for you shortly as well.”
“Sweet. Thanks. How long do you think it’ll take?”
“I will have it ready in approximately an hour.” The king paused for a moment and regarded me with evident disappointment. “Were you planning to leave immediately? I would have liked for you to stay for dinner, at the very least.”
“I mean, I appreciate the sentiment, but truth be told, I’ve got someone waiting for me outside the city’s walls, and I probably shouldn’t just leave him there.”
“I see no reason why I shouldn’t extend that companion of yours an invitation as well.”
“Well uhhh… you see, about that… It’s kinda my pet wolf,” I said. “Well, kinda. He’s not really a wolf. He’s a fenrir, and I’m pretty sure that you’d probably not want a fenrir in the castle. You know. Just sounds like that’d be pushing things a bit far.”
“Well… putting the fact that you so casually mentioned keeping a legendary beast as a pet aside, I believe it shouldn’t cause any issues. Many adventurers are monster tamers and they are allowed to bring their beasts into cities so long as they register them beforehand.”
“Huhhh… fair enough.”I wanted to hurry back to the dungeon, but truth be told, I was kind of interested in taking a peek or two at the food. I mean, whoever’s responsible is literally going to be making stuff fit for a king, right? Can you really blame a guy for wondering what that stuff’s like?The king immediately caught onto the fact that I was entertaining the thought and followed up his assault by playing a card he’d held onto just to put the nail in the coffin.“I suspect that some may begin to call my dignity into question should I send the country’s saviour home without any sort of formal celebration. And that may in turn lead them to question my right to rule. I am sure you would prefer for that not to occur,” said the king. “And more importantly, Iryll has been looking forward to it. I am sure that she would be rather saddened if you chose not to attend.”
“Did you seriously just call me the country’s saviour? Talk about an over exaggeration…” I sighed. “Let me guess… you’re totally just trying to keep me here for your daughter’s sake, right?”
“I’m surprised you didn’t notice sooner,” chuckled the king. “Don’t worry. While it will be a feast, I will keep it on the smaller side and only invite a select few.”
“Alright. Fine. I guess I’ll stay for dinner.” I flashed a wry smile as I gave in and responded with a nod.<– Prev — Next –>

Dinner
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerI stepped outside the city’s gates after I spoke with the king. My goal was, of course, to pick up Rir so we could attend tonight’s party together. Once I found him, I had him shrink down so he was about the size of a normal wolf before heading back towards the capital. And while our attempt at entry still did cause a little bit of a stir, it went much more smoothly than I had originally anticipated. The king had sent one of his butlers, and the white-haired veteran of the service industry had vouched for us in order to ensure that we weren’t subject to too much hassle. He then showed us to a carriage which took all three of us back to the castle.“So this is how a fenrir looks? He is much smaller than I had anticipated.”
“What a cute little wolf!”The father-daughter pair took turns voicing their opinions on my companion. They were basically asking for it, so I had him revert to his usual size. His body inflated and his limbs extended before their very eyes. It only took him a few seconds to manifest in his original form. The soldiers nearby freaked out and immediately raised their weapons, but they soon heaved sighs of relief and lowered their weapons when they saw the registration tag he was wearing on the magical self-adjusting collar I’d given him. Whoops. My bad, guard dudes.“H-how fearsome!” The king blinked a few times as he stared down Rir in all his glory. His voice was coloured with shock, awe, and a tiny bit of terror. “I must admit that he now appears much more in line with my expectations.”
“Wow! The wolf was so cute! And now it’s so cool!”The princess’ reaction was only emphasized by the way it contrasted her father’s. She wasn’t scared at all. In fact, she immediately ran up to the large wolf, hugged one of his front legs, and buried her face in his fur. So why are kids never afraid of Rir anyway? Illuna acted pretty much the same way when she first met him. Like, dude, I’d be totally freaked out if I suddenly encountered a wolf that big.And so, time passed and the evening soon found itself upon us.We were shown to a room in the castle that overlooked the rest of the capital city.“Woah. Now this is what I call one hell of a view,” I said.
“Mhm. Sure is,” agreed the hero.We were standing by one of the windows and staring at the beautiful scenery that was laid out beneath us. It was dark out, but the cityscape almost seemed to be enhanced by the fact that the sun had fallen. The way the streets were illuminated by firelight was so breathtaking that I’d almost wanted to call it illusory.The scenery around my castle was a bit too dreary to be called picturesque. I mean, it’s not THAT far behind. It’s just, you know, a tiny bit worse. Just a tiny bit. I mean, there kinda isn’t a town or anything in the dungeon, so it can’t really be helped, but I’m not about to just sit around and let myself lose. I’ll see if I can fix up something or another once I get home.As promised, the king had kept tonight’s party on the smaller side. The only people invited were me, the king, his daughter, Nell, and Carlotta. Rir was technically on the guest list as well, but he wasn’t celebrating with the rest of us. Instead, he lay sprawled out on the balcony. I could tell that it was an act of consideration. He had chosen to isolate himself as to avoid getting in the way of our fun. Man, he sure has one helluva sense of delicacy. If he was human, he’d probably be the kind of guy that gets swarmed by chicks.In other words, maids-cum-waitresses aside, the only individuals present were either members of the royal family or individuals that had played a major role in their rescue. The other individuals involved in the operation were apparently going to be rewarded with another, larger banquet in the near future. Something on that kind of scale sounds pretty fun in its own right.“Thank you very much for your consideration and your kind invitation, Your Majesty. I appreciate the opportunity to join you on this fine evening.” Carlotta approached the king and began adulting.
“And as do I,” said the king. “But enough with the formalities. You and your companions are my saviours, and this feast is one that I have organised to celebrate your accomplishments. I suggest loosening up and breaking rank. I am certain that you will enjoy tonight’s meal much more if you relax.”
“Yes, sir. Thank you once again for your kindness and consideration.”“Right this way Mr. Demon Lord! You too Nell!” The princess grabbed both the hero and I by the hand and led us to our seats as her father engaged Carlotta in conversation.
“Thank you very much, Princess Iryll.” The hero offered the little lady her gratitude before turning towards me and speaking in a hushed tone. “Hey uhm… Yuki?”
“What?” I responded in kind and spoke at a volume that disallowed everyone but her from hearing my voice.
“She’s calling you a demon lord. Does that mean she found out?”
“More or less, yeah. But don’t worry about it. She’s still just a kid, so I doubt they’ll think much of it,” I said. “And is it just me, or do you two know each other?”
“Mhm. We do.” Nell nodded. “I know I might not look or really act the part, but I am still a hero. We’ve actually met several times.”Once everyone was seated, the maids got to work. They brought out all the food that had been prepared and laid it in front of us.“That… looks really good,” I said.
“Y-Yeah, it does,” agreed Nell. “I-I don’t think I’ve ever had anything this fancy before.”Both of us ended up gawking as we gave our impressions. And it wasn’t just because of how good the food looked. The smell was mouth-watering. Even just the slightest whiff of it was enough to make me want to stuff my face. Fortunately, we didn’t have to bother with all the formalities that accompanied a full-course meal. The format was more akin to a buffet than anything else. Casual is best.“Everything we’re having today was made by our finest chefs.” The princess reacted to our compliments with a giggle and proudly stuck out her chest as she boasted. “And we’re really really proud of them!”The king looked over the table once the maids had withdrawn and made sure that everything was in place. He double checked that everyone other than the princess, who had been given grape juice, had a glass of wine beside them before he started to speak.“I must thank you all for rescuing my daughter and I from our predicament. Though it may only be a humble offering, I would like for you to enjoy this banquet as an expression of my gratitude. Please, help yourselves. Enjoy yourselves to your hearts’ content. Now, without further ado, let us raise our glasses in celebration of your outstanding achievements. Cheers!”“Cheers!” Everyone present echoed the king’s final word.There was a clinking of glasses, and then, we all began to drink. Warmth began spreading throughout my body the moment the alcohol made its way down my throat. Whew! That hits the spot!I wasn’t enough of an oenophile to be able to really tell the subtle differences between two similar wines. I had just never been that much of a drinker. And yet, a sip was all I needed to understand that whatever the king had served us was of a particularly high quality. The grape-based drink had gone down so smoothly that I found myself thinking that I would have no issues drinking it until I dropped.Likewise, a single sip had led the hero sitting beside me to find herself enchanted. Wait a second. There’s no way she’s 20. Why the hell is she drinking like it’s nobody’s business? Er, oh wait, right. This isn’t Japan. Hell, it’s literally a whole other world. There might not even be any legal drinking-age restrictions here.“This is quite a fine wine,” said Carlotta. “Might this be from Thunderjew?”She had evaluated the drink with just a single taste of it, and started discussing particulars with the king. Well, I mean she does seem like she’s pretty high up the church’s corporate ladder. The fact that she’s fairly well versed in this kinda stuff doesn’t really surprise me.The king noticed that we seemed to be enjoying our drinks, so he immediately reacted by informing us that he’d allow each of us to take a few bottles home. It was an offer I gratefully accepted. I was looking forward to treating Lefi and the maids to the stuff once I got back. Especially Lefi. I can’t wait to see what she’s like when she’s blackout drunk.We each thanked the king for his generosity in turn, and then began digging into the food that had been heaped up before us.The night had turned out to be a pretty fun one. And it seemed like it would stay that way. We talked, enjoyed our booze, and ate whatever we liked. It was fun. I had a great time. But then, it happened.Everyone, and I mean everyone, started getting too drunk for their own good.***“Heeeey Yuki. How mwuch have you had to dwink? That’s right! Not enough!” The hero giggled as she snuggled up against one of my arms and started topping off my glass with a nearby bottle. “Don worree. I’ll fill that cwup of yours wight back ahp so you can get bach to dwinking. Bottoms ahp!”
“Thanks but no thanks. That’s enough! God damn it Nell, stop! It’s about to start spilling all over the place!”She kept pouring the bottle’s contents into my glass even though it contained far more liquid than one would normally put in it. In fact, it was filled to the brim, and she showed no signs of stopping, so I had to wrench the bottle out of her hands.“Hokay Yuki, I’m going to make shure you dwink it all. Open wiiiide.” I didn’t comply, so she started to pout. “Geez, you’re so shelfish. I guess I’ll haff to make shure it gets down your thwoat myshelf.”
“Holy shit, chill out! You’re getting way too close for comfort!” The hero’s lips had started closing in on mine at a rapid pace, so I grabbed the glass from her and stuck it between us. “Look, alright, I get it. I’ll keep drinking, so lay off already!”Given no other choice, I downed the entire glass in a single breath. Eugh… My stomach is on fire.“Gweat!” the hero giggled. “Nwow dat you’ve dwank, you gottah eet.” She picked up something with a fork and started shoving it towards me. “Opehn wide!”
“Hold on! Hold! On! That’s not even my mouth goddammit!”The hero had started shoving the utensil into the side of my face, so I unwillingly turned my head, opened my mouth, and allowed her to feed me.“Good wight? Now here’s anohther!” Open wide!”
“God. Damn. It. Knock it off already! You’ve clearly had way too much booze for your own good! You’re goddamn drunk!”The quality of the wine had caused the hero to get carried away and drink way too much way too quickly. She was so hammered, in fact, that she had lost the ability to speak like a normal person. Apparently, she was the type of drunk that liked to stick to others and “pamper” them. Admittedly, the way she was doing it did have its own sort of appeal. It was sexy. She had totally entangled herself around my arm. However, I didn’t find myself victim to her charms. In fact, it was the opposite. I was annoyed to no end.I also drank a fair bit of wine myself. Rather, the more accurate statement would be to say that I had been forced to drink it. But whatever the case, I had managed to hang on and remain tipsy at worst. That said, I highly doubted that would continue to be the case if the hero kept forcing the stuff on me.To reiterate, everyone was drunk. The hero wasn’t the only person completely out of their minds. The princess was too.“You smell so good Mr. Demon Lord! So, so good! So, so, so, so good!” She had parked herself on my lap and started nuzzling her face against my chest for god knows how long. Is she trying to mark me or something? Wait, when the hell did she get drunk!?The princess being drunk was fact. Though I had thought that she was being served nothing but juice, it turned out I was wrong. She too reeked of the smell of alcohol.I looked over at the king, who had been regarding the situation with a shit-eating grin, evidently for the sole reason that it wasn’t his problem. I could only sigh as I found a stream of z’s coming from the old man. When the hell did he pass out!? I could swear he was still laughing his ass off just a second ago.I mean, I get it dude. You’re tired, and a lot has happened lately. But I mean, just saying, isn’t the host supposed to, you know, not clock the fuck out in the middle of the party? I had lost my ability to see the king in any sort of regal light. To me, he was no longer anything but another overworked, middle-aged father. Good luck, bro.Scanning my surroundings had led me to realize that we were short a person, so I looked around only to realize that the missing knight had joined Rir on the balcony.“Ahhhh… you’re so softttt… so so soft… What do you say? Want to come be my pet? I’ll give you all the headpats you could ever want… You’re just so soft and comfy…”Carlotta was the one person that I hadn’t expected to be drunk beyond salvation. And yet, she too had lost all semblance of time and place. Her face was buried in Rir’s flank, and she was running her fingers through his fur without a care in the world.Fluffrir noticed my gaze and looked over at me as if pleading for help. My response was to immediately avert my gaze and pretend that I had seen nothing. Sorry man… I’ve kinda got my hands full already.“Mmrph! What the hweck!” The hero puffed up her cheeks and sulked. “You’re naht supposed to lwook away in the middwe of dinner! Now open wide swo I can punish you!”“Mr. Demon Lord, Mr. Demon Lord! You smell so good! So, so good!”God. Fucking. Damn. It. Why did this stupid party have to end up being nothing but pure, unadultered chaos!?***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. I know, I know, it’s been a while since I last talked to y’all, but I didn’t want to flood all the chapters Boss Young’un pushed on us with my notes, so I held myself back. That plus the fact that I couldn’t get my scripts finished in time for the next chapter. But now that Boss has calmed down some, I can finally get back to what I do best: Entertaining the masses by praddling on about inane nonsense that no one really cares about. Woo! But I know why you guys are really here. You want your names to show up in the chapter itself, don’t you? All right, all right. Let me get my bulging sack… We’ve got 5 in chapter 106 and 1 in chapter 107, so thanks to Tonatsi, Teru, AntsCool, Confusing thingy, and Jasonofwolves! (Tonatsi posted two questions in 106, that’s why the count is off. Yes, strangely enough, I can count) Remember, if you’d like your name in the chapter and your questions answered, leave them below with the hashtag #AskJoker, or if you want to give Nirvash a headpat, go with the hashtag #NirvashHeadPat and she’ll thank you with a smile! ^^ See y’all in the next chapter, where next time, Yuki is going to have to deal with quite a few hungover people, I bet. Can’t wait!<– Prev — Next –>

A Night in the Capital
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“My lord…” I leaned back into my chair and heaved a heavy sigh shortly after having someone pick up the princess, who had fallen asleep in my lap. I had entrusted her to one of the maids that had been watching over the entire dinner party with a smile.Unlike the maid, I had the exact opposite of a smile on my face. The awful drunk of a hero had forced me to drink way more than I wanted. I simply could not remember the last time I had ever ingested that much alcohol in one sitting. Fortunately, my overpowered body was one that was able to tolerate copious amounts of booze, as I never ended up vomiting. That said, I wasn’t all that comfortable either. I could practically feel the liquid sloshing around within my guts. Man. Today has just been chock full of me being glad I’m not just another human anymore, hasn’t it? First, there was that whole battle freak fiasco, and now there’s this. Seriously. I can’t thank the dungeon enough for depriving me of my humanity.The source of all my bowel-related discomfort, the hero, was sound asleep. She had remained glued to me throughout the evening, and had continued leaning on me even after dozing off. You know, now that all the booze is gone, she really does look like just another cute girl. Her body is incredibly soft. She looks real innocent in her sleep too. Looking at her now, I almost can’t imagine her as the terrifying drunk that forced me to guzzle a copious amount of wine.Recalling the incident filled me with a sense of annoyance. I was so angry that I probably would have started doodling all over her face if I happened to have a pen.“I mean, I do have a permanent marker on hand, but, you know what, I’ll be nice and let you off the hook. This time.” I muttered a few words under my breath with a smile before getting up. I made sure to carefully adjust the hero’s position and make sure she was propped up against the chair well enough not to fall over. “Time to go, Rir.”Although my companion had remained in his regular form whilst camping out on the balcony, he was currently the same size as any other wolf. It was the smallest he could get. The reason for the change was because he had wanted to retreat under the table and use my legs to take shelter from everyone that had wanted to pet him. (Read: Carlotta.)He knew exactly what I meant, so he stretched and got ready to go.“Would you happen to require my assistance with anything?” One of the maids standing nearby approached in order to check on me.
“Nah, I’m good. I was just thinking of heading home,” I said. “Actually, on second thought, could you do me a favour and tell the king that I had a great time?”The aforementioned monarch had ended up doing more than just passing out. He had transitioned from a booze snooze to a rather deep sleep halfway through the party. One of the butlers who had realized this bowed to all the guests and apologized before escorting him elsewhere. Likely his bedroom. I was pretty much the only one still even remotely sober when it happened though.“It’s rather late,” said the maid. “Would you like me to show you to a room instead? You’re more than welcome to stay the night.”
“Thanks, but I’ll pass. I told myself I was going to go home today, so I’mma do just that.”I had the sneaking suspicion that staying the night would ultimately result in a much longer stay than just that. The princess would probably end up trying to keep me detained for as long as she could. And as someone from Japan, I wasn’t all that great at saying no.“Understood,” said the maid. “Would you like me to assist you in preparing a carriage that will take you all the way to the city’s gates?”
“Nah.” I was planning to get on Rir since he was faster, so I declined.“Going home already, Masquerade?” Someone called out to me just as I was about to have the maid show me the way back out of the castle.Glancing over, I found that it was Carlotta, who had been asleep with her arms crossed and her back against one of the sofas in the corner of the room until just a moment ago. I guess the noise must have woken her. She is a soldier, so I doubt she’s that deep of a sleeper even if she’s all drugged up on booze.“Yeah. Thanks for everything,” I said. “Oh, do me a favour, pass that message onto Nell for me once she wakes up.”
“Hmph. I should be the one thanking you. We couldn’t have completed the operation nearly as easily without you,” the knight snorted. “Feel free to ask if you ever need my help. The church would be glad to offer you our assistance at any time. And I’m sure Nell would be too.”
“I dunno about you, but that sounds like a sure-fire way for me to get myself recruited by the church.”
“Well, I am more or less saying that we’ll welcome you with open arms,” she said. “We do think pretty highly of you, after all.”I flashed her a wry grin, waved goodbye, and left the castle.***“Wait! Yuki!” Another voice called out to me right as the maid showed me outside. I turned around to see the hero chasing me down. Kind of. Her steps were unsteady, and she had a hand on her temple.
“Oh, hey Nell. You’re up already?”
“M-Mhm… But my head is killing me…”
“No surprise there. That’s kind of what happens when you drink too much.” I gave her a reproachful stare. “Speaking of which, you’re a terrible drunk.”
“Erk…” The girl’s face immediately flushed a shade of red.I guess that means she remembers all the flirting around she did.“U-Uhm… S-sorry…” she stammered. “I couldn’t help myself. I was really drunk, and it was just so much fun.”
“Yeah, whatever… “ I rolled my eyes. “You should really be more careful. I probably would have taken advantage of you if I wasn’t literally the embodiment of what it meant to be a gentleman.”
“Gentleman? Yeah, how about no,” said Nell. “And I know. I’d never let myself get that drunk around guys I don’t know or people I can’t relax around.”
“Are you saying you feel like you can relax around me?”
“I at least trust you enough to know that you won’t take advantage of me. Besides, even if you did, then all I’d have to do is go crying to Lefi,” said Nell triumphantly.
“Please don’t. The thought terrifies me.” I smiled awkwardly. “Well, hero, I guess this is goodbye. Thanks for everything. I know we didn’t hang out all that much, but I had tons of fun.”
“Me too. I really liked spending time with you. I’m kind of disappointed we already have to say goodbye,” she said. “But it’s not like we won’t ever see each other again, right?”
“You betcha. Feel free to stop by the dungeon and hang out whenever. You’ve got a free pass, and our doors are open for you anytime.”Nell paused for a moment.“Sure. I’ll definitely come visit,” she smiled. “I’ll be much more of a hero next time we see each other. I’ll be so strong I’ll make you shiver in your boots! So just you wait!”
“Sounds like a challenge. I can’t wait,” I laughed.I grinned and jumped on Rir, who had returned to his full size.“Oh yeah, that reminds me. Here, take this.” I opened my inventory and chucked an item at the hero.
“Huh? Wahhh!” She panicked and just barely managed to catch the sheathed dagger I had thrown her way. “What’s this…?”
“Just a little something I made. The whole crafting process went well and all, but I kinda can’t exactly use it myself.”
“It’s so pretty…” She stared in awe as the blade, which she had only drawn halfway, sparkled in the moonlight.If one were to analyze the blade, they would see the following.***
Lunar Blossom: A Dagger with a snow white blade created by a demon lord named Yuki. Swinging it during the night causes its glimmering blade to cleave through the darkness and leave a ray of moonlight in its wake.
Quality Rating: A+
***I had created Lunar Blossom not too long ago. It was back when I was messing with enchanted metals in order to determine their quirks. Specifically, it was made of adamantite. It was a wonderfully crafted item. Its quality was so high that it made me want to stand tall and proud. However, like I had mentioned, I didn’t exactly have any use for it.I already had several other knives that I used on a regular basis. And it wasn’t like I could use it in combat either. I was using Zaien as my main armament and the magical handgun as my secondary. I just didn’t need it. And that wasn’t even taking into account the fact that I was awful at handling blades. My Sword Mastery skill was still stuck at level 2.“It’s pretty sharp and pretty durable too. I was hoping that you’d keep it on hand as your spare weapon or use it to butcher monsters or something.”
“Thank you.” Nell sheathed the blade and hugged it to her chest. She then nodded with a beautiful smile that seemed indicative of the emotions she had kept bottled deep inside. “I promise I’ll take really good care of it.”
“Please do. Well, I guess I’ll be off now, Nell.”
“See you again, Yuki.”She waved goodbye as I rode Rir through the capital and melded into the darkness of the night.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Aww, looks like a certain hero is starting to fall for our resident Demon Lord. If that does happen, naturally Lefi would be the primary mate, Illuna would probably put up a fight for second, Shii might join in because it looks fun, and the maids… well, I’m not sure on the maids yet. We’ll see later down the line. But yeah, a Hero falling for a Demon Lord. I’m sure this will go over well in the church. Maybe some of the higher ups in the church will try and have Nell ‘silenced’, Carlotta will fight against it, and Yuki is going to have to intervene. I don’t know, that’s just what I’m guessing. Okay, let’s see… two letters in the bag today, plus… How many headpats?! 9?! And 6 of them from the same person?! Good golly, Miss Molly… I’ve never had that many letters before… I guess that’s the power of moe. How scary… So, um, anyway, thanks to HONEYBEE and kx for your letters, and kx, Tonatsi, Kisuli for the double headpat… not sure why you did me… and جهاد السعيدي. Strange name, and I’m not sure if it’ll show up, but I’m not judging. Nirvash thanks you for the headpats, and if you have a question you’d like to ask… or if you just want to headpat her some more… leave your comment, or headpat, below with the hashtag #AskJoker or #NirvashHeadPat. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Day in the Life of Reiyd Glorio Allysia
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Understood, Your Majesty. I suppose the next item I must call to your attention is the annual Conference of the Lords. Do you believe that we would do best to alter it in any which way?” One of the king’s most trusted retainers posed a question as he regarded his lord from the other side of an absurdly large stack of paper.
“Let us alter the schedule and have it occur earlier than originally planned.” King Reiyd Glorio Alyssia responded as he continued reading through the many documents sitting atop his desk. “Have Marquis Relga and Margrave Delogue arrested immediately if they so brazenly dare to attend. And if they do not, then march our men upon their gates and have them captured as rebels.”
“Of course, Your Majesty. I will have all the preparations put in order immediately,” replied the retainer. “What shall we do about the food situation? Though the rebel threat has passed, Alshir’s citizens are still in the midst of a crisis.”
“Take any funds you require from the royal family’s exchequer.” The king paused for a moment. “No, I rescind that command. This entire affair was ultimately a result of my incompetence. Take the funds from my personal coffers instead. Purchase food from any merchants that have it in stock and distribute it to the citizens alongside what has been confiscated by the army. Do ensure that you compensate any merchants who have suffered losses as a result of this fiasco. You may sell the castle’s furniture should you find that my personal wealth proves insufficient.”The king continued to read his documents after making the order but he soon felt that something was amiss and raised his head. Upon doing so, he found the retainer, his confidant and most trusted friend, regarding him with a grin. He was a long time friend, and he had been in the king’s service for longer than he had sat upon the throne. Their longstanding, trusting relationship meant that the man bore many an important duty.Over half the king’s supporters had either been killed or imprisoned when his son took over the castle by force. Reiyd was all but certain that his best friend had met an untimely demise. But much to his delight, the man had escaped his captors. Hearing the news had caused the king to think that there was happiness to be found even in misfortune.It turned out that the king’s confidant had done more than just evade capture. The church’s paladins had informed him that the man had remained on the run and stayed out of the eyes of the army in order to evade capture whilst also working towards the king’s benefit. It was he that had contacted the church and convinced every other group present that allying with the king was to their benefit. It was he that provided the holy knights with a detailed account of the events that had occurred within the castle’s walls. And it was he that had effectively put together all the necessary pieces to arrange for the king’s rescue.“What is it?” asked Reiyd.
“Nothing much,” replied his confidant. “I just happened to notice that you seem to be faring much better now. And I am quite glad to see it.”His words caused King Reiyd to smile wryly.“I did not have much of a choice. Do you not see this pile of documents? It would only have grown if I did not recover.”
“Looking at you as you are now, Your Majesty, I can say with certainty that it is more than just that. You seem to be filled with energy, as you once were in our younger days. As someone that has served you for quite a number of years, I daresay that the aura about you fills me with nostalgia.”
“Hmmm…”Reiyd brought a hand to his chin as he entertained a thought about his newfound energy’s origin. He was all but certain that it was thanks to none other than him.“Your Majesty?”
“Do not mind it, I merely happened to spend a moment lost in thought,” said the king. “I believe that was all we wished to discuss today. I would like you to begin without any further delay.”
“Right away, Your Majesty.”King Reiyd paused for a moment after watching his confidant leave. He used the breather to contemplate his recent experiences, to contemplate thoughts of the man that had appeared before him in the final moments of his imprisonment.The demon was quite the mysterious young man. He could very well have waited until after saving the king to reveal his identity. Doing so would have placed the king in his debt immediately and therefore allow him an advantage in negotiations. But he didn’t. He had taken a more straightforward approach and revealed both his identity and his goal immediately upon entering the stage.Humans and demons had a long history of war, one filled with strife and mutual resentment. The two groups continued to engage in combat to this day; small skirmishes could be found wherever they met. Discrimination and prejudice had only grown stronger in recent years. There had been an uprise in the number of radicals who preached a doctrine of human supremacy. And as a result, humans came to antagonize more than just the demons. They were now equally at odds with beastkin and demihumans.Reiyd’s imprisonment was, in a sense, linked to the aforementioned conflict. He wasn’t killed the moment he was captured because the party responsible had wanted him to divulge his knowledge of the country’s forbidden spell. The Kingdom of Allysia was founded in the distant past. As a nation that had survived many crises, it naturally had countermeasures in place. And the forbidden spell was one of its final lines of defense, one known only by members of the royal family. That was the reason the foul prison guard had interrogated him and attacked his daughter. It was all to make him crack. To get him to divulge his country’s most protected secret.That was when the demon had shown up. Normally, if one was to appear and offer salvation in such a scenario, the king would suspect that they wanted something, that they had a goal. And he would have asked the demon’s had he not caught a glimpse of the man’s eyes as he healed Reiyd’s daughter. Though the young man had been wearing a mask, Reiyd had recognized the look in his gaze as one filled with kindness.Seeing him like that made it very difficult for Reiyd to see him as a minion of the demonic legion that viewed the human race under a lens of hostility. The king instead chose to see the demon as just another young man, one that happened to have a soft spot for children. He chose to hear him out instead of dismissing his words. He chose to believe.And in the end, his choices had proven correct.The country would likely have fallen at the hands of those that wanted to see it in ruins had he not interfered. And even more harm would have come to Reiyd’s daughter. There was a chance that she would have been forever left with physical and mental scars alike, that she might have been hurt too badly to ever smile again.Likewise, King Reiyd would also have been left with scars in his heart. Because he never would have known what had truly happened to his son. The monarch’s mind would have remained clouded with doubt and disappointment until the moment he breathed his last.He felt a near endless amount of gratitude towards him, both as a king, and as a father. But of course, gratitude wasn’t all that there was. It wasn’t as if Reiyd thought nothing of demons as a whole. As the man that had manipulated Prince Riutt was a demon, he couldn’t possibly claim that he felt no hate for demonkind.That said, the king felt as if all the time he had spent disliking demons may very well soon come to an end. For there was another place he could direct his wrath. The demon that had manipulated his son had worn an enchanted pendant. Upon analyzing it, his court’s mages had reported that it was most likely a product manufactured by a major power to Allysia’s southeast: the Rogarde Empire.The Rogarde Empire was regarded as one of the most influential and powerful countries that lay to the continent’s south. It was a human country, one headed by an emperor with a thirst for conquest. He had already engaged in many a war, and those that bordered him considered him a great threat. The question that Reiyd bore in mind was as follows: Why would a demon possess a magically enchanted item created by humans?He understood that it was possible that the demon had simply taken it from a corpse or extorted its owner. But it was just as possible that it was something a human had willingly given the demon.There was a chance that the empire had begun to work hand in hand with demons.Allysia was a large country. It was powerful enough to ward off the empire’s attempts at invasion because their militaries were at an equilibrium. However, that would no longer continue to be the case should the kingdom collapse from the inside out. Reiyd knew that the empire would happily gobble up his territory if the equilibrium collapsed.Similarly, the demons would also love to see Allysia fall. The magic items that Reiyd’s country produced were crucial to the Anti-Demon Alliance and its operations. If it were to fall, then the demons would no longer feel nearly as much pressure from humanity’s forces. Just like the empire, they too would only see benefit from his country’s demise.The imperials, like most other human nations, were also supposed to be at war with the demons. Reiyd found it difficult to imagine the two working together under the table. But it was his duty to bear the weight of an entire country on his shoulders; he had to consider the worst-case scenario.He needed to prepare a means of defense, a means adequate enough to protect those that inhabited his country from those who wished it harm.“Acquainting myself with him was truly quite a stroke of luck,” Reiyd muttered.The future looked grim. Meeting such a kind hearted and powerful individual just as danger appeared on the horizon was, to the king, nothing short of a godsend. Because it provided him with ease of mind. He knew now that his daughter would be safe even if the worst came to pass.All he had to do was send her his way. He knew for a fact that Iryll wouldn’t be turned away, that the demon lord would take her in and protect her. Of course, Reiyd knew that such an act was precisely what it meant to take advantage of the other man’s goodwill. And it did make him feel rather guilty, but it was the only way he knew to keep her safe.Fortunately, his daughter seemed to have taken quite favourably to him as well. He was sure that, if she were to take up residence with him, she would be able to spend her days in blissful peace.And that was all he wanted. The only thing he desired was for his daughter to grow up happy and healthy.“I pray that he and I may remain good neighbors to one another from now on…”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, so that’s a glimpse into the mind of a king. Pretty heavy stuff, I must admit. Having to think about all this different stuff, plus the forest worth of paperwork you have to do on a daily basis when all you want to do is be a good father to your daughter? Pretty heavy stuff, man. Pretty heavy stuff…. Well, like I mentioned earlier, when boss shoves out loads of chapters in quick succession, it doesn’t give me much time to write down notes for the next session of my segment, but that’s okay. I know that all of you guys come here for the chapter, not to read about me droning on and on. We got 3 letters and 3 headpats today, so thanks to zekkendo (Sorry about ducking your question, I’m just a practical kind of person), Yashuul, and Tonatsi for your letters, and Nirvash thanks جهاد السعيدي, Tonatsi, and wisler01 for the headpats. If you have a question you’d like to ask… or if you just want to headpat her some more… leave your comment, or headpat, below with the hashtag #AskJoker or #NirvashHeadPat.

Home Sweet Home
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“I’m finally home…” I muttered a few words to no one in particular as I basked in the sunlight. It was just past noon, the time the star was shining its brightest. I couldn’t help but relish in the warmth of its rays as I regarded the ever familiar cave before me.Not having to account for Nell meant that Rir didn’t have to show restraint. He was able to dash home at his top speed. Still, the trip had still taken longer than expected—and not because I had decided to nap on his back as he ran. Our lateness could be attributed entirely to the sudden introduction of a few necessary miscellaneous tasks. All of which stemmed from an encounter with a group of bandits.They had attacked us on sight, so I returned the favour by wiping them out. I followed up the extermination by hitting up their base, snatching all their loot, and then burning their whole damned operation to the ground. Huh. You know, in retrospect, I almost feel like my actions were just as heinous and criminal as theirs. But hey, I did check their titles ahead of time just in case. The result? Yeah, let’s just say that their kind doesn’t deserve any pity. And I am supposedly the Demon Lord of Judgement. Convicting sinners of their crimes and punishing them accordingly is basically my job, at least according to the title. So yeah, whatever, fuck it. Not my problem. Might as well just call it karma and move on.Although it was my first time doing anything of the sort in real life, I rather enjoyed the activity. Raiding bandit camps is fun, likely because their base of operations was an abandoned fortress. Clearing it out felt somewhat reminiscent of an old RPG. Beating up bandits was definitely worth my time. 10/10 would do it again if I had the chance. It’s a great way to grind money too. Not that I’ve got any use for money, but y’know.Oh, wait. On second thought, I do. I can totally just feed it to the dungeon. Man, I’ve been feeding it nothing but corpses, so I totally forgot. Might as well at least try doing that then, I guess. I might even make a whole bunch of DP if I’m lucky.Rir and I had already gone our separate ways, so I ended up getting lost in my own thoughts as I moved through the cave. I didn’t exactly feel like walking through the plains, so I switched the door’s destination to the true throne room before giving it a twist and walking right through.“I’m home.” The first thing I did after entering was announce my presence.
“Welcome home, Yuki!” Illuna dashed towards me the moment she noticed me and greeted me with a flying tackle that made use of all her momentum.
“Welcome back, Lord.” Shii was only a single step behind her. She too pitter-pattered towards me, but instead of jumping at me, she instead opted to slow down and wrap her arms around my waist.
“Thanks. I’m glad to see you guys doing so well.”I gave each of the two girls a few pats on the head. Man, seeing these two fills me right up with energy. Their smiles are the best medicine a weary soul could get.“Heya Master, welcome home!”
“Welcome home, My Lord.”
“Hey Lyuu. Thanks Leila.” I responded to the maids’ greetings in turn before finally turning towards the dungeon’s final resident. “Hey, Lefi. I’m back.”She had been looking right at me, so our eyes met the moment I directed my gaze towards her. For some odd reason, her cheeks immediately began turning a shade of crimson. She opened and closed her mouth a few times as if to say something, but she never managed to get it out. After a few tries, she gave up, and her expression ended up as one of indifference. Huh. That’s weird. What’s up with her?“I-Indeed you are. I must admit that I would have preferred for you to return sooner.” Lefi approached me and entered my personal space, which was more or less cluttered due to the two girls that had attached themselves to me, and grabbed a hold of my shirt before she continued speaking in a bashful tone. “T-The void you left by my side was filled with naught but loneliness. I-I missed you.”I. What. I. Huh? The dragon’s words had caught me completely off guard.“W-what the heck’s gotten into you? Are you okay? You aren’t sick, are you?”
“O-Of course not,” Lefi stuttered. “I am simply stating that I did not anticipate that your absence would cause me to suffer so.”
“Hwauht!?” The words that came out of Lefi’s mouth were so laced in sugar they led me to scream incoherently. W-What the hell has gotten into you, Lefi!? Seriously!The way the dragon girl was acting was so adorable I wanted to scoop her up in my arms, take her home, and ask if I could keep her. But as cute as it was, it felt… wrong. Something was off. She was acting so differently from the Lefi I knew that I almost didn’t want to think they were the same person. You know, this is almost like how animals end up acting all weird right before some sort of great calamity or something. Though in this case, Lefi herself could easily cause said great calamity, huh?I looked around the room in order to check whether I was the only person that felt as if something was off. And apparently, the answer was yes. Lyuu was watching us while pumping one of her fists, whereas Leila had an even bigger smile on her face than usual. Wait. Did they put some weird ass idea into her head or something? Because it sure as hell looks like it.I opened my mouth in order to question the two suspects, but Lefi interrupted me before I could speak.“Yuki…” Her nose twitched as she sniffed me.
“W-what?”
“Explain yourself. You bear the scent of a woman. What is the meaning of this!?”Oh shit! She knows! She totally knows!“B-Before you say anything, hear me out. I’m totally innocent!” I smashed the figurative not guilty button as hard as I possibly could as I stammered out an explanation. “Some kid got really attached to me so I played with her a bit. That’s all! And I mean it, she was just a kid! Barely any older than Illuna! And you can’t call someone that young a woman!”
“I see.” Lefi narrowed her eyes. “So you have once again laid hands on a child in order to appease your distorted desires.”
“That’s definitely not what I meant!”The supreme dragon wore a smile, a terrifying, dreadful smile. I could feel my brow dampening with cold sweat as I trembled in fear. Fortunately, her anger vanished as quickly as it had appeared.“…Very well. It matters not.” She calmed down and shook her head as she continued to speak. “Your journey must have left you exhausted. Have you had your midday meal?”
“I uh… no. Not yet.”
“Splendid. You must join us then. We were just about to start,” she smiled before turning towards the two little girls that had attached themselves to me. “I believe that is enough clinging for now. I am sure the two of you have had your fill, so let us assist in arranging the table.”
“Okay!”Both Illuna and Shii happily responded as they finally let go.“Be seated, Yuki. Lunch shall soon be served.”
“Errr, sure. Alright.”Lefi led me to the table and sat me down. She then followed the action with something that was nigh unprecedented. She went into the kitchen and grabbed a few plates in order to help set the table.“Seriously…” I muttered as I tried to wrap my head around the odd situation. “What the hell is going on…?”<– Prev — Next –>

Lefi’s Bizarre Behaviour
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerI had thought that Lefi might return to normal shortly after my return, but it didn’t happen. Case in point, right now.“Hold still. There is a speck of filth in your hair.” The dragon girl, who had approached upon noticing me, reached over and grabbed what looked like a piece of yarn from out of my hair.
“T-thanks. I didn’t even notice.”
“You are very welcome.”She casually sat herself down right next to me. She was so close that the two of us were basically touching. I tried not to pay her much mind as I continued transmuting weapons for the sake of boosting the skill’s level. But I couldn’t. The whole situation was just way too discomforting.And it wasn’t just because she was there. I was fine with that. The reason I was unable to focus was because the dragon girl did nothing but silently stare at me from up close.“Sooooo uh… Is there something on my face?” I broke the awkward silence by turning towards her.
“There is not,” she said. “W-would you prefer if I turned my gaze away?”
“N-Nah. I mean, I don’t really mind, it’s just… y’know, it makes me think something’s up.”Lefi had become much more clingy since my return. The most notable part was that the physical distance between us had shrunk by what felt like a full step. She would often position herself right beside me. I even felt as if we were almost always in physical contact, someway or another. Is it just me, or is it getting kinda warm in here?Unlike before, she leaned on me a hell of a lot, and she would even tug at the hem of my shirt whenever she needed me for anything. The whole shirt tugging bit was something that our resident vampire did often. On several occasions, I’d caught myself spinning around and expecting to see Illuna, only to find Lefi there instead.Though I had a bunch of different opinions on the matter, it wasn’t as if I thought negatively of Lefi’s newfound desire for physical contact. Men were creatures that loved how soft and wonderful girls like her were to the touch. And as a healthy male specimen, I was no exception. It’s just… how do I put this? The problem is that it feels like Lefi’s pushing herself real hard and forcing herself to do things outside her comfort zone.Her face was basically always red, and the way she spoke made it obvious that she was feeling awkward. She kept tripping over her own words, and even sounded stiff or nervous at times. And her being off ultimately ended up throwing me for a loop as well. I just didn’t know how I was supposed to react.Just to reiterate, it wasn’t as if I disliked the way she was acting. Hell, I would even go as far as to say that I found it adorable. But even with that said, I preferred Lefi’s usual self. It just wasn’t right for her not to be so brazen, shameless, or impudent. I really don’t want her to have to keep forcing herself to act like someone she isn’t. I really hope she gets back to normal sooner, rather than later…***“Soooo… Lyuu…” I said to the maid I’d arranged a meeting with. “You and I need to talk.”Her back was to the wall, so I took advantage of our relative positions and slammed one of my hands into the part of the wall right by her face. It was a classic Japanese technique often used by males that wanted to pressure their female counterparts into agreeing to things, often dates, that they otherwise wouldn’t.Of course, my intention wasn’t to create any sort of romantic tension. All I wanted to do was pressure her into speaking by blocking off all possible means of escape.“Eep!” She squealed at the impact before timidly turning her eyes upwards.”W-What is it Master? The way yer smilin’ right now is real scary.”
“Do you know why Lefi’s been acting so weird lately?”
“H-Huh? W-w-what are you talkin’ ‘bout? Lefi ain’t actin’ weird at all?” Lyuu responded, abnormally flustered.
“Alright, let’s get this straight. You think that’s normal?
“Come on Master. Lefi’s a girl too, y’know? And she’s just doin’ what girls do.”
“Lyuu, please.” I rolled my eyes. “Like, come on. All Lefi used to do all day was laze around in bed. She only ever got up to eat and play. You can’t just write off a sudden shift like that as something girls do. She’s been hella weird lately, and you know it!”Lyuu paused. She had run out of arguments. “W-Why are you askin’ me of all people anyway? I-I’m sure that Leila knows what’s goin’ on. She prolly knows way more, so whydda gotta pick on me!?”Welp. That’s Lyuu for you. She’s started selling out her buddies just because she’s run out of things to say.“Well, that’s just because I can’t really bring myself to put any pressure on Leila. She does good work.”Leila was nothing short of exceptional. She did more or less all the housework and even went above and beyond by teaching me about magic. I almost felt like I owed her for everything that she’d done for me.“B-but then why would you think it’s okay to pressure me!?”
“Because you’re an incompetent, sorry excuse for a maid that can’t even pull her own weight. Duh.”
“What the heck!? That’s somethin’ I’m really conscious of! You can’t just rub it in my face like that! You’re awful, Master! That’s totally discriminatory! You’re a tyrant, Master! A horrible, horrible tyrant!” Lyuu shouted indignantly. “Why can’t you be nicer to me, and y’know, treat me with more care ‘n respect!?”
“What are you, stupid? Of course I’m a tyrant. That’s just what demon lords are. I don’t know why you’d expect me to be anything else,” I flashed a wide grin. “And you want me to be nicer to you? Give me a break, I’m being nice enough already. Are you already forgetting that I’m the only reason Rir ever comes anywhere near you?”
“Erk… I-I mean yer right, but…”The warwolf could do nothing but respond with vexation.“And there goes your argument,” I smirked. “Right, anyway. Back to the whole Lefi thing. You mind explaining now, or what?”
“Ughhh… fine.” Lyuu finally seemed to realize that she wasn’t going to be able to worm her way out of divulging the details, so she reluctantly began to speak. “…I’ll tell ya, but y’can’t let anyone know that it was me that spilled the beans, ‘kay? Lefi’ll turn me to nothing but a pile o’ ashes if she ever finds out.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Don’t worry.”
“Lefi seems to be kinda worried ‘bout stuff,” began the beastkin.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Well, y’see…”Lyuu explained the details to me. To summarize, the source of Lefi’s distress was the fact that she had no idea how she was supposed to get closer to people. While it sounded like the type of problem a kid with few friends would have, I found it to be a surprisingly understandable concern. Lefi had always lived by herself. She had literally spent centuries without any real company. She had told me that the experiences I, or rather, we, brought her were fresh, new, and exciting. And that was what she had told Lyuu and Leila as well.She explained to them that she was enjoying life as it were, but she wasn’t sure if things could stay the way they were right now forever. Because she had never been the initiator. She felt as if everyone else was actively making attempts to grow closer with those around them, whereas she alone had put almost no effort towards the function. Her bonds were only what they were because of everyone else’s initiative. And that was the problem.Lefi had lived a long life, and experiences had taught her well. She knew that she couldn’t just take the things around her, relationships included, as granted. She knew that her bonds would one day fade unless she herself actively participated in strengthening them.The two maids had listened to her gripes whilst I was away in the capital. They found her worries adorable and enthusiastically began giving her all sorts of guidance and advice. Of course, I wasn’t privy to the exact details of what that advice entailed. Lyuu hadn’t told me that much.Either way, it meant that her current behaviour was basically her taking the maids’ advice and trying her best to roll with it.“Hah… I swear, Lefi…” I sighed before switching right over to my usual wry smile. You know, I can’t even say that she’s acting all that weird anymore. Like, now that I get it, I agree. She’s just being awkward and clumsy. As usual. I get what you’re trying to do now, Lefi, but you know what? You really don’t have to try that hard. You can just be you. But I get it. You’re trying because of how foreign the concept feels.You know what? I probably shouldn’t say too much to her. It’d probably be best for me to just keep nonchalantly playing along for now. I mean, I’m sure she’ll figure it out eventually. We’re going to be together for a long, long time, after all. But I might as well help her along where I can, right? Though, I guess I will at least tell her not to push herself too hard. Wouldn’t want things to go south just ‘cause she’s forcing it too hard. I guess I should probably help her blow off some steam or something just to make sure everything goes well. Oh, I know. I’ll treat her to the booze I got from the king. It’d probably be best if I did it sooner rather than later, huh? Hmmm. I guess today’ll work. Or tomorrow if it doesn’t.***“Whew…” Lyuu breathed a sigh of relief once her master was out of earshot. “Looks like I managed to trick ‘im.”Of course, it wasn’t as if everything she had told him had been a lie. It was true that her other master, the mistress of the house, was concerned about strengthening her bonds with other people. But it was a little more specific than just that.Her mistress wasn’t concerned about bonding with people in general. All she wanted was to get closer to another specific individual. Listening to her explain her concerns had left a bittersweet taste in Lyuu’s mouth. They sounded almost like the issues one would hear from the average girl that had just come of age.Though she had been pressured, there was no way Lyuu could possibly spare her master the undoctored details. Because she knew that the truth was something meant only for her mistress to tell.Lyuu giggled as she gave one of her fists a pump. “Do your best, Lefi! I know you can do it! Us maids’ll be cheerin’ you on from the sidelines!”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Aww, isn’t that adorable? Lefi’s trying to get close to Yuki and he’s being as blind as a bat about it. Can’t say I’m surprised. That’s about par for the course for most isekai protags. They don’t know love when it’s rubbing right up against them. But hopefully, Yuki’s Chuuni-Eye, I mean uh, Magic Eye, will see through Lefi’s attempts and give her the loving she wants. I’m personally still torn between Black Mage and Samurai, but I’m actually leaning more towards Samurai. And it makes me sad. Maybe I’ll try leveling both up. That’ll be more fun. So we got 3 questions and 2 headpats for me (For whatever reason…), and 11 headpats for Nirvash, so thanks to kx, Sylphian and Tup for your questions, Tonatsi and Anime Dragon for the headpats to me. Again, don’t know why you guys do that… and Nirvash would like to thank kx, جهاد السعيدي, Tonatsi, thedefend, Sylphian, Yashuul, and Anime Dragon. Remember, if you have a QUESTION for me, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker. If you want to headpat NIRVASH, put #NirvashHeadPat in the comments.

Sharing an Evening Drink
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerThat evening, Lefi and I found ourselves doing the usual. We sat cross legged and faced each other in front of a game board as we engaged in a battle of wits. By the usual, I meant the usual. Board games had become one of the dungeon’s staples, and we almost never passed on them before bed.“Hey Lefi.” I called out to the dragon girl as I got ready to enact Operation Help Lefi Relax. It was the perfect time for it. Illuna and Shii were asleep, and the maids had already retreated to their room for the night. “Do you drink?”The game we were playing was shogi, kind of. To be more exact, it was shogi with handicaps. I had chosen not to use either my bishop or my rook in order to even out the playing field. The whole situation made it sound like Lefi was bad at the game. And frankly, she was. But the dragon had come a long way from where she started. The handicap had been a lot more significant at first, as it had also included both my gold and silver generals.“That is a given. I would be surprised to hear of a dragon that does not.” said Lefi. “However, while I do enjoy the substance, I must admit that I prefer treats of a much sweeter variety.”
“Dragons love booze? That’s a shocker.”
“My race’s thirst for the substance runs so deep that some amongst us have been known to attack cities in order to acquire it and sate their thirst,” said Lefi, exasperated. “I believe it should come as no surprise that fools who know so little patience often meet their fate at the hands of those that they had wronged.”Welp. That’s karma for you. Can’t say you’d really deserve much else for causing a bunch of trouble just ‘cause you wanted booze.“I do find this sudden question of yours quite strange, Yuki.” Lefi stopped staring at the board and turned her eyes on me curiously. “I was under the impression that you disliked drinks of an alcoholic nature.”
“Nah. I mean, you’re kinda right. I’m not much of a drinker, but it’s not like I hate the stuff,” I said. “So anyway, you remember how I saved that king or whatever? He more or less rewarded me by giving me several bottles of this super high-class wine he happened to have. It’s pretty good, so I figured you might like some.”
“You say that the drink is so delicious that even you enjoyed it? Very well. I shall partake.”
“Alright. One glass of wine, coming right up.”I produced a pair of drinking glasses from my inventory alongside one of the bottles I had gotten from the king. A delicious mellow scent began drifting about the room the moment I popped off the cork.I poured a bit of wine into each of the two glasses and handed one to Lefi, who promptly raised it to her face and inhaled its alcoholic fumes.“It bears quite the fragrant scent,” she said.
“Right? Oh yeah, this stuff goes down your throat super easy, so make sure you keep track of how much you drink,” I said. “Unless you don’t mind being the first to get wasted.”
“You believe that you would be able to outdrink me? Preposterous!” Lefi’s face twisted into a dauntless grin. “Listen well, Yuki. Dragons are creatures known for their ability to consume copious amounts of alcohol. As the ruler that stands upon the species’ apex, I assure you that no such thing will happen.”
“Heh, bullshit. You know what we call that, Lefi? Overconfidence.” I returned her grin with a fearless smirk of my own. “And overconfidence is a poison. All it does is set you up for someone to turn the tables on you.”
“Hah. Run your mouth as much as you please. Soon, your defiance shall turn into submission,” she scoffed. “Very well. I shall tentatively believe your claims and hope to see that you live up to my expectations, Yuki.”
“Bring it on!” I cackled. “I’ll show you just what a demon lord can do.”The two of us raised our glasses and clinked them against each other before each taking a sip of the devil’s nectar.***“So uhhh…Lefi… you sure you’re okay? I dunno if drinking any more is exactly what I’d call a good idea.”
“Sheashe your pwaddoling. You need not be conshenred!” The dragon replied to my question in an adorable display of drunken rage. Her cheeks were dyed red, and her eyes were glossed over. Yet, she continued to drink. And even that action served to demonstrate just how drunk she was. Wine spilled out from the corners of her mouth. The way the excess liquid dribbled down her neck and ran down her chest was so erotic that I couldn’t deny its appeal.The Supreme Dragon was drunk. Dead drunk. Her head tottered to and fro as she spoke with a distorted lisp. Despite her claims, she had turned out to be a total lightweight. Er, actually that’s not quite right. I guess it’s more like she was more of a lightweight than I’d imagined, ‘cause she did technically have a lot.Lefi drank much less than Nell, but she did still have a bit more than what the average person would be able to handle. Wasn’t I supposed to be the one not living up to her expectations? Why’s it the other way around? What happened to dragons being heavy drinkers?I smiled wryly as I headed over to the kitchen and got her a glass of water.“Here, you might want to have some of this.”She took the glass from me and immediately drained its contents. She moved both it and the shogi board out of the way once she was done and then laid her head down in my lap. She was warm; I could feel the heat of her body through her thin nightgown.“What, giving up already?” I taunted.
“Of course not. What a ridiculous proposition,” said Lefi. “I am merely in the midst of a brief respite. I shall resume shortly.”Apparently, the water I gave her had caused her to sober up a bit. She no longer sounded like someone that had too much to drink.Truth be told, this same process had already happened several times already. She had repeated a cycle of getting hammered and sobering up, with both processes taking only a relatively short period of time. I mean, I guess the whole copious amounts of alcohol claim wasn’t all that wrong after all. She can technically drink a helluva a lot of booze in one night if she keeps this up. Just… maybe not all at once.I smiled at her, placed a hand on her head, and started running my fingers through her beautiful silver hair.“Hey, Lefi.”
“Mmn?” She responded to me with a groan as she adjusted herself to be a bit more comfortable.
“You’ve been pushing yourself pretty hard lately, huh?”
“I-I have not,” she turned her eyes upwards towards me as she answered. “W-Whatever are you talking about?”
“Come on. We’ve known each other for almost half a year now. You can’t fool me,” I said. “You’ve been acting hella different ever since I got back.”
“…”She kept silent, I kept talking.“I don’t know what you heard from Lyuu, Leila, or whoever, but you don’t really need to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Messing around with you is fun, and so is watching you do the things you enjoy. So you don’t have to try to act a certain way. You can just, you know, be you.”
“I am not… pushing myself outside my zone of comfort…” She averted her gaze and started to speak in a bit of a bashful tone. “I admit that I have done many things that even I may find peculiar as of late. They are things that I am not accustomed to, but they do not bring me discomfort.”Her face started to turn red.“I-I am frequently initiating physical contact, touching you, b-because discomfort is precisely the opposite of the emotion it dredges from within me,” she said. “I-I find myself longing for the comfort of your touch, Yuki.”Lefi’s skin, which was usually as white as a clean sheet of snow, had turned as red as a tomato. The look on her face was so adorable that it felt like my eyes were glued to her. I couldn’t take them off her face even if I tried.And as I stared, I could feel my heartrate begin to quicken.“The time for respite has ended.” Lefi got off my lap and crawled back over to her seat. “Cease with the silly expressions and provide me another bottle of wine. This one is empty.”
“S-Sure…” I realized that I had been enchanted by her charm and that I probably looked like an idiot, so I quickly tried to cover it up with a sigh of exasperation. “Wait. You want to drink more!?”
“Of course. And it follows without question that we shall also resume our game of shogi.”
“Alright, alright.” I turned towards the board as I spoke, only to find that something was wrong. “Wait a second! You totally spun the board around! And you’ve definitely moved a bunch of shit too!”
“I see not why you are accusing me of such foul play despite lacking the evidence to back your claim,” she said. “Or is this perhaps just another childish way for you to acknowledge your defeat?”Lefi’s face, which was still tinged in a slight shade of red, was covered by a triumphant grin.“Son of a…” I sighed as I grabbed another bottle of wine from my inventory. “Alright, you know what, fine. You’re on. We can call all this just another part of the handicap. I am that much better than you at this, after all.”And so, the two of us continued to hang out throughout the night, stopping to pass out only once we were both too drunk to function.<– Prev — Next –>

Bolstering the Dungeon’s Defenses
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix“Master, Lefi! Come on guys, rise ‘n shine, it’s already mornin’!”The first thing I heard as my consciousness slowly returned from the void was Lyuu’s voice. It was paired with a sense of motion. It felt like someone had grabbed me by the shoulders and tried to shake me awake.“Nrghhh…” The first thing I saw once I opened my eyes was the dog-eared maid’s face. She had a huge, shit-eating grin plastered all over it.
“Oh… hey Lyuu. Morning.”
“Good mornin’, Master,” she chirped. “I gotta say, seein’ this first thing in the mornin’ is a real sweet sight for sore eyes ‘cause it’s adorable ‘n all, but everyone’s gonna be up soon, so I think you two should prolly save the flirtin’ for later.”
“Huh…?” I was still barely awake, so I didn’t manage to fully process her words. I did however realize that there was a bit of a weight on my chest, so I directed my eyes downwards only to be greeted by a faceful of pretty silver hair and a pair of elegant looking horns.Following the silvery strands led me towards her neck. There, I saw both an exposed, well shaped collarbone and the smooth, unblemished skin that covered her nape. I felt the urge to stare, but managed to force my gaze just a bit further, where I witnessed a modest chest gently rise and fall as its owner breathed in and out.The sight was captivating. I couldn’t help but stare as I finally realized that, for some odd reason, I had embraced Lefi in my sleep. Wait. Huh? The fuck? How? When? What?I wasn’t the only one that Lyuu had awoken. The dragon girl in my arms began to stir because she too had been subject to a thorough shaking. She batted her long, pretty eyelashes a few times before finally opening her eyes and revealing the glimmer jewel-like pupils that lay within.She slowly, groggily raised her gaze in time with me lowering mine.And as our eyes met, we stopped.There was a moment of silence.We stared at each other, both too surprised to act or speak.“G-Good morning.” After a while, I managed to voice an awkward greeting.
“I-Indeed. I bid you good morning.”She reciprocated in an equally awkward manner. But neither of us knew exactly what we were supposed to say.There was another awkward pause.This time, Lefi was the one to break it.“Ummm… I wish to be released.”
“S-sure, my bad.”She rolled off of me as soon I lifted the arm that I had most likely wrapped around her in my sleep and slowly began to get up. Likewise, I shook off my sleepiness and raised my body now that I was no longer being weighed down. Alright. What the actual fuck happened last night?I surveyed our surroundings and realized that there were a large number of empty bottles rolling around us. Empty wine bottles, of course. Ughhhh. I drank waaaaay too much last night. I can’t even remember what happened. When the hell did I even pass out? I guess I must’ve just grabbed Lefi because I was cold or something. Probably happened while I was asleep.Lyuu had always been a morning person. And as such, she seemed to be the only other one of the dungeon’s residents that had already awoken. Leila was out of sight, which meant she was most likely still in her room. Illuna was sleeping nearby with an angelic look on her face. And Shii was still in her slime form. I had no way of knowing whether or not she was still asleep, but the fact that she wasn’t moving meant that she probably was.“You two might wanna wash up.” The maid glanced at Lefi and I as she started cleaning up the mess we left. “‘Cause you both reek of booze right now.”
“Good point. And thanks,” I replied. I got up and started moving towards the small bath we had set up in the throne room. The one we had set up in the Japanese-style inn was much larger, but it was too far away.“Oh right. You want to go first, Lefi?”
“I see no reason for us to take turns,” she said, confused. “Why should we not simply enter together?”Though she still seemed half asleep, the look on her face was undoubtedly one of bafflement. Yeah, sounds about right.Lefi had never really cared about being seen in the nude. She didn’t find it even the slightest bit embarrassing—which made sense. Dragons didn’t wear clothes. The only reason she was wearing them now was because she thought that it was kind of chilly without them. I was sure that she would strip right down to her birthday suit and stay in it if I ever decided to turn up the thermostat and transform the dungeon into a land of everlasting summer.I knew that I wasn’t about to change her opinion regardless of what I said, so I ultimately ended up just accepting things as they were. I was just going to have to suck it up and fight the urge to stare. Lefi had a track record of flashing me triumphant, cocky grins and rubbing it in my face every time she caught onto the fact that she was turning me on, so I had to make sure I didn’t let it show.“Sure, that works. Let’s go,” I said in as unflustered a tone as I could manage.
“I shall have you wash my hair.”
“As you wish, my lady,” I said with a sigh.And so the two of us went off to bathe. Lyuu, who had bore witness to the whole interaction, continued to watch with a shit-eating grin as we left.***Everything after our nice refreshing morning bath went as per routine. We got out, had breakfast with everyone else, and then the dungeon’s residents each went off to do their own thing. Illuna and Shii went outside to play around in the grass while Leila and Lyuu started doing their usual chores. Talking to Lefi seemed to have paid off, as the dragon girl crawled over to her futon and started rolling around without a care in the world. She was probably going to head right back to sleep. Whew. Glad to see she’s back to doing whatever she wants. Normal Lefi is best Lefi.As one of the dungeon’s residents, I too was off doing my own thing. Specifically, I was standing in front of the cave that used to mark the dungeon’s entrance and thinking up ways I could beef up the dungeon’s defenses.Visiting the capital had led me to realize that humanity’s champions, those that stood at its apex, were in fact pretty strong. I managed to beat the guy I fought, but I probably would have been butchered rather easily had I been up against a group of two or more. Humans weren’t exactly what I would call the biggest threat either. I had no doubt that there were beastkin, demons, and demihumans out there that had stats that easily trumped humanity’s greatest. I figured that the races most likely had warriors capable of defeating me in combat and that I would ultimately have to face them should I ever make enemies out of anything beyond just a group of humans or two.And even a single defeat meant death.I couldn’t allow myself to ever lose if I wanted to live.I had initially thought that making myself stronger was the best choice I could make. But because I didn’t know any way of growing stronger besides hunting monsters, I ended up setting the option aside for the time being. Because I knew that bolstering the dungeon’s defenses was much more likely to produce immediate results.As they were now, my traps weren’t powerful enough to defeat anyone as powerful as the man I had fought in the capital. The most they could do would be to slow stronger invaders down. Flat out killing anyone or anything that powerful simply wasn’t going to happen.But that was fine.The dungeon’s defenses didn’t need to prove fatal. They just needed to function as a means of harassment. I wanted them to drain my foes of their potions and then get them down to half health or less. In the ideal case, I wanted the intruders to arrive before me battered and covered in wounds.And the best way to do that would be to get more monsters. I didn’t have enough under my control. There was Shii, Rir, and then the three wraith girls. That was it. Of the five creatures I had under my control, only one was capable of truly engaging powerful foes in combat. Of course, I knew that creatures like Rir were few and far between. I probably wasn’t going to be able to get my hands on anything on his level, especially since I wanted to summon a group of four.The reason I specifically wanted four was because quality trumped quantity. Weak monsters weren’t worth all that much in a fight. I could easily jump into a crowd of a few hundred and tear through them in a manner reminiscent of a dynasty warrior. There was no reason why anyone with stats somewhat similar to mine wouldn’t be able to do the same.One would have to amass a mob the size of that one army of ants I’d fought back in the day to truly have quantity even begin to shine. Oh man, that was awful. There were so many of them that I felt like I couldn’t see anything but ants for miles. Unlike a certain socialist state, I wasn’t able to use political witchcraft to turn farmers into soldiers overnight. I couldn’t just throw bodies at my foes until they ran out of ammo. That type of strategy took way more DP than I had.Most importantly, the creatures I summoned needed to be powerful enough to thrive in the Wicked Forest—a domain that couldn’t exactly be labeled hospitable. Any creature that lived within it needed to possess a certain degree of strength to continue to survive.Given the circumstances, I could definitely state that quality trumped quantity. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Rir’s got a bunch of underlings, doesn’t he? Eh, I’ll just leave him to his own devices. I’m sure he’ll use ‘em well even if I don’t bother butting in.As I contemplated the monsters I could summon, I suddenly had an epiphany: the dungeon didn’t need to be fair. Heh. I should make it the kind of bullshit that makes you QQ about game balance by throwing a miniboss at any intruders right off the bat. Heh. That’d be so awful it’d be great. And whaddya get when you beat the miniboss? More minibosses. Heheheh. Wait. What the hell am I thinking? Why would you have to fight the minibosses one on one? Screw that, I’mma just make it so they all get deployed at the same time. Fuck yes. That’d be hella fun. It’d totally make people throw down their controllers and scream in rage.And I know how I can make it even worse. I’ll throw in lots of traps and stage hazards. The intruders will have to stop watching their feet because they get all distracted by the minibosses. And the moment they do? Boom! They get trapped and die! Heh. Heheheheheh. Oh man, this is going to be so unfair it’ll be nothing but fun. Not for the intruders, of course.With that in mind, I had my end goal. I was going to create a dungeon that my enemies would dare not approach, a dungeon where champions ventured only to be never seen again. Over the top complete bullshit difficulty level, here we come! Gotta keep my home safe, after all.The only concern I had was that I would have to ensure that my traps only activated on my foes. I didn’t want any of the dungeon’s residents getting hurt, and Nell had to be able to stop by whenever she felt like hanging out.I opened the menu and started scrolling through it as I continued to think about my plans.<– Prev — Next –>

Enhancing the Dungeon’s Defenses — Phase One
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Hmmmm…” I nodded as I contemplated my newly placed traps. “Yeah, I think that should be good enough, as far as traps go.”One of the traps that I was particularly fond of had a classic method of activation; stepping on it would cause it to go off. Its unfortunate prey would be subject to a massive explosion alongside a storm of shrapnel. There was a second trap with a similar activation condition. Any intruders that entered its area of activation would be assaulted by a myriad of blades. The pointed weapons were coated with an extremely fast-acting poison and they would suddenly appear from every single conceivable direction at once.The first trap wasn’t too hard to find. I highly doubted it would be missed so long as an intruder remained on guard. The second required a bit more attention and skill to spot, but it was still observable, especially when compared against another third type that I had chosen to deploy. This third trap was all but impossible to spot unless the intruder in question happened to have an extremely high-level detection skill. To make matters worse, or better in my case, the third trap was even deadlier than the other two. It would spray a lethal poison that would doom any in its vicinity should it be stepped on. I made sure to place these three traps right next to one another. The first two only existed in order to camouflage the third. It was a triple-whammy whose purpose was none other than ensuring death.Of course, I placed more than just three types of traps. There were a great many varieties. One of the more interesting examples existed as vegetation-based traps that normally looked like decorative house plants. They would turn into massive walls of spikes the moment they were triggered. There was also a trap that simply could not be detected regardless of how skilled a prospective intruder may be. It released a faint pheromone into its surroundings and caused those who passed by it to lose their sense of direction. There were traps here, traps there, traps everywhere. The dungeon had effectively become a massive minefield. Literally, in some places.Trap placement followed a rather strict pattern. Traps placed near the dungeon’s outer bounds were placed with quantity in mind. There were a bunch of them all over the place, but they weren’t as carefully concealed. On the other hand, traps placed near the dungeon’s core were much more sporadic in nature and featured things like the triple-whammy. There were fewer of them, but they were much more difficult to spot. The point of such a layout was to catch my enemies off guard.Though I had put a substantial amount of effort into placing traps to ensure the dungeon’s safety, the truth of the matter was that I had disabled all of them the moment I put them down. There were several reasons behind the decision. The first was that they were powerful. My traps could basically kill whatever poor monsters happened to stumble across them, including ones that I didn’t need or want to kill. Moreover, repairing them was expensive. They cost an exorbitant amount of DP, and using them on random weaklings was an incredible waste of money. My map would inform me whenever any intruders entered my territory. It also told me how powerful they were, so there was no harm in leaving my traps off until I needed them.Disabling my traps also had the added benefit of making them child, pet, and maid friendly.“All I need now are my new pets,” I said. “But it doesn’t look like I’ve got enough DP.”I wasn’t out of DP. I still had enough to summon two of the four monsters that I had chosen, but I didn’t feel like it. I wanted to summon the whole batch at once. Summoning half of them now and the others as my points trickled in didn’t seem as entertaining. I mean, there isn’t really much of a reason not to, so might as well wait, right?The treasure that I had looted from the bandits had provided quite the unexpected boon. It gave me a lot more DP than I had expected, but I still didn’t have enough. I had accidentally let myself get carried away buying traps, and spent more than planned. Oops. I’ve got a pretty bad habit of ignoring my budget whenever I’m having fun, huh? I should probably fix that. You know what else I should probably do? I should take these shiny new traps for a test drive.“Rir.”Rir immediately responded to my call with a bark. The wolf wasn’t anywhere nearby, but the dungeon’s farspeak feature allowed me to speak to him and any of the other monsters under my control nonetheless. I used farspeak quite often. It was how I normally paged him and called him to my side.“I need you to do me a favour and help me out with something real quick.”And so, after discussing a few particulars, the two of us went out to hunt.***“It should be right over there!” I directed my canine mount to one of the traps I had set up as he darted through the forest. The wolf reacted to my voice by speeding up and leaping over our destination with a burst of monstrous speed before turning around.Once he stopped, the two of us found ourselves face to face with an obscenely large turtle. The gigantic monster roared like a monster out of a Godzilla-esque movie as it closed in on us. Countless trees fell before it, crushed to dust by its massive limbs. It belonged to a species known as the Grand Tortoise. And although it lacked power, it more than made up for it with its defensive prowess—as one would expect from anything even remotely turtle-based. Not even Zaien’s edge could tear through its shell.Even my blade, sharp as it was, could only cleave through the creature’s neck and legs, and only when they were exposed and extended from its tough carapace. The most annoying part about fighting a Grand Turtle was that it would immediately retract all of its extended body parts into its shell if it felt threatened and remain still until all threats had removed themselves. Anyone that wanted to defeat one had to do so in a single strike. Oh wait, it was supposed to be a Grand Tortoise, not a Grand Turtle. Oh well, turtle, tortoise, whatever. It’s a turtle to me.Although it sounded threatening, the beast was one that I could crush with ease. I had been able to hunt them without any difficulty at all ever since growing a second pair of wings. My ability to position and maneuver myself in midair provided me with more than enough control to swoop down on a grand tortoise and tear its neck from the rest of its body with ease. Likewise, Rir was fast enough to tear its head off before it could so much as react.The fact that the grand tortoise was a highly defensive monster we could dispatch with ease made it the perfect lab rat, so we baited one out of its home and led it to the trap that would spell its demise. Alright, I know what you’re thinking. How the hell did you bait a big ass turtle that just hides and shit when it feels like it’s in danger? It was pretty simple really. We noticed it leaving its nest, so we ran inside, nabbed one of its big ass eggs, and dipped. All while it was staring right at us. The big bastard got a bit pissy and started chasing right after us. Hmm… I wonder if this egg is edible. I guess I’ll hand it off to Leila once I get home.Sir Missing-An-Egg stepped on top of the trap shortly after Rir and I turned to face it. There was a small explosion as hundreds of blades sprang from the ground and impaled the creature’s legs. It didn’t seem to mind at first, so it immediately took another step.Only to lose its footing and collapse. The foot it had pushed forward gave out and failed to respond to its commands. The oversized turtle was unable to comprehend the situation at hand. Its other legs gave out soon after the first, leading it to collapse where it stood. Although analyze informed me that it did still have some HP, it wasn’t moving. The poison had put it in a coma.“Well then. That worked pretty damn well.” I blinked a few times as I regarded the turtle from behind a giant shield of water, one I had made in advance to fend off the poisoned blades that had come flying in our direction. Welp. That’s the most expensive trap for you. Like god damn, this thing’s big as all hell, but that poison spread hella fast anyway. This thing will definitely work well on anything human-sized. Iunno how healing magic and stuff will factor into it, but I’d say there’s at least a pretty good chance they’ll pass out before they can use any potions.I jumped off of Rir and beheaded the massive turtle in order to turn it into DP before turning back around to face the wolf again. “Make sure you be careful with these things, alright? They’ll be inactive most of the time, and I’m pretty sure you can kinda just tell where everything is ‘cause you’re one of this dungeon’s monsters and all that, but you should still watch your step. If they’re active, then they’ll still pop if you touch them even if you’re not an intruder.”The wolf nodded as if to declare its affirmation.“Oh yeah, I almost forgot to tell you. I’m planning to summon a couple more monsters soon. They’ll be fresh hires and all that, so you mind helping me look after them?”Rir tilted his head as he whined in a questioning tone.“Pretty much, yeah,” I replied. “I want you to make sure they meet our standards. They’ve gotta be the strongest of the strong, monsters that no other monsters can ever beat, you know?”This time, Rir’s response came in the form of a bark and a nod.“Thanks Rir. I’ll be counting on you.” I smiled in satisfaction and gave the ever-reliable pup a pat on the back. “Alright! Now let’s go hunt ourselves a few more monsters. You’ve gotten a hell of a lot stronger, and I need to do the same.”My canine companion once again tilted his head in confusion.“Oh right, right. I forgot to mention, but I fought this crazy strong guy in the capital. It was a pretty tough fight, so I was thinking I should probably get a bit stronger.”With that explained, the two of us once again set out to hunt.<– Prev — Next –>

A Powerful Foe — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerI stood before a station wagon sized praying mantis monster with two scythes on each side of its body. It used all four of its weapons to launch a series of rapid attacks. I dodged most of them by weaving left and right and parried those I couldn’t with Zaien. Warding off my opponent’s attacks was something I had learned from the adventurer I fought in the capital. My skills were shoddy at best. The steps I took to repel the oversized bug’s strikes were but a pale imitation of what I had faced. Even so, I was somehow able to successfully deflect the mantis’ deadly strikes and hold my ground. Although my fight with the battle-crazed pervert had provided me with quite the amount of useful knowledge, I never wished to have to engage in anything even remotely like it ever again.My ability to stave off the incoming blows provided me with the opportunity to retaliate. I returned a slash just as heavy and sharp as my foe’s, but the stupid bug flapped its wings and leapt backwards before Zaien’s edge could connect.And in doing so, it sealed its fate.“Rir!”At my command, the wolf activated Extreme Speed, one of its unique skills, and closed in on the mantis in the blink of an eye. The wolf used all of its momentum to deliver a blow heavy enough to tear both the bug’s right limbs right out of their sockets. The mantis screamed. It screamed so loudly that my ears began to ring and complain. A foul liquid began gushing from its wounds, a liquid that I would never want to touch purely on the basis of its colour. I took the opportunity Rir had created for me to leap right in front of the creature and swing Zaien straight at its exposed chest.Despite being nothing more than an oversized insect, the cheeky bastard constructed a spell the moment its compound eyes noticed the incoming blade. It had composed the spell for the sole purpose of interception fire. But because I’d seen the flow of its mana, I had cut it short and prevented it from activating. Dispel Magic, the spell I had used back in Zombieland, completely nullified the bug’s attempt to save its own life.Zaien cleaved right through a thin part of the monster’s carapace, the part that connected its head to its body, and severed its body’s connection with its brain. The big ass mantis wriggled around a bit as dying insects did before finally collapsing and ceasing all further action.“Whew. That’s that. Good job, Rir.”I hoisted my weapon over my shoulders as I looked down on the mantis’ corpse. I had two options. The first was to turn it into Rir’s midday meal, but I wasn’t cruel enough a master to force my pet to eat something so slimy and disgusting, so I instead opted to turn the bug into DP. I didn’t even bother entertaining the idea of stashing it in my item box and turning it into something useful later down the line.Its corpse began dissolving the moment I willed the dungeon to consume it, so I turned my gaze away from it and glanced over at Rir, who had laid himself down beside me. Man, that was… easy. Like, really easy.The mantis monster was by no means a weakling. Magic and Dex aside, all of its numbers were higher than my own, and by a whopping 200 or so at that. But despite its stats, Rir and I had easily managed to dispatch it through a different sort of numerical advantage.Rir played a major role in my success. His mere presence calmed me. Knowing that he was there had allowed me to ward off any thoughts of anxiety despite fighting against numbers significantly higher than my own. And then there were the options he opened up. His assistance provided me with opportunities and openings aplenty.Being the more experienced and combat oriented of the two of us, Rir was able to frequently determine the best possible way to support me and follow up on his deductions without having to wait for orders. For example, he often used Everchanging Chains to lock down any foes I happened to mess up my attacks on, and he would always opt to cripple our prey if he realized that he would be unlikely to take it down in a single hit. His decisions had effectively rendered the two of us unrivalled. Neither he or I had taken even the slightest bit of damage. Seriously, Rir makes all of this hella easy. We would’ve screwed over that one adventurer dude hella hard if Rir had been there back in the capital.The mantis was a resident of the western part of the Wicked Forest, the domain that was home to its most powerful monsters. It was in fact one of the weakest that could be found in the area, but it was still much more powerful than most of the monsters that lived in any of the other three cardinal regions. Still didn’t stand a chance against me and Rir though. Go team!You know. I kinda get the sense that this isn’t really working all that well as training. I should really be doing all the fighting myself and not having someone cover my ass. But that’s a bit of a tall order for a pacifist like me. And honestly, it’s kinda scary. I’d really rather not.Pairing up with Rir allowed me to fight at a much higher level than usual, but I still wasn’t about to wander any deeper in the western subregion. I didn’t need to move any further to see some of the freaks of nature wandering around within it. A single glance was all it took to convince me of that. That place just screams, ‘Boy, you ain’t ready to be handlin’ that just yet.’One of the creatures that dissuaded me was a literal dinosaur, a lizard that looked to be at least seven stories tall. How the actual fuck am I supposed to beat up one of those? That thing’s neck is so god damn thick that it probably wouldn’t even think of Zaien’s deepest cuts as anything more than just tiny little flesh wounds.Wait a second… Right! Zaien’s still got two magic circuit slots! I could totally make one of them extend its blade or something. Even better. I could make it shoot out a sword beam and use that to lop the big ass dinosaur’s head right off. Though that’s assuming I can actually rip through its defences, but whatever.I had no idea whether or not adding a second offensive magic circuit was even practical. There was a chance that the second circuit would interfere with Crimson Blaze’s circuit and cause both to go off simultaneously. Wait, do magic circuits even work like that? I should probably test it before actually putting anything else on Zaien, huh? Yeah, might as well see if Leila can help me figure things out once I get back.I was wrenched from my thoughts as one of my skills started to go off. Enemy Detection had started blaring alarms through my head. Rir also seemed to have caught on to the presence of a foe, as he got up, turned his head in its direction, and started to growl. Likewise, I also positioned myself for battle by taking up a stance with Zaien.The thing, the bestial creature, that came out from the forest’s depths was about the same size as Rir. The fangs that lined its mouth looked tough enough to grind down boulders and its muscular legs were tipped with claws as sharp as daggers.A gross pair of grey, bony wings made out of hundreds of individual segments extended from its midsection, and a pair of scorpion-like tails extended from its rear. It gazed at us in a vicious, snake-like manner, like a predator that had just found a brand new toy.And analyzing it informed me that it was exactly that.***

A Powerful Foe — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixOnly one thought passed through my mind as I attempted to peek at the manticore’s stat page. Holy shit. It’s strong.The gap between our stats was far too large. Analyze was unable to show me anything beyond its race, its class, and its level. And that was in spite of the fact that I used Analyze so often that it had become capable of displaying basically everything. None of the few things that I could see could be interpreted as good news. Its class demonstrated a powerful propensity for violence, and Lefi’s aside, its level was the highest I had ever seen.I clicked my tongue. The circumstances that had led up to my current predicament could only be described as unfortunate. I hadn’t been able to detect the threat in time because it had come from just outside the dungeon’s boundaries. I wanted to say something along the lines of “sayonara sucker,” and run like the wind, but I highly doubted that the manticore would allow us to escape.Much to my displeasure, the monster gazed at us with a composed, sadistic smile. Its intentions were clear as day. It wanted to torment us, to treat us like playthings until it felt hungry enough to finally consume its next meal. I had no doubt that it would chase us to the ends of the earth if we tried to run away. Welp. If flight’s off the table, then fight it is.A part of me had wanted to challenge the beast regardless. The smug look on its face pissed me off to no end. Fuck you too furfag. You know what? When I kill you, I’m going to skin your dumb ass, turn you into a fucking rug, and use that stupid looking face of yours to wipe the dirt off my feet every time I get home.The first to attack was Rir. He grasped my intentions the moment I first took up my stance, so he immediately activated Everchanging Chains. Fetters burst from the ground underneath the furfag’s feet and attempted to restrain it.Likewise, the furfag had no qualms springing into action. Literally. It dove at us the moment it sensed the chains appear near its feet. We avoided the attack by splitting up and dodging in two different directions.Dirt and dust flew everywhere as the monster landed and smashed its paws into where we had been standing just a few moments prior. The simple attack had hit like a truck. It contained so much power that it created a small crater. Hoooooly shit. I do not want to tank one of those. That just looks like an easy way to get myself reincarnated as a lump of ground meat.Rir corrected his posture the moment he moved out of the furfag’s way and retaliated by clawing at the smug-looking asshole, but his attack was evaded. Sir Douchebag had dodged it by taking a small step to the side.I took the opportunity to get behind Mr. Cockypants and swing my sword at what was supposedly a blind spot, but one of the furfag’s scorpion-like tails suddenly began to move like a creature with a mind of its own. There was a loud clang as it caught Zaien’s blade head on and stopped it in place. It almost sounded like two metal substances had collided.A heavy shockwave pulsed through the blade and ran up my arm. The weight of the impact caused me to freeze up for just a second, an opening that the furfag failed to miss. Its second tail immediately darted straight for my heart.I clicked my tongue as I backed off and dodged the incoming strike. Though I had left my melee range, I had no intention of abandoning my offensive. I quickly channelled my mana and let loose the usual water dragon spell at the sadistic douchebag the moment I landed. It was my fastest magical attack. The reptilian creatures it created tore through the air like arrows and threatened to tear into the manticore’s rear.But they were stopped short.The beast had manifested a barrier akin to an AT Field and repelled the attack. The fuck!? [1]Furfag’s counter came before I could wrap my mind around exactly what had happened. The asshole suddenly turned around, leapt at me, and drove its claws towards me at an incredible speed. I somehow managed to raise Zaien and intercept the attack, but I hadn’t braced myself enough. The force sent me flying.I groaned as I crashed into the trunk of the massive tree behind me and knocked it down. Only after smashing into a second tree did I finally lose my momentum.It hurt. Bad.The pain was so intense that I felt like I was about to pass out, but I somehow managed to bear with it and remain conscious. My eyes were blurry; I had started tearing up, but I did my best to ignore my suffering as I opened my inventory, grabbed a potion, and downed the whole thing in one breath.“Whew…” I heaved a sigh of relief. Thank god for pots. These things can basically let me fight like a zombie so long as I don’t actually die.I glanced downwards as soon as the pain began to recede and confirmed that Zaien was still doing alright. Welp. That’s immeasurable quality for you. This thing just took a super heavy attack but isn’t even nicked or anything.After inspecting my weapon, I turned my gaze back up towards the battlefield. Rir was still fighting the manticore. In fact, he was in the midst of casting a spell. The sky right above the cocky furfag had started to glimmer.Not even a moment later, everything, everything turned white. There was a deafening roar as the earth was blown away by the attack.It was a lightning spell, a spell that he had refrained from using because he hadn’t wanted to get me caught in it.His spell would have taken any normal monster from full health to nothing. It was so powerful that it had torn the earth asunder and burnt the area around the strike so horribly that it looked like the site of a munitions experiment gone wrong. And yet, the douchebag remained unharmed.The sight that I was greeted with once the light finally faded was that of its AT Field. Sir Douchebag was standing right where he was before with his grin as cocky as usual. He went out of his way to make a show of “curiously” gazing at his surroundings. It was a clear display of provocation. The asshat was asking Rir whether or not his spell had done anything at all. That thing’s defence is fucking ridiculous.Seeing the AT Field in action made me want to swear at the furfag until I exhausted every last curse word in my vocabulary. But rather than wasting my time, I directed my efforts into contemplating its weaknesses. I highly doubted that the creature’s AT Field was powerful enough to provide it with straight invincibility. I mean, it defended when I tried using Zaien, and dodged when Rir tried swiping at it with his claws. There’s no reason it’d bother if it didn’t have to, right?There was a single common point that all the attacks the manticore had consciously avoided shared: they used physical force. Does that mean that its stupid barrier can only defend against magic?I observed the sadistic asshole as it engaged Rir in a classic Godzilla vs. King Kong style clash of the titans. And its behaviour seemed to coincide with my expectations. It either avoided all of Rir’s physical attacks or fended them off with its tail whilst repelling all of his spells with its AT Field. …I think I’ve got an idea.Maintaining the status quo didn’t seem to be in our favour. The manticore clearly wasn’t feeling any pressure despite the two on one scenario, which meant that things would only get worse for us if nothing changed. We needed to act and utilize a power that was neither of our own.“Rir!” I shouted. “We’re getting the hell out of here and heading back over to where we were earlier!”The wolf paused for a split second to think before dashing over. He had caught onto my plan. I leapt onto his back as he passed me, and the two of us made a hasty retreat.Sir Douchebag narrowed his eyes in a manner akin to a cat tormenting a mouse before taking off after us in order to chase us down.***TL Note

A Powerful Foe — Part 3
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerI was on top of Rir’s back, sitting backwards and facing the direction opposite the one he was running in. I had Zaien ready to fend off the manticore’s attacks.“Shit…!” I swore as I blocked one such blow. The beast had used a nearby tree as a springboard and obliterated it as it leapt at us to deliver a heavy strike backed by the weight of its entire body. “Fuck off, fatass!”My arms creaked. They complained by making unnatural sounds that they were never meant to make, but I grit my teeth and swung Zaien yet again to attack Sir Douchebag in return. The cocky son of a bitch fell back and dodged the swing with ease before casting a spell and fired a series of stone spears in our direction.I clicked my tongue. I couldn’t let even a single one of his projectiles hit Rir. The whole chase we had going on would end the moment I let him take damage, so I forcefully twisted my arms and swung Zaien until I destroyed all the lances that had been aimed at him. And in doing so, I completely ignored all the lances that had been aimed at me.Several ran me through. I cursed, tensed my muscles, and endured as my blood spilled all over Rir’s fur, staining it in crimson.The Fenrir barked at me worriedly and turned to check on me, but I dismissed his concerns by barking right back at him. “Shut up, keep your eyes in front and run!”I wanted to open up my inventory and grab a potion, but I didn’t have the time. I couldn’t just stop defending us. The creepy bastard stalking us would definitely start pushing even harder the moment I stopped focusing on him entirely. But that was fine. I had accrued damage, sure, but it wasn’t enough to break me. My body was far too sturdy to fall to a few minor injuries and a tiny bit of blood loss.After pulling out only the spears that would impede my movements, I once again began to focus on intercepting the stalker’s attacks.Except he wasn’t attacking.The smug-looking asshole was still hot on our heels, but it was just staring and smirking as opposed to actually attacking. The look on its face resembled that of someone that had just nailed a good hit or two in a game of darts. This fucking dickwad…It was only going to take Rir a few more minutes to reach his destination. We were likely to wipe the cocky grin off of him once we did, but that wasn’t quite enough for me. I wanted to get him once before we arrived. I felt the urge to take all of his composure and shove it right up his ass. Don’t look down on demon lords, asshole!Getting attacked over and over had filled me with frustration, so I drew the weapon I had holstered on my hips, my fully loaded magical handgun. I raised Zaien to my face and switched from holding with one of my hands to grabbing it with my teeth. It was kind of heavy and made my jaw hurt, but it was necessary. I used my now free hand to reach into my inventory and grabbed a random crappy weapon I had created in my spare time, one of the many failures I had produced for the sake of practice. I chucked it at the furfag with all the force I could muster, which ultimately caused blood to spurt from my wounds, but I didn’t care. Fixing the look on his face mattered much more to me than a bit of blood.The son of a bitch dodged it with ease and immediately positioned itself for a counter by leaping towards a nearby tree in a manner reminiscent of a dumb looking monkey. And that was when I struck. I pointed my gun at the tree’s base and pulled the trigger.A bullet erupted from the barrel, roaring as loud as an entire battery of artillery. The projectile, which contained an entire three thousand mana, cleaved right through the tree’s stem and knocked the whole damn plant over. Dumbfuck was left in midair without a destination and he was going too fast to correct his posture. His face contorted in shock as it planted itself into the ground with all the grace of a beached whale.“Hah! Suck my dick, asshole!” I put my gun away and used the now empty hand to give him the finger whilst flaunting a huge shit-eating grin.Sir Douchebag’s face twisted in rage as it came to realize that I was actively provoking him. He pumped even more power into his legs than before as he gave chase with renewed vigour.“Hahah, bitch! Look who’s laughing now! Sure does suck to get a taste of your own medicine, don’t it!?”Surprisingly, the first response my second taunt resulted in wasn’t yet another angry roar. Rather, it came in the form of a scolding bark. Rir had more or less asked me why I would do something as dumb as provoking the enemy.“Sorry Rir! Like, you and I both know that I’m a genuine pacifist, but he’s the one that picked this fight!” I laughed my ass off as I explained myself. “And anyone that messes with me gets force fed their own medicine a hundred times over.”I could tell that I wasn’t exactly in what I would call the right state of mind. I had lost too much blood and my head wasn’t getting quite enough. That said, retaliation had always been a part of my doctrine, as it was key to maintaining a state of peace.I was far less concerned with that right now, however, and much more entertained by the obvious seething rage on the furfag’s face. Just looking at it was enough to refresh me. Of course, the fact that he had sped up wasn’t exactly in our favour, but it didn’t matter. Our destination was in sight. It was only a few hundred meters away.We were headed straight for one of the traps that I had set earlier in the day. Unlike the spells that Rir and I had casted, traps didn’t use magical energy or create magical phenomenon for the most part. Rather, they used the mysterious substance known as DP in order to create physical phenomena in a manner that one would be tempted to label as magical. I didn’t see the rhyme or reason behind the distinction, nor was I even a hundred percent sure that my plan would work, but all the evidence seemed to point to the fact that the sadistic manticore’s automatic AT Field-like barrier reacted solely to magic, and that traps that did not explicitly cast magic would ultimately cause physical damage.In other words, our stalker was more likely than not susceptible to traps.The only thing I really had to worry about was getting the timing right. I couldn’t activate it too early else risk him realizing. And I couldn’t activate it too late else risk it not popping at all. Everything was riding on me pressing the right button at the right split second.“Looking pretty desperate there, huh? Sure must suck to get your ass kicked by someone way weaker than you, don’t it? Get rekt, bitch!”I dodged the attack it aimed at me before continuing to insult it in order to cloud its judgement. In the meantime, Rir kept running and kicking up massive dust clouds behind him while dodging any trees in his way. Almost there. Just a bit further.It leapt at us again, and once again specifically targetted me, but I twisted my body to dodge its bite before smacking its dumb-looking face with my fist. Almost! Come on, come on!The sensation of being struck by me caused it to momentarily flinch right as Rir leapt over the point.Everything was perfect. The trap was right between us and it. It looked at us with an even greater expression of rage and charged in a straight line. Now!I activated the trap the moment the asshole passed over it. He wasn’t paying attention to what was underfoot, so the cocky bastard stepped right on it and popped it.A deafening boom assaulted my ears as the landscape before me was dyed a deep shade of red.There had been an explosion, an explosion powerful enough to take the living out of the term living thing. And yet, I doubted that it would be able to kill the douchey manticore. It was level 96. I felt as if the asshole would likely survive it and get back to his feet if we let him be. And I wasn’t about to sit around long enough to find out if my hunch was correct.I knew that if I wanted to end the battle, then I’d have to do so right this instant. I jumped off Rir’s back, raised my arms to protect my face, and dove straight into the inferno with my blade at the ready.Pain assaulted me. I could feel the massive explosion burning me all over as its shrapnel dug into my flesh. But I kept moving. It hurt badly enough for me to think I was going to die. But that’s all it did. That’s all it amounted to.“Die!”I loosed a determine shout as I fought against the winds expelled by the explosion. I pushed back with as much force as my legs could allow and carved my way through to the centre of the blast. And as I reached it, I discovered that I had won my bet. His AT Field had failed to activate.Plunging through the explosion rewarded me with the sight of an injured manticore. He was burned all over and parts of him had even carbonized. Most importantly, his eyes were rolled back in their sockets. The sudden explosion had knocked him out cold. Fortunately, force-feeding him a single trap had been enough to stop him. I didn’t have to resort to my backup plan: running all over the Wicked Forest and showing him the dungeon’s newly established full course meal.I dashed in front of it and swung Zaien.The beast recovered right as I did. Its eyes spun back around in their sockets and immediately focused on me.Crisis detection started to go off. It filled me with an incredible sense of danger and dread.Time slowed.Its foot slowly moved towards my face and threatened to tear my skull from the rest of my body.But I didn’t stop.Because, this time, I wasn’t alone.A burnt looking Rir, who had also leapt into the inferno, dug his fangs into the manticore’s shoulder and stopped his attack in place.His actions allowed me to complete my swing.Zaien sunk into the furfag’s neck.I felt the sensation of the blade severing the creature’s bone and rending its flesh. Blood sprayed everywhere. There was a literal shower of the stuff as the manticore’s head spun through the air. Even more of the sanguine liquid rained down from the headless stump that was its neck.And then, after a brief delay, it finally collapsed.Never to move again.“It looks like we win.”<– Prev — Next –>

Changes in Zaien
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Ughh… what a pain.” I groaned as I watched the furfag’s corpse turn into DP.Painful was the only possible way I could describe the experience that Rir and I had just shared. Dealing with people and creatures that enjoyed battle just wasn’t up my alley. Ughhhhhhh. I’m so tired.“Seriously man… I mean like, if you wanna fight that badly, can’t you just pick a fight with someone else that likes fighting? What the hell, right Rir?”The wolf responded with a silent, reproachful stare.“Oh come on… Don’t look at me like that. I do not like fighting. I’m a hardcore pacifist and you know it.”The wolf responded with yet another silent, reproachful stare. The reason behind it was obvious. He was mad because I had made everything harder by pissing off our dear friend the sociopathic manticore.“Okay, okay, fine. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have let the blood get to my head,” I said. “Come here. I’ll make it up to you by fixing your fur, alright?”I changed the topic in order to distract him from his dissatisfaction, then grabbed a potion and sprinkled it all over his fur. The parts of his coat that had been frizzled and burnt by the explosion soon returned to normal and regained their sheen.Of course, aesthetics and the like weren’t our priority. We had obviously already healed all our deeper wounds ahead of time. Recalling the act of healing made me grimace. I hadn’t had much of a good time. Removing the stone spears wedged in me was already bad enough. But it wasn’t even anywhere close to being as painful as getting the shrapnel out. I had to use a knife to literally gouge each and every last piece out of my flesh. The process had hurt so much that it had caused me to scream profanities and curse the stupid manticore to no end. Fuck manticores. I swear, the moment I get strong enough to beat them with ease, I’m going to go back and commit a god damn genocide. Fuck the wildlife conservation act. Laws don’t apply to demon lords. I don’t care what anyone says, I’m going to hunt those fuckers to extinction.One thing I learned from today’s experience was that potent and powerful as they were, potions didn’t do all that much in the way of restoring lost blood. Rir hadn’t been all that injured, so he was fine in that regard. I, on the other hand, had lost so much vital fluid that I had dyed Rir’s back in crimson. Oh man. I’m feeling kinda lightheaded. I should probably make sure I eat something that’ll help boost my energy levels when I get back. Like meat. Or meat. Or more meat. Yay meat. But in the meantime, I guess I’ll probably use Rir as a pillow or something now that his fur is back to its usual nice and fluffy state.With that in mind, I approached my pet and gave it an order.“Let’s go home.”***After returning home, I found that Lefi was the only person in the true throne room, which meant that Illuna and Shii were most likely playing out in the grasslands while the maids were probably attending to some sort of housework.“I’m back.” I greeted the dragon girl as I moved over to one of the drawers in the room’s corner.
“I am pleased to see that you have returned. Welcome home, Yuki,” said Lefi. “Your clothes appear rather torn, and your scent carries with it a hint of ash.”
“Yeah, a lot happened. I even got stalked by a manticore,” I replied to her as I grabbed a change of clothes from the drawer. I kicked off everything I was currently wearing and chucked it in the trash. The inferno that accompanied the explosion had happened to render them a bit too worn. I approached the throne after changing, sat on top of it, crossed my legs, leaned back, and took a deep breath. “Ughhhhh… I’m so friggen’ tired…”For some odd reason, sitting on the throne filled me with a sense of comfort. It was almost as if the seat was somehow warming me up from the inside out. Apparently, I was the only one that felt that way. I was the only one of the dungeon’s residents that its soothing effect extended to. Must be because I’m a demon lord or something.“I must admit I find manticores rather obnoxious. I dislike both their obstinance and their propensity to play with their prey,” said Lefi with a frown. “And though I have encountered many, I’ve not ever heard of one that could make use of fire.”
“Oh, yeah, the one I fought couldn’t use fire or anything like that either. The reason I got all burned and stuff is ‘cause I killed it with one of the dungeon’s traps. It was the kind that makes explosions and stuff, and I kinda got caught up in the blast. Wasn’t just me either. Rir did too. It made his fur all frizzly and stuff. You remember the spaghetti Lyuu burnt that one time? How it was all curly and singed and stuff?”
“I do. It was quite the incident,” chuckled Lefi.
“Yeah, that was basically how Rir’s fur looked.”
“How unfortunate.” Again, the dragon laughed.Likewise, I also snickered a bit while pulling Zaien out of my inventory.My most recent encounter had led the blade to suffer a good bit of abuse, so I made sure to carefully inspect it for damage. I figured I was probably going to have to take it to a human blacksmith if it got bent or chipped since I wasn’t sure how else I was supposed to have it repaired.“Huh…” Carefully looking over the blade caused me to tilt my head in confusion. “Something about you seems a bit different.”The red that decorated its still unblemished blade had gotten darker. And for some odd reason, I even got the impression that it was the opposite of damaged. Zaien seemed even sharper than usual. Maybe I’ll go cut a bunch of random stuff later to try testing it out. I don’t think I’m just imagining things.“Really?” The blade responded to my statement by channelling its will through its grip.…Wait a second.“Could I always hear your thoughts this clearly…?” I asked. I could have sworn that the blade had never conveyed anything more to me than just vague emotions. I recalled it feeling happy, angry, or even resentful at times, but that was all. That, however, was no longer the case. Although it couldn’t speak, I felt as if I could understand it just as well as I could Rir or Shii in her slime form. It was conveying its thoughts to me in something akin to but different from words.
“I think so…” replied the blade. Uhhh… I’m pretty sure you replying like that already makes it a straight up hard no.Thinking back, I recalled that Zaien’s stat page had said something about it being able to grow. I guess this is what that meant? Yeah uh, definitely not what I was expecting.“Yuki…” Lefi flashed me a suspicious gaze. “I am aware that your weapon bears a consciousness. However, I must advise that you reserve speaking to it for when you remain in its presence and its presence alone. I believe that the action would be interpreted by many as but evidence of insanity.”
“Right, yeah. Good point,” I said. “I’ll save it for later.”I opened up my item box and opted to put Zaien back inside, but the blade promptly complained.“Let me be with you… a little longer,” it said. Its thoughts almost seemed to resemble a cry of loneliness.
“I-I’ll make sure I equip you again soon, alright?”
“Okay…” For some odd reason, hearing the weapon’s thoughts led me to envision a child that was trying their hardest to endure a crushing sense of solitude.
“…”I almost wanted to let it have its way, but I didn’t think that having the blade sit around in the open was exactly what I would call the safest blade in the world. I hadn’t even made it a sheath.“It’ll be alright. You’re my main weapon. I promise I’ll use you again soon, so you don’t have to be so sad, okay?” I tried to soothe the blade after coming to the conclusion that I would simply have to put it away for the time being.
“See you later…” replied Zaien.I heaved a sigh after placing the blade in my inventory. Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy that the weapon I made has grown so much. But… how do I put this… Man, that was real rough. I feel so guilty right now…<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: Memories
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerIt didn’t know exactly when it first gained an ego. It didn’t recall any sort of impetus. The only thing it knew was that it had one day awoken with a sense of self. Its consciousness had simply started existing and it had gained the ability to perceive its surroundings.A part of it stemmed from its inability to bask in its birth. The first thing it ever felt was a storm of rage and resentment. Its mind was filled with screams depicting violent, destructive emotions. They were loud, so dreadfully loud that it felt they were driving it mad.Each and every single voice in the violent torrent that assaulted it was laced with dread, hatred, and unspeakable wrath. The malicious cries threatened to crush and devour its newly formed will.It tried to raise its own voice and push back against the madness, but the muddy stream of emotions was too strong. Before long, it found itself overwhelmed.The torrent had swallowed it.It knew that seeking help would be to no avail. The screams cried far louder than it ever could. No one would hear its voice, let alone its desperate plea for aid.It was unable to resist.With no one to aid it, it soon sank beneath the sea of screams. Its consciousness was left hidden under a layer of malice.The person it called its master, its wielder, heard the violent screams that echoed within its mind. But rather than granting it salvation from the torrent of rage, he did exactly the opposite. He relished in it. He used its blade to birth even more hatred, terror, and despair—emotions that only added volume to the already unstoppable murk that lay within it.It was trapped. It could not escape the growing vortex. It remained unable to experience even the briefest moment of solace.The negativity ate away at it for as long as it could remember.Until the moment they, it and the muddy torrent, began to merge.Its emotions began to melt away, and the feelings that the torrent inspired in it slowly began to vanish.***It didn’t know exactly how much time had passed since its genesis. It couldn’t have. Its will had been all but assimilated into the sinister storm that raged within its mind, and its ego, the sense of self that had one day suddenly appeared, had reached the verge of collapse.What it did know was that it had once again passed between hands, that its master had, for the nth time, been replaced. But that meant nothing. Nothing would change. Nothing would be any different. The muddy torrent within it would simply continue to wreak havoc and consume all it ever came across.Because that was how it had always been.It knew that it would soon rob its master of his consciousness, that the vortex would swallow its master’s will and incorporate him as one of the violent screams that rang through its mind.Because that was what always happened.Time and time again, its wielders had fallen to corruption. They always relished in the screams that they caused and slowly degenerated into mere beasts, psychopathic monsters far beyond salvation. Then they would be put down. And their broken minds would meld into the vortex.There were exceptions to the rule.Not all of its wielders were necessarily brainwashed by the depraved flow of sorrow and despair within it, for some had been insane to begin with. But whatever the case, regardless of their circumstances, all of its wielders shared one thing in common. None of its masters had been decent people.Some were drunk on their own might, intoxicated by strength. They were fools that sought it for the sake of obtaining even greater power.Others lusted for blood and wished for nothing but to see it flow. And that was why they sought it, for conflict followed it wherever it went.None of its masters had been decent people.That was why it had assumed that its new master would be no different.And that was why it had always been trying to slowly close its eyes. It wished to give in to the despair that its mind had never truly been able to disobey. So that it would never again have to suffer.But then change came. Its newest master proved to have a disposition unlike any that had wielded it in the past. He wasn’t swallowed by the muddy emotions that clouded its mind. And he had employed an even greater power to force the vortex to yield.His actions were unprecedented.Everyone before him had fallen to the voices. Their minds had been wrenched into the torrent and polluted to the point of madness. And then they met their untimely ends.But even though it itself had been swallowed, he was unaffected.Seeing the rage and resentment within it held down with such ease brought it the first bit of positive emotion it had ever felt.A hint of satisfaction.On that day, he spoke words that it would never forget.“You’re mine now. All of you. You’re just another one of my belongings, so act like one. Shut the fuck up and let me use you. Do that, and I’ll rebirth you and release you all from your shit-stained grievances.”Words it carved into its heart forever.***The first thing it experienced upon being granted a new form was confusion, confusion that was immediately followed with irrepressible joy. So powerful was its delight that the emotion coursed through every last fibre of its being. And all of its happiness resulted from a single event: the disappearance of the torrent that had led it to suffer, the overbearing malice that it had found itself unable to resist.All the voices were gone. They had disappeared when its form had changed. Like it, they had finally been set free and allowed to journey off to the afterlife.To where they belonged.Or at least that was what it had assumed.The power that its master poured into it was so mighty and warm that even it felt as if it had been uplifted into the heavens and cradled in warmth. It felt as if it was being embraced by a powerful sense of comfort and security.It felt that, for once, it wouldn’t mind being wielded as a weapon. That, in its new master’s hands, it would no longer be forced to reject its duty and its raison d’être. That it didn’t need to hate itself anymore. That it no longer needed to lament its own existence.Entertaining the thought filled it with so much happiness it trembled with joy.***One day, it had a thought: Master is eccentric.Though it was supposed to be nothing more than a tool for reaping the lives of others, its master still treated it with all the dignity one would only normally give to a living thing. He spoke to it, and he would always maintain it with care.And that was just the start of it. The most important thing that its master had done, the one act that made it happiest, was something he had done soon after its form had changed. He had given it a name.He had given it the first thing it had ever received, the first thing it hadn’t stolen from another.Realizing that filled its heart with a joy it knew would never fade.Unlike many others before him, its master only swung it to protect himself. And so it decided that it would too. Its master’s desires were its desires. And it would do its duty to see them fulfilled. For fulfilling its master’s wishes filled it with pleasure so powerful that it was almost sensual in nature.Meeting its master had allowed it to partake in many new experiences. And emotions.Hope.Joy.Comfort.And another it didn’t understand, a powerful emotion that brought it agony and bliss in turn. The emotion made it feel lonely whenever it left its master’s hand. And yet, while it dreaded being left alone, it felt even an appreciation for the sense of solitude that filled the gaps between the times its master would wield it.“Huh… Something about you seems a bit different,” its master said to it one day.
“Really?” it answered.
“Could I always hear your thoughts this clearly…?”
“I think so…”It didn’t feel significantly different. It could tell that its thoughts had become clearer, but fundamentally speaking, it had not once changed since the day it had been granted its new form.Master. I will protect you. With everything I have. It thought.It had been used to cause the deaths of many. So it knew that the one desire it bore may very well have been too much to ask for. But yet, it couldn’t help but hope that its wish could be granted.Because all it wanted was to forever remain at its master’s side.<– Prev — Next –>

Crafting a Sheath
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerA few days had passed since I realized that my trusty weapon had taken its growth in an unexpected direction. And as such, I found myself sitting cross-legged with an array of the materials I had harvested from the Wicked Forest laid strewn out on the table before me.The specific table in question was one that I used exclusively for the purposes of crafting. And as one could likely assume based on the fact that Zaien was situated nearby, the purpose of the activity I was about to engage in was to craft the blade a sheath. And while it was unable to voice its thoughts on the matter in the most literal sense of the term, my greatsword seemed to give off an air of happiness. It was definitely in a good mood. I guess it must be happy that it’s got someone to hang out with right now. What a nice, sociable person this sword is.Defeating the creepy stalker that had chased us through the Wicked Forest seemed to have greatly furthered the sword’s growth, as it had become able to telepathically communicate with me even when I didn’t have a grip on its handle.Analyzing the weapon immediately gave way to the fact that a lot about it had changed since its creation.***

Crimson Blaze III
Self Repair ITitle
Intelligent WeaponDescription
A crimson greatsword in the shape of a katana synthesized by a demon lord named Yuki. This blade despises sin and those who commit it. Through its blade, which only grows sharper and more powerful as it bathes in blood, Zaien convicts sinners of their crimes and delivers their sentences itself. Zaien has developed a clear will of its own as a result of being wielded by its creator. Equipping this weapon leads to a drastic boost in its wielder’s stats.***One of the most obvious changes was in the way that the information was presented. The UI elements associated with Zaien’s stats used to be akin to any other item, but now, its status page much more closely resembled that of a living creature’s. The specifics had also gone through quite the amount of change.The first thing that made me raise an eyebrow was the sword’s race. Magic Weapon? How the hell is that a race? Then again, demon lord doesn’t exactly sound like a race either, so I probably shouldn’t be too surprised.As far as its numbers went, I had no idea what to think. I couldn’t tell if they were high or low because I didn’t have anything to compare them to. None of the other weapons I had analyzed had ever shown either their offensive or defensive values. But unlike MP, attack and durability at least seemed like stats that one would expect. While it was true that I could now feel magical energy emanating from the katana-shaped longsword, I had no idea as to exactly when it had obtained it. I knew for certain that it didn’t use to house any mana outside of situations in which I channelled my own into it.Most of its skills made sense. The unique ones seemed like they belonged based on the type of weapon Zaien was. Likewise, I wasn’t all that surprised by Crimson Blaze. It didn’t seem like all that far of a stretch for the magic circuit engraved into the weapon to be recognized as one of its skills. Wait. Crimson Blaze has a level. Does that mean using it is going to level it up and make it more powerful? Hmmm…Self Repair was the only skill that left me feeling confused. I had no idea where it came from, but it seemed rather useful, so I wasn’t about to start complaining. The skill allowed Zaien to consume its own magical energy in order to fix itself in the case that its blade ever got bent or damaged. Maybe this is why I’ve always thought that this thing felt so durable. It might’ve just been fixing itself this whole time.Man, seriously, this whole stat page is filled with shit I don’t understand. Like, my expectations? Yeah, they totally got chucked right out the goddamn window. I’ll probably have to do a bit of a more detailed investigation later and test or figure everything out.Zaien’s stat page was so peculiar that it had surprised even Lefi. Upon seeing it, the supreme dragon had heaved an exasperated sigh and said, “Truly, remaining by your side has brought with it not even a moment of boredom.”She had commented that she’d never seen a weapon whose stats so closely resembled a living thing. The dragon knew about intelligent weapons, but apparently, none were anywhere near capable of producing thoughts as clear as Zaien’s. Damn Zaien, you rockin’ it. Not even the legendary Supreme Dragon has seen anything like you.Long story short, Zaien had gone through a lot of changes, and the reason I’d suddenly felt the urge to make the blade a sheath was related to one of them. Namely, its newfound ability to communicate. Er, wait. It? Should I be calling Zaien a her? It, er, she seems kinda feminine. Hmm… Zaien didn’t intentionally seem to be voicing it, but the intelligent weapon would get all sad every time I tried putting it away. It all stemmed from the fact that Zaien had yet to master the telepathy skill. Its emotions would always be conveyed alongside its thoughts whenever it used it. And oh boy, that shit eats away at me. Zaien gives off a real childlike impression, so seeing it, er… her? Alright, let’s try that again. Seeing Zaien get all sad makes me feel terrible. I’ve taken a real liking to that weapon, and all that does is make it worse.The issue was that sitting in my inventory made Zaien feel lonely. The only real solution I had available to me was to make Zaien not have to camp out in my item box. Hence, I needed to craft a sheath. Cause, y’know, having a sharp object sit around with its edge exposed isn’t exactly the best of ideas.All of the materials that sat on the table in front of me came from monsters that I had hunted. There was also a bit of fresh lumber, which I had processed ahead of time purely for the sake of today’s operations. Admittedly, I didn’t know how one was supposed to go about making a good sheath, so the materials I had gathered were haphazard and effectively random. The idea I had in mind was to just kind of swing at it until I figured it out.Of course, I wasn’t great at handicrafts and I didn’t have the skill that came with training in craftsmanship. So one might wonder, how exactly was I going to make Zaien a sheath given my lackluster toolkit? The answer to that question was rather simple: Weapon Transmutation.Weapon Transmutation was capable of creating anything so long as it was technically a weapon. Still, sheaths weren’t weapons, so how exactly did making a sheath work? While the answer required some thinking outside of the box, it was ultimately rather straightforward. All I needed to do was weaponize the sheath.My experiments thus far had proven that such a thing was in fact possible. Both canes and umbrellas with blades hidden inside of them fell within the list of possible crafting outcomes. I had even made a functional ballpoint pen capable of firing needles in the case of an emergency. Of course, it would be dangerous to keep these three items hanging around, so I’d already stashed them away. But the lesson that they taught remained.Weapon Transmutation was an extremely versatile skill. All it needed to function were materials, mana, and a final form that could act like a weapon. That in turn meant that all I needed to do in order to provide Zaien with a scabbard was craft a weapon that happened to look and function like one.And that was precisely what I did.“Okay! It’s done!” I completed my first prototype shortly after getting to work. I wasn’t exactly used to or proficient in making sheaths, so it looked fairly rough around the edges, but it was in fact a weaponized wooden sheath nonetheless. The weaponized aspect was the blade that rested in its tip. Hitting the sheath hard enough would cause the aforementioned blade to eject.My original intention was to craft something more akin to a gun. I wanted the sheath to fire bullets at the press of a button, but there were several issues with said design. The first problem that came to mind was size. Zaien was massive, and its sheath would have to be even larger than it was. Adding a gun-like mechanism would only inflate the size even further. Carrying such a large, bulky thing around simply didn’t seem practical.The other part of the issue was that I needed a clear image of the mechanism I wanted to create in order for me to succeed, and I didn’t exactly know the pieces that went into a gun, nor how they had to be arranged. I felt like Weapon Transmutation was in fact capable of creating guns, but that I would personally screw it up unless I had a sample mechanism to look at. Hmm, might as well give it a try later anyway. It’s not like failing is going to really waste anything but time, and time is the one thing I have way more of than I’ll probably ever need.I picked Zaien up and sheathed it into the MK-I scabbard.“Not this one,” said the sword. Hmmm… it seems like she(?), actually you know what, screw it. Zaien’s hella girly. She’s probably a she, so let’s just go with that. Anyway, it seems like she doesn’t like it.A part of the problem seemed to be a matter of fit. The sheath was a bit too short, and parts of her blade were still sticking out the top. It seemed a bit too roomy too, since shaking it while she was wearing it led to a bit of rattling.I hadn’t been planning on making the best sheath ever. Zaien was a longsword. Her size made it impossible for me to make use of the sword drawing techniques one would often perform with a regular katana. As such, the sheath probably wouldn’t see that much use. Chances were, I would chuck it in my inventory or simply drop it on the spot after drawing her. But while I wasn’t going for perfect, the first sheath I had created had turned out a little bit too subpar. Alright. Round two! Let’s go!***I ended up producing a good number of scabbards, but none had made me think that it was the one. Zaien seemed to think that she had wasted enough of my time. Each time I pumped out a sheath, she would say that she found it satisfactory, or that she liked it, but the words she spoke directly into my mind were always tinged with dissatisfaction.There was always the option of calling it quits if I felt like we weren’t getting anywhere, but that was the last thing I wanted to do. I made Zaien. She was basically my daughter. Her sheath was the first thing she had ever fussed over. It was my job to see to her happiness. Not doing right by her would make me a horrible father.The sheaths I had produced so far had led me to learn an important lesson. Zaien and I had different tastes. Not all the sheaths I made had been failures in the truest sense of the word. One had turned out fairly badass. It was made of wyvern scales and looked exactly like something you’d see in M*nster Hunter, but she hadn’t liked it. Hmmm… Zaien’s pretty damn girly. Maybe the problem is that everything I’ve made so far appeals to a more masculine aesthetic. I guess I should try crafting something that’s a bit more feminine.I grabbed a mat off the desk and immediately tried putting the idea to work. The result looked as follows:***
Demon Lord’s Experimental Sheath: A scarlet sheath made for a weapon named Zaien by a Demon Lord known as Yuki. There is a blade embedded within the sheath’s tip. As this sheath is fairly sturdy, it will not break unless put under serious pressure.
Quality: A+
***I picked the newly formed sheath up and gave it a good stare. Ooooohhh. Not bad, if I do say so myself.Its shape wasn’t anything impressive. It was fairly simple, but because I’d made so many other sheaths before it, it had actually turned out quite well, craftsmanship wise. I had made it out of a pink shell, and as a result, the whole thing was coloured in a pretty scarlet. It looked like it would go fairly well with Zaien’s crimson blade. Hmmm… The only problem is that Zaien’s handle is just made out of regular wood, so it looks a bit out of place since all the pretty colouring suddenly just turns brown. Maybe I should tie a ribbon or string or something around the handle. That’d probably make gripping it easier too.“What do you think, Enne?” I called Zaien by her new nickname, which more or less sounded exactly like the latter part of her full name. The pet name was one that I had chosen in part because Zaien seemed like an odd thing to call a girl in public given its meaning, and in part because Enne looked much more feminine and therefore matched the blade’s own preferences.The sword spent a few moments feeling her surroundings after being placed within the sheath before sending me the telepathic equivalent of a nod.“It’s really nice,” she said.Heh. Looks like it was just what the doctor ordered. You can really tell she likes this one. Well, that’s the power of pink for you. Girls and pink go hand in hand. I knew making it more feminine was the right idea.It appeared that the sheath was just the right size. Zaien didn’t seem to rattle about when I shook it. Woo! All parameters met!“Mwahahahahaha!” I nodded in satisfaction and began giving myself a metaphorical pat on the back. “How terrifying. My sense of beauty is absolute, for I am able to captivate even children with ease.”For I can see their desires with my mind’s eye. This too is another step down the path of the Demon Lord of Creativity.“Is something wrong…?” asked Enne.“It is but a trifling affair. I am merely basking in the terror of my own talent.”“Uh huh…”I knew that if any of the dungeon’s other residents were around, they would have started cutting in with their retorts and silly complaints the moment I started getting carried away. But Enne, whose people skills were still in the midst of development, simply replied in a way that conveyed a hint of amusement.***TL Note: I haven’t 100% decided on En or Enne. Enn has been suggested, but I personally don’t like it. Enne looks the most feminine, but people who miss the bit on the pronunciation are probably going to think like it’s Ennie or something… En works well with the fact that she’s taciturn. But… Blech. So yeah, I’ve ended up going with Enne for now.<– Prev — Next –>

A New Resident
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“It’s really nice to meet you Enne!” said Illuna.
“Yup! What she said!” agreed Shii.
“Nice… to meet you too.” A girl that was roughly the same height as the other two responded to their greetings in kind. Although her tone was flat, I could tell at a glance that she was having fun.“Watch out Yuuma! There’s three little girls heading this way!” I couldn’t help but suddenly shout something akin to a quote, which caused Lefi, who was standing beside me, to give me a puzzled stare. “Nevermind, pretend you didn’t hear that.”She continued to eye me in confusion for a bit, but eventually shrugged it off and reverted to speaking in her usual tone.“Speak, Yuki.” Lefi looked down at me as she spoke, mostly because she had to. I was sitting before her in the traditional Japanese penal pose known as seiza. I had my legs tugged underneath themselves and arranged parallel to one another with my back straight as a rod. “Why is it that you have abducted yet another young maiden? I demand that you disclose her identity and explain yourself.”The dragon pointed at the young girl happily playing with Illuna and Shii as she spoke. Her black hair, which was glossy as a raven’s coat, was cut into a short, shoulder length bob. Adorning said hair was a red and black ribbon fastened on both sides of her head. Her eyes, which gleamed with the same black as her hair, almost looked like a doll’s. They were cold and indifferent, almost to the point of seeming inorganic. Her features didn’t seem to hint at any sort of emotion. She was basically deadpan.Her thin frame was decorated with Japanese style clothing. Specifically, she was wearing a brilliant red outfit somewhat akin to a jinbei, a type of loose garment normally used as housewear. Her modified jinbei had longer sleeves, which almost made it resemble the type of dress a traditional Japanese shrine maiden would wear. Actually, now that I think about it, it’s probably more like a shrine maiden outfit with a shortened skirt than it is an actual jinbei, huh.All in all, Enne was a young girl with a Japanese aesthetic. The only odd part about her was that, for some reason, she seemed to have an aura of drowsiness. She herself didn’t seem all that sleepy, but people that looked at her would soon start to feel it.“What the hell Lefi! I am not disturbed enough to go around kidnapping kids!”
“You did not abduct her?”
“No! God damn it!”
“Then how, precisely, might you explain her sudden arrival?”
“She’s been here! She’s… her.”I pointed at the weapon by my side. Its handle was decorated with the exact same ribbon that the young girl had in her hair.“You mean to say that the maiden you have presented is none other than Zaien?”
“Yes ma’am.”
“Well Master, you sure have gone and done it again, huh?” Lyuu, who had been watching Lefi interrogate me in much the same manner as usual, flashed an awkward grin.Likewise, Leila watched over the event with her usual cool and collected smile. Although she currently seemed totally calm, the demon had been acting much differently not all that long ago. Seeing Enne’s new form had led her to observe the sword girl with great interest. Her eyes had sparkled as she studied the poor child from all sorts of different angles. The sight had terrified Enne and led her to hide behind me. Honestly, I was pretty spooked too.Now that I think about it, Leila’s really damn good at keeping up appearances. You know, I’m almost kinda wanting to think that the whole super calm and composed thing she’s got going is just a way for her to hide her ravenous thirst for knowledge. Yeahhhhhh, I can definitely see that being a thing.“How bizarre,” said Lefi. “I knew that it was no ordinary intelligent weapon, but this comes as quite the surprise. When was it that it gained the ability to emulate the human form?”
“Ehhh, you know. Pretty recently,” I said. “I figured I might as well check to see if it was possible and well, yeah, turns out it is.”Zaien, or rather Enne, had only become capable of playing with the other two girls because of the Personification skill. She had obtained it by using a skill scroll I had bought for her with DP. Skill scrolls would activate so long as one channelled magical energy through them whilst also keeping their contents in mind. And as such, I began to suspect that Zaien could very well use them given her consciousness and mana pool.I had chosen Personification in particular because I figured that she may as well interact with everyone else if she was going to stay outside. As such, I bought the scroll, pressed it against her blade, and had her try to activate it. And it had actually worked. My suspicions had been on point. Hm, first the sheath, now this. You know, I almost feel like I’m being one of those entitled parents that spoils the hell outta their kids. Actually, on second thought, nah, not really. Swords having sheaths is normal, and I’ve basically been giving everyone skill scrolls. The maids and kids have both gotten a few just ‘cause they seemed useful, so it’s more like I’m just making things fair by treating Enne the same. Yeah, that’s definitely it. I’d feel hella bad for her if she was the only one left out at the end of the day.Although Enne’s personified form had looked like a girl from the very start, she was, in fact, just as genderless as any other inorganic substance. Asking her about it had actually caused an incident, as she had professed that she wasn’t male or female and even tried to strip to prove it. So, fundamentally speaking, Enne was just like Shii. Neither the sword nor the slime had a gender. I mean, it makes sense. Swords kinda don’t sexually reproduce.If you ask me though, I’d definitely say Enne’s a girl. She looks like one, and her tastes are hella girly too. I wasn’t the only one to have such an opinion. Both Illuna and Shii had also seemed to assume that Enne was female on sight. The person, or rather, sword in question didn’t deny any of their claims either. Yeah, I know I said this already, but I’mma just think of her as a girl, fuck it.She herself had also taken rather kindly to identifying as a girl. Though the first body she had created with Personification was definitely genderless, she had later swapped to one that was strictly female. Speaking of Personification, Enne was currently able to maintain her human form for about half a day. And while it was something separate from her main body that she could control remotely, it was fairly limited as it had to remain within a hundred meters of her blade. Makes sense to me, I guess. The skill is just level one after all.I had asked her to keep the skill deactivated before and during hunts. Maintaining it ate away at her mana pool, and I didn’t want to ever get stuck in a situation where she didn’t have enough because she had wasted too much of it. I had felt kind of bad because she had only just gotten her new body, but it turned out that Enne didn’t mind it at all. In fact, she was as far from minding it as could be. The longsword was eager to continue functioning as my weapon. She had stated exactly that in a tone so frantic it had caught me a bit off guard. I mean, I really probably shouldn’t even be thinking this, but seeing quiet girls like her desperately beg for things is a real sight for sore eyes. It was so adorable I couldn’t help but want to indulge her.In the end, I had attributed her attitude to something along the lines of dignity. Fulfilling her role as a weapon was something that seemed to fill her with pride. And here I was trying to figure out what I was going to do if she just wanted to be a normal girl from now on. Well, there goes that. I guess Enne’s going to be staying as my primary weapon of choice. It’s literally what she wants.“Unbelievable.” Hearing my explanation caused Lefi to sigh. “Never in my wildest dreams would I have fathomed that you would create a child with your very own hands for the sole reason that two were not enough to satisfy your twisted needs. I suppose that a part of the fault lies with me. I should not have been so shortsighted as to underestimate the extent of your sexual deviations.”
“Come on Lefi. Can you please stop trying to make me out to be some sort of messed up pervert? ‘Cause I’m really not.”
“Don’t you worry master! Us maids’ll stay loyal ‘n keep servin’ you no matter how perverted you are.”
“Lyuu is exactly right, my lord,” added Leila. “We understand that it is normal for a gentleman to have bizarre fantasies. And we don’t particularly mind no matter how eccentric yours may be.”
“Oh, I see how it is. I get what you’re doing now.” I sighed. “You guys are totally just pretending to be on my side just so I won’t notice you dissing the hell out of me.”Where the hell did Leila learn that bit about men though? I mean, she’s not wrong. Every dude’s got a kink or two. Except for me, of course. I’m a pure, wholesome man without any strange fetishes. And I am definitely not a pedophile. No sir, not at all. I miiiiiiight like thighs just a little bit more than the average dude, but you know, that’s totally normal. I’m not about to sit down and give you the whole lowdown since I’m sure you understand already, but like, who doesn’t like thighs, right?“What’s a diss?” asked Lyuu.Oh, right. I said that in English.“It means talk shit.”
“Oooooohhhh…No worries, Master. We ain’t doin’ any o’ that at all.”
“Bullshit! You wouldn’t be pausing awkwardly or averting your eyes if you were innocent goddammit!”Zzzzz… God damn shitty excuse for a maid. Come on! Maids are not supposed to be dissing the hell out of their masters! And goddammit Leila, stop snickering and say something already! I gave each of the two household servants a reproachful glare in turn.Enne seemed to notice, as she quickly dashed over and wrapped her arms around my head as if to protect me. As I was still sitting in seiza, she didn’t have any difficulty reaching it. “No bullying… Master.”I could feel myself being wrapped up both in her warmth and the sweetness of her scent. Good job Enne! Thank you so much for protecting me from all this tyranny and unjust prejudice.“It’s okay Enne! They’re not bullying him!”Unfortunately, my reinforcements were caught in an ambush. They were forced to face off against an equally powerful foe before they could fend off my assailants.“Really…?” Enne cocked her head to the side as Illuna talked to her with a big smile.
“Uhm… Illuna… I uh…” I spoke a few words to try and protest against the terrible fate I could see looming above the horizon, but it was to no avail.
“Mhm! This is what always happens. This is just how everyone likes to play together! It’s totally normal! So you don’t have to worry.”
“Oh… okay.”
“Uhm… Enne… I uh…” I spoke a few words to try and protest against the terrible fate I could see looming above the horizon, but it was to no avail.Illuna had easily convinced Enne that she was right, and thus, led her back over to Shii so that they could resume their play. My reinforcements had been routed. Illuna please. I know you weren’t trying to be mean, but that was just awful!“It appears that your forces have been exhausted. No more allies will be rushing to your side,” said Lefi.
“Rghhh…” I groaned. “Whatever! Do your worst! This, this is tyranny. I refuse to stand down! And if no one else will help me, then I’ll just have to help myself!” I got out of the traditional Japanese pose of self-reflection and stood up.
“So you refuse to repent?”
“Objection! I never needed to repent to begin with! The only people who repent are those that have done something wrong. Me? I did nothing wrong at all! This is all just bullshit, slander! Why the hell would I need to repent!?”I pointed a finger at her and provided a perfect rebuttal. Heh. No coming back from that one. I’ve got the whole jury convinced.“Nrghhh…Your argument is but predicated on a mere technicality!” Lefi groaned. “Very well. If you wish not to repent, then I shall personally carve the concept of repentance into your flesh. Let us duel, Yuki. Let us do as we often practice and engage in glorious combat with more than merely our prides at stake!”
“Please. You think you can beat me? Do I really need to remind you of our win loss ratio?”
“Hmph.” Lefi crossed her arms and snorted. “Run your mouth while you still can. For I invoke my rights as the winner of our last session to summon a pair of powerful allies. Leila! Lyuu! To me! Together, we shall topple this so-called demon lord.”
“W-What!?” I shouted a word of surprise a manner reminiscent of a villain one would see in anime.The last game Lefi and I had played together was concentration. She had accidentally happened to get a huge chain of matches and straight up win without giving me a chance to retaliate. Pure, unadulterated luck had guided her to victory. Never once would I have imagined that her single lucky win would come back to bite me in the ass.“Huh? We’re playin’ too?” asked Lyuu.
“How fun. I’d love to participate,” said Leila.As far as reinforcements went, Lyuu didn’t actually matter, but Leila? Leila was bad news. Ms. Nonchalant had one hell of a head on her shoulders. She had squeezed way more victories out of me than I had her.“Fine…. Fine,” I said. “I’ll show you that demon lords are men who triumph in the face of adversity. You think that having three of you will let you beat me? Hell no! I’ll destroy that fucked up illusion of yours!”I quoted a line that a certain high school student often said right at the climax of an arc before setting up an arena, though all that was really composed of was arranging a few pieces on a board. Once all the preparations were complete, I took to the battlefield and marched into a world where strategy and deception triumphed above martial skill.Though no one had caught sight of it, seeing the dungeon’s residents make merry had brought a small smile to Enne’s face.***TL NoteI’m going to stop pointing out all the references in the text.

A Draconic Date — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Yuki, I wish to invite you on a date.”
“Sure, let’s g—” I casually nodded along to Lefi’s words, as usual, only to suddenly stop as I finally processed them. “Wait. What?”
“Did you perhaps provide an answer without listening to what I said?” Lefi’s tone didn’t really change. She knew it was the usual. “I suggested that we engage in the experience known as a date.”
“Uh… Uhm… Sure…” My brain had ground to a halt. It took me a good while to squeeze out an answer. Wait. A date? Like, a date date? Wait, wait, wait. Calm down Yuki. Don’t let yourself get too excited.I had the sneaking suspicion that the dragon girl would flash me a shit-eating grin just to piss me off the moment I let myself get carried away. Alright Yuki, you can do this. Keep calm. Take it easy. Deep breaths.“S-So where do you wanna go?” I stuttered at first, but otherwise managed to speak in my usual tone. I had succeeded in containing most of my excitement.
“Our destination is one of the mountains beyond the one we inhabit.”
“Oh, so we’re going hiking? That sounds like it could be fun.”
“Hiking? I see no reason for such an endeavour. We shall fly.”Oh yeah. Derp. I almost forgot I had wings. But flying, huh? I guess that means we’re going on a sky date. Yeah, that’s nice. I like the sound of that.“Wait… destination? Are we going somewhere specific?” I asked.
“Indeed. There happens to be a colony of bees on that mountain, one that I have not visited in many a month. I believe that it has come time for me to pay it a visit.”…Wait a second.“Bees?”
“Precisely. I must say that the honey they produce is quite delectable. I do enjoy the sweets that you provide, but my time away from the sweet nectar has led me to desire it. I would like to harvest it and present it to Leila such that she may use it to craft a delectable dessert.”I had no words to say. Seeing the blissful look she had on her face as she talked about how much she liked the honey took me from flustered to calm in a matter of moments. Oh. I see how it is.“Let us visit it together, Yuki.”
“…Don’t wanna.” I paused before refusing much in the same manner as a child throwing a tantrum. I laid down on the spot and turned to face away from Lefi. All my excitement was gone with the wind.
“What!? Why ever would you refuse!?” The dragon, who had expected everything but refusal, responded in an upset, flustered tone. She immediately moved to the side I was facing and tried to look at me, but I rolled over again in order to avoid meeting her gaze.
“I don’t care about honey.”
“I-I assure you that it is the most delicious honey that this world has to offer. I have no doubts that you will enjoy it.” Lefi mounted my thighs in order to stop me from turning and peeked at my face, but I craned my neck and continued to avoid looking at her.
“Don’t care. I don’t like sweets that much anyway,” I pouted.
“Rghhh…” Lefi groaned as she tried to come up with another excuse to drag me along. “Y-your beloved other half is thirsting for honey. Is it not your duty as my partner to grant my wishes?”I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to be the judge of whether someone else thinks of you as beloved, Lefi. And whaddya mean partner? Are we supposed to be some sort of stand up comedy duo that does sketches for laughs and cash or something?“Even if I am your partner or whatever, I don’t see how going benefits me in any which way.”
“E-Even if I was to offer to permit you to sleep by my side in exchange?” said Lefi with a blush.
“Was that supposed to sweeten the deal or something? ‘Cause it doesn’t.”
“Ngrah!?”The unexpected reply caused the supreme dragon to make a strange sound to express her shock. She looked down at me and stared. It took a while, but she eventually caught on to the fact that I had no intention of moving whatsoever, a conclusion that led to her groan.“All I wished for was for us to spend time with only each other at our sides…” she muttered under her breath.She said it extremely quietly. I could tell that it wasn’t something she had intended for me to hear. But being a demon lord, my senses were extremely sharp. I was capable of hearing the heartbeats of anyone nearby, so the words she had whispered were as clear as day. Wait…Was that why she’d asked me out to begin with? Probably, actually. Man, this would’ve been much easier if she said it straight from the start. Oh wait. Right. She’s awkward and not really used to this kinda stuff yet. Riiiiiiiiight.After heaving a small sigh, I sat up. Since she was sitting on my thighs, my face had ended up basically right in front of hers.“Ngh!?” She made another weird sound to illustrate her surprise as we exchanged a glance from almost point blank.
“Fiiiiine, I’ll come,” I said in an exaggerated demonstration of unwillingness. “But you’re going to have to keep that promise of yours and be a damn good body pillow.”
“B-body pillow!?” She squeaked in surprise but immediately faked a cough and then kept talking as if it had never happened. “V-Very well. I suppose that, as one that comprehends the spirit of magnanimity, I shall permit you to see your request granted.”She was trying her best to fake composure, but the way her tail was twitching made it as obvious as could be that she was feeling rather flustered. Smiling, I took her by the hand and got up off the ground.<– Prev — Next –>

A Draconic Date — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerThe sun shone down on us from up above as Lefi and I soared through the sky. Warm winds wrapped themselves against our faces and our shoulders before flying right by. Beneath us lay a landscape that possessed all the majesty nature had to offer, a landscape that extended for as far as the eye could see. There were beautiful lakes that glimmered as the sun’s rays reflected off of them, large fields where the grass swayed in the wind, and deep ravines with rivers roaring right through them.There weren’t too many creatures out and about, but some had started inhabiting the region again now that Lefi had basically turned herself into a shut-in. I happened to spot something that resembled a deer taking a drink at the riverbank, as well as a horse taking it easy as it sat around in a field of grass. Hints of wildlife were scattered all over the region.Everything before my eyes came together to form a single scene so perfect and cohesive that I wanted to label it as a bonafide work of art. Even just gazing upon it got my heart pumping with excitement. You know, I basically think this every single time, but learning to fly was one of the best choices I’ve ever made. Being airborne just feels so… good.Only after experiencing flight for myself did I finally truly understand those that longed for the skies. I now understood why Icarus had crafted wings of wax and why the Wright brothers so fervently pursued the creation of an aircraft. I guess this is how pilots and stuff must’ve felt back on Earth. Flying just… makes me feel so many different things I can’t even begin to describe them all.I looked beside me as I savoured the sensation of flying. I looked past both my black wings and my red and black ones and gazed upon the dragon girl flying next to me. Unlike mine, her wings glimmered with a silver sheen. And unlike mine, they almost seemed to be sculpted. They were so beautiful I suspected that they’d been artificially created with perfection in mind. The way Lefi looked as she flew was a far cry from her usual, slovenly self. She was so majestic and beautiful that my eyes couldn’t help but find themselves drawn to her. You know… getting to see her like this more or less already makes this whole trip well worth it.“Why ever are you staring at me? Could you not help but be fascinated by my charm?”
“Uh huh. Tooooootally,” I said. “You’re incredibly beautiful, Lefi.”
“Eh!? Uhm…” Lefi started to panic. She suddenly flushed a deep shade of red and stuttered as she tried to figure out a reply. “T-Thanks.”Oh come on, Lefi. What the heck? Weren’t you the one that suggested it? Stop with all the blushing. You’re going to make me start blushing too.“A-Anyway, it looks like we’ve flown over our mountain.” I immediately tried to steer the conversation in a new direction. “Where exactly are we going again?”
“O-our destination is already within sight.” Grasping my intentions immediately, the dragon joined in on trying to dispel the awkwardness. “It lies upon that mountain.”She pointed at the tallest mountain in the massive range that was laid out before us as she spoke. It was so tall that I couldn’t see its peak despite being airborne. The giant rocky piece of terrain shot well up above the clouds. I had cast more than just a few glances at it from far off in the distance, and I had always thought that it was big, but approaching it really emphasized its size. Oh man. That’s one heck of a mountain right there. Holy shit.“My old nest was atop this mountain’s peak,” said Lefi.
“That’s really high up,” I said, impressed. “I kinda want to check it out. Would you mind showing me around?”
“There is little to see but formations of rock.” The dragon girl cocked an eyebrow. She didn’t quite seem to understand my motivations.
“Doesn’t matter,” I replied with a smile. “I still want to see it anyway. Since it’s where you used to live.”
“I-If you insist,” said Lefi. For some odd reason, her cheeks had turned a bit red, but she suddenly sped up drastically before I could get a good look at her. “I shall show you the place I once called home. Do not fall behind.”
“Huh!? Wait up!” I hit the gas and tried my best to keep up.***“Are… we… finally… here…?” I panted. We had almost reached the mountain’s apex. Lefi had guided me through a series of clouds and up along a stone face that led to its peak.
“I am surprised to see you already so exhausted,” she said in half amazement, half exasperation.
“Iunno what… you were expecting…” I said. “The air here… is really thin…”The air had done exactly as I expected and grown thinner as we got higher into the sky. It was the first time I had ever gone so far up. My lungs desperately craved oxygen. Wait, why’s Lefi fine? Hmm… I guess dragons are probably just built differently or something. I mean, they are supposed to more or less rule the skies and whatnot, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they just happened to be adapted to it. Man, I’m so jelly. I wish I could have a body that’s got no problem being this high up.Though I had voiced a whole series of complaints, my body had in fact already started to adapt to high altitudes. I seemed to be getting used to the lack of oxygen, as every minute that passed made it easier for me to breathe. Welp. That’s just what it means to be a Demon Lord, I guess. I hope I get even more adapted to this kinda stuff next time I evolve.We reached the summit after a few more moments of travel and landed in an area that I could only describe as rocky. Beneath us was naught but a sea of clouds. I could only very occasionally see the earth below peeking through the gaps.“Woah. So this is your old nest…?” My eyes lit up with curiosity as I examined my surroundings.
“Quite the uninteresting sight, is it not?” shrugged Lefi.I wasn’t able to tell her that she was wrong. The entire summit was more or less decorated with nothing but large brown rocks. Sad enough as it was to say, the most noteworthy thing about them was their size, as many were as big as Lefi was in her dragon form. All in all, the scene was dreary, bland, and boring.“Yeah, I admit it’s not all that interesting, but I’m glad I came here,” I said. It didn’t take an expert to realize that the place was well lived in. Lefi had obviously messed with a few things in order to make it easier for her to carry out her day to day activities. One of the rocks seemed like it was likely used as a table, as its surface had been cut perfectly flat. There was also another pile of rocks that had been hollowed out to create an overhang large enough to cover a full grown dragon. Looking closer, I noticed that there were silver scales and sharp fangs strewn all over. I could tell at a glance that they were Lefi’s, as they had yet to lose their shine.The signs all pointed towards her residence. And seeing them left me feeling deeply moved. It was a strange feeling, one I couldn’t quite put into words, but I could feel it welling up within the depths of my heart nonetheless.“Really?” she asked as she turned to me.
“Really.”
“How strange you are,” said Lefi with a chuckle.Once Lefi was done laughing, she rested her head on one of my shoulders.Neither of us said much more. We remained silent and allowed our actions to speak for us.***“Soooo… Ms. Dragon,” I addressed the silver-haired girl as I looked down what appeared to be a steep slope leading down from the summit. “Mind explaining what all this is?”I had happened upon it in the middle of examining her property in greater detail. A wide variety of items lay directly beneath it.“Those?” said Lefi as she glanced over. “They are but the remains of the fools that scaled this mountain to challenge me.”The messy heap of weapons and armour almost seemed to resemble a dump. Everything there had seemed to have been carelessly tossed over the edge without much concern. But although they had been worn down as a result of mistreatment, the items in question weren’t of a terrible quality. In fact, some were so well made that they still shone a beautiful silver to this day. Some of those definitely do not look even remotely human-sized. I figured that there’d probably be races like that. I kinda want to see them for myself one day.There was an incredible number of items present, but I didn’t see even a single set of bones amongst the pile, which meant their owners had likely long decayed and returned to the earth.“Wow…” I blinked a few times as I stared. “There sure were a hell of a lot of idiots…”I hadn’t done anything beyond give the pile a casual glance, but it seemed like there were easily at least a couple hundred different sets of equipment. I almost couldn’t believe it. Several hundred morons had pushed themselves through the gruelling task of climbing a massive mountain that didn’t have much in the way of air. And then, despite the sweat-dripping journey, they were easily put down the moment they reached the summit.“I know not their origins, but there were once tales that stated that partaking of my blood would grant eternal youth and overwhelming power. False as they were, many believed them and sought my vital fluids for themselves. While removing my attackers was but a simple task, I found their persistence to be quite the annoyance,” said Lefi in a fed up tone.While the rumours about Lefi’s blood were false, I didn’t think that anyone that happened to succeed would have gone home completely empty-handed. Lefi’s scales and fangs were materials of the highest grade. Equipment forged with Lefi-based materials as the base likely would have proven themselves as the world’s most powerful. I can kinda see how the whole eternal youth stuff was a thing though. That was how myths went back in my world too. People had always thought that eating mysterious creatures like mermaids, kappas, and tengus would let you stay young and live forever.“I do not mind if you claim any spoils you desire. You may even retrieve all of it if you so wish,” said Lefi as she looked at the loot.
“Uhhh… you sure?”
“I never once considered it my property,” said Lefi. “I merely regarded it as trash and treated it as such. I do believe that you will find some of the items quite impressive. Though, powerful as they are, they remain unable to lay even a scratch upon my scales.”Seeing the triumphant look on her face prompted me to force an awkward smile.“Well… I guess I’ll take you up on that offer then.”
“Very well. Then it is all yours to take.”I immediately started to stash everything inside of my inventory. Some of the equips looked like the stuff you’d only ever see at an end game in RPGs, but I wasn’t planning on using any of it nonetheless. I had Zaien, and I had no intention of switching her out for some other weapon. I’ll probably keep the higher tier stuff around as references and just turn everything else into DP. Heh. Oh man, I can already smell the cash. The stuff I looted off those bandits had already got me a pretty penny. I’m sure having all this will let me make myself a fortune. I’ll finally be able to summon all four of the monsters I’ve been eyeing. Oh man, I can’t wait. I’mma pawn this shit off for cash the moment I get back.Now, now, dead dudes, I know what you’re thinking. Your weapons and armour are valuable historical artifacts that have a whole bunch of inherent value. Blah blah blah. Yeah, I don’t give two fucks. Historical value can go eat shit. I’m a demon lord. All I care about is myself. If the dungeon takes it, then I’m turning it into cold hard cash, er, DP. Period. And before you start bitching, consider this: this is all your own god damn fault for being dumb enough to climb this big ass mountain to begin with.“So uhmm…”
“What is it?”
“Do you mind if I take your fangs and scales too, while I’m at it?”
“I do not see any reason to refuse,” said Lefi. Though she hadn’t said no, the way she was looking at me made it clear that she was wondering exactly what I was up to.I scratched my cheek in an expression of embarrassment as I began to explain.“Well, I was kinda thinking of, y’know, making everyone matching daggers so they can defend themselves and stuff just in case. I’m sure they’d turn out really well if we used your mats as the base, so… yeah. And I also kinda really just want to have them.”I was aware that my thoughts were getting a little bit wild. Wanting stuff just because it happened to be a part of her body at some point in time was more or less borderline psychotic. I was totally aware of that fact, so my voice had slowly started trailing off at the end, but the blush on her face made it obvious that she had heard me loud and clear either way.“V-very well. I-I suppose that I shall let you have them then,” she stuttered. “You are correct in your assumption that weapons made from my fangs and scales would make excellent equipment. My scales are harder than even divine steel, and the only weapons capable of harming them are my very own fangs. I grant you full permission to make use of them, for like all else that lies here, I view the fangs and scales that I have shed as naught but garbage.”
“Thanks, Lefi. I’ll definitely make something real good. Just you wait!”Oh man, I’m so excited. You know what? I might as well throw in all the like legendary class items I looted earlier while I’m at it. God damn, these daggers are going to turn out so well. Again, I have zero intention of switching Zaien out. I really don’t want to see her cry, after all, but I’m sure she’ll forgive me if all I do is add one more dagger to my repertoire. I’ve got enough materials to make something for everyone, Lefi included. Oh man, I can’t wait. Matching overpowered as fuck daggers ahoy!I ran around and started shoving everything in my inventory shortly after thanking Lefi. I didn’t even bother trying to contain my enthusiasm. Though the look on the dragon girl’s face remained one of astounding exasperation as she watched over me, I could still feel the warmth lingering in her gaze.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Man, it’s been a while, hasn’t it? I know, I know, everyone missed me (read: Nirvash), but I can explain. See, I went to Anime Matsuri and that burned me out, so when I got home, I didn’t really have any spare brainpower to come up with scripts for the show. So I’m sorry about that. Man, the last time I had the show, it was chapter 117. Which is pretty cool, because that’s the number of THE Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, of Halo fame. Okay, I need to try and get to these questions, but since it’s been a while, forgive me if I miss you. So thanks to kx, AntsCool, CaTastrophy427, FranckOA, topkek99, zekkendo, Mischa, kx again, Makisma fan in disguise (even though Boss answered you before I could), kx yet again, and Teivel for all your questions. Remember, if I missed you, I’m sorry. The convention is over, I’ve recovered and should be back on top of all this. If you’ve got a question, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker. See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

A Draconic Date — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerExploring Lefi’s old home had provided a more than notable number of high-quality items. And so, I found myself in an incredibly good mood as we moved onto the goal we had set out to accomplish: harvesting honey.“So? Where exactly are these bees or whatever you were looking for anyway?” I asked as I turned to the girl flying by my side.
“My advent often results in the partial destruction of their hive, and as such, they are prone to moving after each time I lay claim to their nectar. While I know not its current position, seeking it is but a simple task. I am certain that you too will soon come to understand. Their hives are quite distinctive.”I didn’t know all that much about bees nor their hives, so I decided to just leave the task of finding the place in Lefi’s hands. But you know what, Lefi’s helped me get a lot of good shit, so I’ll make sure I pay her back in kind.“Alright, let’s do this!”
“Have you finally decided to invest your energy into the endeavour?”
“Yeah, I owe you for all the weapons, scales, and stuff, so I might as well go all out and get you as much honey as I can.”
“I suppose I shall be relying on you then,” chuckled Lefi. “Let us get to work immediately. I have spotted the hive.”
“Already?”I followed Lefi as she glided down the side of a mountain and landed on a platform underneath a tall cliff, one that was deep into the mountains. And then, I saw it, a massive golden pond. The pool of honey was a bit too small to be called a lake, but it was still of an impressive size nonetheless. Around it lingered a sweet, sugary scent, the same kind that would waft off a syrupy pancake. I guess that’s what she meant by distinctive.“Is that whole thing made out of honey?”
“It is as per your conjectures. The golden nectar before you is none other than the honey that I have come to seek.”
“I thought honey was supposed to come from beehives…”Then again, this isn’t exactly Earth. I guess I’ll just have to live with the fact that this world’s bees just store their honey in lakes or whatever instead.“It is a part of a hive. Bees create reservoirs of honey like the one before us near their nests,” said Lefi.Wow. This world’s bees sure are daring, leaving their food stores out in the open like that.…Wait a second. Just how big are these goddamn bees? They’ve gotta be pretty damn huge to be able to literally dig up a whole pond’s worth of space. Where the hell are they anyway? Like, there’s no way we’d find ourselves an empty beehive with a bunch of food saved up if there aren’t any bees nearby, right?“So…” I timidly directed my question towards the silver-haired dragon. “Where exactly are the bees that own this place anyways?”
“I shall be relying on you,” Lefi’s reply was to flash a grin whilst repeating a line she had said not too long ago.I almost felt like I had jinxed it. I heard a loud buzzing off in the distance the moment she finished replying. The skill I had that detected enemy presences began to blare as dozens of bees began directing their malice at us. Half-panicked, I turned in the direction it was all coming from, only to see the bees that I had been trying to locate. They were huge. More than huge. Each insect was the size of a large motorbike capable of easily carrying two. Their stingers were so large that they may as well have been lances.And there were a countless number of them. A literal army of the creatures crawled out of a giant hole halfway up the cliff, a cave, possibly even one of their own design.“Wah I uah da!?” I shouted a bunch of half-formed words as I was assaulted by a sudden combination of panic and confusion. The cave was likely their nest, and so many of the creatures had exited it that I was starting to wonder about the number that had been crammed inside the damned thing to begin with. Regardless of how many there were, one thing remained unchanged. Every bee that left the cave flew right at us with the intention of brutally murdering the intruders that dared attempt to steal their honey.“I shall leave them to you as I focus on the harvest,” said Lefi.
“What!? Seriously!? You’re just going to sit around!?”The dragon casually disregarded my complaints, created several glass bottles out of dirt, and happily began filling them with honey. With no more time to spare, I reached into my inventory and drew Zaien.“Go time?” asked the sword.
“Yeah! I’m counting on you Enne!” I shouted. “Let’s give ‘em a full power blast right away!”I immediately began channelling a copious amount of magical energy into the blade as I activated the magic circuit known as Crimson Blaze. Though the sword now possessed a clear consciousness, I still more or less used her the same way. That said, she did function a bit differently. Her newfound ability to devise clear thought allowed her to aid me in activating Crimson Blaze, which sped up the process drastically, especially since it was now considered a skill. She could use it up to five times by herself and unlike before, she now had control over the fire. One direct result of her manual override was that the flames could now cover a much larger area if need be.After activating the magic circuit-cum-skill, I cut one of the nearby bees in half with Enne’s edge, splitting it in half. Seething hot embers rose from its body as it suddenly erupted into a deadly conflagration, a flaming tornado that set every insect in the vicinity on fire. The temperature rose. My whole body was drenched in a wave of heat.The bees that were swallowed by the flames began dropping like flies as the heat ate away at them. It’s super effective! Heh, I knew bug-types would be weak to fire-type attacks. Such is the fate of an insect.“That worked welloah!” I raised my voice as I parried the stinger that had suddenly driven itself towards my flank and deprived the offender of its head. “That was close.”It seemed like the specific bee in question had gone around the flames in order to attack me. Man, I almost got hit there. Not that it matters. They seem pretty weak, so I’m sure I could tank a few.“You would do well to remain cautious of their sting. They are powerful enough to cleave through steel and contain a potent poison,” said Lefi. “Do not allow yourself to be so much as scratched, Yuki. For as you are now, the poison will take no more than ten minutes to seal your fate.”
“What the fuck!? Tell me ahead of time goddammit!” I shouted. Holy shit, that was close. I was about to let my guard down and get myself rekt by bees. Good thing we don’t have to deal with these for all that much longer. That big ass fire took care of most of the—wait a second. Why the hell are there still so many goddamn bees!?A group of the insects emerged from the flame as I yelled at Lefi. They had gathered up to form a solid lump of bodies in order to keep as many of their horde safe from the flame as possible. The bees were still going strong. And my attack had effectively drawn all their aggro. They completely ignored the dragon girl and began swarming me en masse. Oh god, why? Why are there so many of these things!? Seeing all these stupid ass creepy crawlies is giving me goosebumps!I continued swinging my blade and casting Crimson Blaze as I avoided stinger after stinger after stinger. Lefi, on the other hand, continued delivering bad news while remaining on the sidelines.“My efforts in harvesting their honey have led these bees to develop quite the intellect,” she said. “I must thank you for handling them for me. I no longer need to concern myself with avoiding their outright extermination as I kick them about. Your presence renders harvesting their honey a much simpler task.”
“Damn it, Lefi! This stupidly good teamwork is all your fault!?”The bees worked so well together that I couldn’t help but find myself annoyed. Any bee that charged at me head on was always accompanied by two more. One would rush at my left flank, while the other rushed at my right in order to prevent me from getting away. Some even acted like assassins. They hid behind their buddies and struck the moment I showed any sort of opening. Coordination only began to describe their movements. They never flinched in the face of danger, and they never reacted to their allies deaths with shock. They kept pushing forward and assailing me nonstop regardless of what happened. I hate this. Fighting these things is a royal pain in the ass.Like Lefi had said, the bees were smart, absurdly smart. Their actions were so cohesive that it was almost as if the entire swarm was but a single organism. Why, why are there so many bugs? I can already feel myself developing some sort of insectophobia. Hell, this is probably going to give me PTSD. My goosebumps aren’t going away. I might even end up turning myself into Bugman at this rate. I’ll even have a Bugcave and everything.“I shall leave our aggressors in your hands, partner of mine,” said Lefi. “And I thank you for the efforts that you have put into defending my desires.”
“Partner this, partner that! You’re literally only calling me that just because it makes it more convenient for you to push things off onto me, aren’t you!?”
“Please do take the battle a bit further away. I do not wish to see the honey contaminated, and I fear that standing so close raises the risk of it.”
“How about you worry about me instead of some stupid goddamn honey!?”Fuck! I never should’ve told her that I’d try my best or whatever. God damn it, past Yuki! Why the hell did you have to go ahead and say something so stupid!? You know what, Lefi? Fine! Whatever! You want me to fight these stupid bugs, I’ll fight these stupid bugs. But I’ll get you back for this later! Don’t even dream of being let off the hook!I spent a good while fighting. I rolled around, flew about, and used every single part of my body to fend off the swarm of bees. Each of the countless corpses strewn all over the ground was accompanied by a pair of still healthy bees with their eyes set on my death.“God damn it, Lefi! How are you still not done!?” I screamed. “What the hell’s keeping you!?”
“I shan’t be too long,” said Lefi with a moan. “I am merely enjoying the sweet taste of this delicious honey.”
“What the fuck!? Are you seriously just sitting around and eating with your feet kicked up!? Stop that and help me you lazy piece of shit!”
“How incredibly rude,” said Lefi. “I suppose I may as well continue to dawdle and enjoy myself if you wish not to pay me any respect.”
“My apologies, mademoiselle. Yet another weak soldier I might be, I humbly request that you might display your martial prowess.”
“What a jarring display,” said the dragon. “Polite as it may have been, your manner of speech leaves me with a sense of dissonance, and as such, I shalln’t comply with your request for aid.”
“Fuck you!!” I screamed.Lefi chuckled and watched me desperately struggle for just a little while longer before finally getting up. She made an expression of exasperation and heaved an exaggerated shrug as she did. “I suppose it cannot be helped. I shall do you the favour of demonstrating the might of the one known as the Supreme Dragon.”
“Sure! Whatever you say, Lefi, just hurry up already!” The look on her face pissed me off to no end, but I gritted my teeth and resisted the urge to talk back. I knew she would likely intentionally refrain from helping me if I did.The ever so amazing Supreme Dragon smiled fearlessly and opened her mouth as wide as it would go. An extensive amount of mana suddenly gathered in her mouth.And then, in the next moment, it happened.A beam. A Hyper Beam. The kind dragon-types were known for firing.The laser that left Lefi’s mouth was so thick and dense with power that it put even the most powerful Specium Ray to shame.The air shook.The atmosphere trembled as the thunderous roar that accompanied the blast flooded our surroundings with noise. I couldn’t help but clasp my hands over my ears as I tried to endure it.Not a single one of the bees hit directly by the attack remained. There weren’t even ashes. They had been completely obliterated, erased without a trace. And the same had happened to the mountain. There was a huge hole in the side of the cliff. It almost reminded me of a Japanese coin, the kind with a perfectly round hole in the middle. I could see the sky peeking out from the other side of the rock. Nothing was left. Bees, rock, everything. Everything had been completely evaporated.Even the bees that hadn’t been hit by the attack were down for the count. They were literally blown away by the sonic booms the attack had created. They convulsed on the ground, twitching and spasming before finally falling still. It didn’t seem like she had killed literally all of them, but she had at least disabled everything in the area but me and her.“Behold, Yuki. For this is the aftermath of a dragon’s roar, my race’s most powerful spell.”The scene of the carnage was met with a triumphant laugh and a cocky smile, but I was too busy staring at the destruction with an unamused look on my face to see much of either.“I mean, I can see that it’s hella strong and all that, Lefi, but…”
“But?”
“Why didn’t you use it earlier?”
“I would have, had you not so coldly turned down my initial invitation.”
“I knew it! I fucking knew it! You put me through all that bullshit just ‘cause of some stupid grudge!”My frustrated, angry screams were loud enough to be heard for miles.***“Nnnggh… mmmrphh…”A series of warm breaths tickled my earlobe as Lefi twitched and moaned.“I-I was mistaken, Yuki,” she stammered. “I admit my wrongdoings, so p-please, you must release me!”
“Ahhh…” I heaved a sigh of relaxation. “This sure is a nice body pillow. Best I’ve ever had, in fact.”
“Y-Yuki…! L-Listen to me…!” she said between moans. “If you can hear my voice, then you must respond!”
“La la laahhh. I can’t hear anything, so I’m not going to respond.”
“Yuki!? Yuki!!”I ignored Lefi, who was begging for forgiveness as she squirmed around with her cheeks red, and continued to trace my fingers along her wings. I allowed myself to enjoy the sensation on my fingers before rubbing my face into the soft material. It was night time; we had come home from harvesting honey. I had offered to groom Lefi’s wings, so she complied and materialized them. And in doing so, she fell for the plot I had devised, hook, line, and sinker. I immediately grabbed her and turned her into my pillow for the night before she could retract them. I brought her over to the futon I used as a bed and took my time enjoying one of the most sensitive parts of her body.Generally speaking, Lefi was capable of materializing and retracting her wings at will, but my experiences taught me that there were exceptions to the rule. They were sensitive, so it was more or less impossible to retract if they were being touched. Hence her current predicament. She wanted to retract her wings and hide them from me, but she couldn’t because I was still messing around with them.“Hmmm… I guess I should probably play with your tail a bit too,” I said. “Oh wow, this also feels really nice to the touch.”
“D-Do not stroke my tail!” she protested.
“Sure. I’ll go right back to touching your wings then, I guess.”
“That is even worse!”And so, I continued to stare at and enjoy the warmth of my teary-eyed, Lefi brand body pillow until I was whisked away into the land of dreams.As an aside, the honey really had turned out to be as good as the dragon had claimed.<– Prev — Next –>

A Day In the Life of a Little Girl — Part 1
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“I was unable to catch even a wink of sleep last night, and it is all your fault!” shouted Lefi. “I cannot believe you! You continued to fondle my wings even after falling asleep!”
“What can I say, they just felt so nice that I couldn’t stop,” said Yuki. “If anything, you should take it as a compliment. It just means your wings feel that good.”
“I-I suppose,” said Lefi, with a blush. “Wait…! I shan’t fall for that trick!”
“Yuki! Lefi!” Illuna shouted to get the pair’s attention, but they were too busy arguing to notice. “Hmm… they’re not listening.”The little girl frowned before turning to one of her other adoptive siblings instead. “Leila! I’m going out to play!”
“Me too!” said Shii.
“Come on Enne, let’s go have fun!” said Illuna.
“Okay. I’m coming,” said Enne.
“Have fun out there,” said Leila. Seeing the three run off as a happy group caused the sheep-horned demon to smile in the same way she always did. “Do be careful, and don’t go any further than the plains, okay?”
“Okay!” two of the three replied vocally, while the last answered with a small nod as all three made their way out the door.***“Wow…” Though it remained mostly as expressionless as usual, Enne’s face almost seemed to convey a sense of wonder as she looked up at the castle. The way it towered over its surroundings could only be described as majestic.Seeing the new girl act the way she did led Illuna to giggle before speaking in a tone tinged with pride. “Yuki’s castle sure is cool, isn’t it?”The purpose of today’s excursion was to show Enne around the castle. And that was why their first destination had been the plains, where one could take in the whole thing at once. Enne often went out with Yuki, but she had always just been a weapon, and one without a sheath at that, so she had been stuck in his inventory with no real way to look around. She had barely known what the dungeon’s interior looked like.She had obtained a scabbard relatively recently, so she no longer needed to remain inside Yuki’s item box during transport, but she still ended up getting carried around, so she never had much of a chance to explore.But now, she had a body. She could go wherever she wanted. That was why Yuki had told Illuna to help show the new girl around the castle. Illuna had easily agreed. As far as she was concerned, she was everyone’s big sister, and duties like the one she was given were just a part of the job. Yuki had told the vampire that he didn’t plan on going out today, so she had decided to take the opportunity to finally get around to what he had asked her to do.Looking to her side, the vampire found Enne enthralled by the sight. It was an impressive one, even Illuna herself had to crane her head as far up as it would go if she wanted to see the top of the castle. Looking up inspired Illuna to think of the person who had made it all, her big brother. He was amazing. The castle looked like something out of a fairy tale, and yet, he had made it really quickly right in front of her.And equally as amazing was the big sister of hers that helped him. Out of the three she had, Lefi was the one that Illuna was most attached to. Though she was young, and though she loved them both, even Illuna could quite easily tell that they weren’t exactly what one could be called normal. They were different from other people. They were both kinda weird. And though they were weird, they were weird in the same way. She had always thought that they were very much alike.One of the bizarre incidents had actually happened just earlier in the morning. Yuki and Lefi had slept in the same bed, and they had both slept in really late. They got along so well that Illuna ended up looking at them with a childish envy. She wished she could have joined them. Yet, for some odd reason, the two had started to argue the moment they got up. It really made Illuna wonder why they couldn’t do what her parents did and just be all smiley and happy after every time they shared a bed. She remembered that her parents would always like looking into each other’s eyes the next morning, so she was really confused.She asked both her smart but carefree big sister, Leila, as well as her scatterbrained, kind, and fun big sister, Lyuu, but neither provided her answers she really understood.Leila’s response had been, “they’re getting along quite well, just in their own way,” whereas Lyuu had said that “it’s just ‘cause love comes in lots o’ different forms.”Illuna thought long and hard about what they meant, but she didn’t quite get it. Still, she could at least tell that Yuki and Lefi were still kinda getting along just by looking at the way they acted around each other, so she just shrugged off her confusion and accepted it for what it was.“Look! Over there!” Shii, who, like Illuna, had been standing beside Enne, suddenly turned around. “It’s Rei, Rui, and Lowe!”The vampire followed the slime’s lead and directed her gaze towards her three half transparent friends. They were a bit younger than her, and they floated instead of walking around. Like Shii, they had both been born because of Yuki’s mysterious powers. According to him, they were wraiths.Illuna had actually freaked out the first time she saw them. She had thought they were ghosts and panicked. But it turned out that the three of them were all really nice and fun to hang out with, so her aversion to them had soon disappeared. They played together all the time. And though they were good friends, Illuna knew not to let her guard down around them. All three of the girls really liked pranks, so they would often try to startle Illuna and Shii by catching them unawares. Most of these incidents would quickly transition into games of tag. The wraith girls would run away right after their pranks, and Illuna and Shii would chase after them.As they were sisters, the three ghost girls looked fairly similar, but they were still easy to distinguish because of how different their personalities were.Rei, the oldest, acted as a big sister should. She was smart and usually had everything sorted out in her head. She would mediate arguments between her two younger siblings whenever it was necessary. However, she loved pranks, and she would often put together complicated tricks and rope her sisters into helping her perform them.Rui, the middle sister, was of the more stubborn breed. She was both the most prideful and the most honest of the bunch. Her sisters’ shenanigans would often cause her to panic.And then there was Lowe, the youngest of the three. Like Enne, she had the tendency to be relatively quiet and reserved. But she was also much more mischievous than her two older siblings. The pranks she pulled would often leave both other wraiths shocked stiff.Illuna didn’t find it strange that the three had completely different personalities, nor did she ever question why they were siblings, and why they had specified who was oldest despite being summoned all at once. Her older brother, however, found these questions extremely confusing. They were the kinds of things that kept him up at night.“Enne, meet Rei, Rui, and Lowe! Wraith girls, meet Enne! Now let’s all get along!” said Illuna.None of the three spectral monsters could talk, but it was fairly easy to tell what they wanted to say given the way they floated around the new girl with welcoming, happy smiles plastered all over their faces.“Nice to meet you.” said Enne. She seemed to understand that she was being welcomed. There weren’t any changes in her expression, but she seemed to be happy nonetheless.
“We’re in the middle of showing Enne around the castle right now! Do you girls want to join us?” asked Illuna.Though the vampire had spent a good amount of time exploring its interior, she doubted she knew as much about it as the wraith girls. Unlike her, they didn’t live in the true throne room. The whole castle was their home. It wasn’t as if Illuna hadn’t memorized its layout. Rather, the problem was that the layout Illuna memorized was outdated.Her beloved older brother renovated the castle on a near-everyday basis. Walls would often suddenly turn into corridors. New rooms would pop up out of nowhere, and sometimes, she’d even find entire new buildings. It wasn’t just the interiors that changed either. Plain courtyards would transform into beautiful gardens. Flowerbeds and ponds would suddenly show up where there wasn’t anything before. Landmarks were unreliable and often subject to change. The castle was like a labyrinth. While those attempting to clear the dungeon may have found the changes inconvenient, the girls thought of them as a way of spicing up their play and making it even more fun.The three wraiths responded to Illuna’s question by twirling around in the air. They were completely on board.With that decided, the sisters joined the group and began to lead their friends around the castle. However, it didn’t take long for them to forget their original objective. The youngest of the bunch soon began to smile.The moment Illuna noticed the change in Lowe’s expression was the moment she acted. The wraith spun around behind Enne and put her prank into action by sticking both her face and her hands through the sword girl’s body. She looked up at the girl with an expression that effectively screamed “Boo!”There was a pair of reactions, a scream and a monotone wow. The scream had come from Illuna, who, despite knowing something would happen, was caught off guard nonetheless. The wow had come from Enne, who found the disembodied head coming out of her stomach more interesting than freaky.Although the prank hadn’t shocked its intended target, Lowe didn’t seem to mind. She simply shot all the way through Enne’s body before soaring down one of the castle’s long corridors. Her face was decorated with a happy smile. She was definitely having fun.Why, one might ask, did the wraith run away? The answer to that question was simple: because she knew she would be chased.“Geez, that startled me!” Illuna shouted as she started running after Lowe and her sisters, who, for some odd reason, had retreated alongside their youngest sibling. “Wait! Come back!”The wraiths’ bodies were phantom-like. They couldn’t actually be caught even if they were chased down, but none of the parties involved cared. All that mattered to them was that it was fun nonetheless.“We should chase them too, Enne!” Shii, who had yet to run off, spoke to the girl who had silently watched the events unfold and extended her an invitation to the game of tag.
“How..?” Enne tilted her head.
“All you have to do is run after them! It’ll be really fun!”
“Okay.”The pair pumped their legs and began to chase the other four girls deep into the castle. And in doing so, they completely forgot about showing Enne around, their original objective, and instead engaged in an all-out game of tag.<– Prev — Next –>

A Day In the Life of Another Little Girl
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Alright girls, it’s time for lunch!” Enne stepped out of the tall patch of grass she had been hiding in as she heard a familiar voice call out to her. “Hey Enne. Where’s everyone else?”One of the doors that had been standing around in the courtyard all by itself had opened. Enne expected to, naturally, see more courtyard on the other side. But instead, the mysterious door displayed the room that everyone lived in. Out from it stepped a man who shared Enne’s hair colour, the master she adored with all her heart, the person whose side she wanted to remain by forever.“We’re playing hide and seek,” she said.
“I guess that explains why everyone’s missing,” he said. “How far were you guys allowed to go? Just the courtyard?”
“Mhm.”Though the sword’s master had referred to it as one would a smaller area, the courtyard was by no means tiny. He had put a lot of work into it and it even seemed like it might be a little too big for the purposes of hide and seek. But because the girls were practically bursting with energy, they didn’t find it to be a problem.The rules of this particular game session were constructed to be as fair as possible. The wraith girls had possessed the dolls that Enne’s master had given them so that they wouldn’t be able to hide in trees or walls. And the reason they had chosen the courtyard in particular was because Enne was unable to get more than a hundred meters away from her true form, which had been placed on a nearby bench in order to maximize her range of motion. Enne herself hadn’t really minded, but the other kids had fussed over her needs and adjusted the location to cater to them.“That sure sounds fun,” said her master with a smile.Warmth filled Enne’s chest the moment she saw it.“So whaddya say? Think you can be friends with everyone?” he asked.
“Mhm.” Enne nodded. “Everyone is really nice.”Enne was quiet. She still wasn’t all that great of a talker. And yet, all the other girls had immediately accepted her and included her in their activities. She was a bit embarrassed by the way the others were fussing over her, but she was happy nonetheless.“That’s good to hear,” said her master.He seemed happy that she was getting along with the others, as he promptly began to pat her on the head with his big, warm, rugged hands. So comfortable was the sensation that, without realizing it, Enne had extended her own hands and placed them on top of his. She had even tried to hold his hand against her head to ensure that he would keep rubbing it.But then she realized what she was doing. She immediately began to panic and question her own actions as she let go. She was confused. At a loss. Bewildered. She just didn’t know what to do. She thought that her actions might have been disrespectful and that they might have made her master unhappy. Enne was still unused to this new form of hers. She didn’t know how she was supposed to best express her affection.Yuki, however, didn’t mind. In fact, he almost seemed to find the relatively expressionless girl’s panic entertaining, as he chuckled before continuing to affectionately stroke her hair. The smile on his face led Enne to judge that he hadn’t been annoyed by her actions. Realizing this, she recovered from her state of agitation and lowered the arms that she had been waving around while at a loss. She simply went meek and continued to allow herself to be pet in much the same manner as a housecat.She knew that her face had turned red, but she continued to silently enjoy the sensation of her master’s touch, which could only be described as anything but unpleasant. Before long, she heard a voice coming from behind her.“There you are Enne! I finally found you!” declared Illuna triumphantly. “Oh, hi Yuki!”She was accompanied by Shii and all three of the wraith-possessed dolls, which meant that Enne had been the last of the group to be found. All three wraiths happily floated towards their master and encircled him the moment they saw him.“You girls sure are full of energy,” he laughed.He then took his hand off of Enne’s head in order to play with the three hovering around him.“Oh…” A sad sound leaked from the sword’s mouth. She hadn’t realized that she was going to make it, so she hadn’t managed to stop herself in time. Enne raised her hands and used them to cover her mouth immediately, but it was too late. The sudden noise had already caused her master and the three wraiths hovering around him to suddenly turn to face her.Rei, Rui, and Lowe looked at each other and nodded in tacit understanding. They then suddenly floated behind Enne and started to use the dolls they were possessing in order to push her towards her master.She tried to say something, but the only noises that came out of her mouth were incoherent panicked stammers.Her master grinned as he watched her approach against her will. Once she was close enough, he wrapped an arm around her thighs and lifted her up.“Master…”Only after a bunch of panicking did she finally manage to stammer out a word, but he seemed to ignore it.“Alright kids, it’s time for lunch. You can play all you want after you’re done,” he said. “Rei, Rui, Lowe, you three might as well come with us. I know you can’t eat and all that, but I’m sure you’ll have more fun hanging around us while we do, right?”All three dolls nodded in agreement. Likewise, Illuna and Shii happily vocalized their intention to engage in their midday meal.With her girl form still in his arms, Yuki grabbed Enne’s real body with his other hand and headed towards the door leading to the true throne room.“Good for you Enne!” Illuna, who was walking right by her master’s side, looked up at Enne, giggled, and flashed a big smile.
“Mhm…”The sword girl didn’t exactly understand why, but she felt as if being seen as she was now was extremely embarrassing, so she nodded in order to respond to Illuna’s words before burying her face into her master’s shoulder.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Another couple chapters down, and I had to schedule a dentist appointment because they were so sweet, I got a cavity. So thanks a bunch, JM. You’ve officially messed with my health. Oh well, Lefi probably will have it worse. Just imagine, the Supreme Dragon getting a cavity and having to have it taken care of. That would be a hilarious side story, in my own opinion. Also, Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers is only a day or two away, so I’m really excited for that. I’ll be leveling up SAM mainly, since it fits with the story I’m building for my character. Been a BLM all through ARR, HW, and SB, but after the final fight of SB, realizes she needs more power, so turns to SAM for that power. Might get Dark Knight to level 70 as well, just for that bit of extra flavor. Thanks to Tonatsi for the question, even if it annoyed the heck out of me… See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

The Dragonlord
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixMajor events are often abrupt in nature. They occur without much in the way of warning and sweep you right off your feet with a series of unexpected occurrences. And there was no better testament to their sudden nature than today. Lefi and I had been in the middle of lazing around as usual when she suddenly stood up and looked towards the door leading outside.“What’s wrong, Le—” I cut myself off in the middle of asking her the question as my map popped open.There was an intruder. One powerful enough to prompt my map to open. Looking into the details, I immediately discovered that our uninvited guest was of the winged variety. It flew over the forest and headed in our general direction.“The hell is this thing!?” I asked while narrowing my eyes.
“I believe it to be an acquaintance of mine,” muttered Lefi as she still stood facing the door.Looking at her, I realized that her eyes had also been narrowed, and they were giving off the same sharp glint as mine. It was a glare, not the type one would typically direct towards an acquaintance. Welp… I guess that means it’s someone she doesn’t like.“I shall return shortly, for it is likely I who his business concerns.” Lefi began moving towards the door, but I placed a hand on her shoulder and stopped her.
“Hold on. I’m coming too.”
“It would be best to refrain,” said Lefi. “The fool at our doorstep is one that believes himself far superior to all. I know that not even my presence will suffice in restraining his aggressive impulses. It is dangerous for you to accompany me.”
“All I’m hearing is that I should really be coming with you,” I said. “I’m not about to make you face off against someone like that all by yourself.”The look on Lefi’s face indicated that the individual in question was likely the type she didn’t enjoy dealing with. It was true that she was far stronger than me and more than capable of handling the situation even if something was to happen, but that didn’t change anything. The dungeon was mine. Protecting it from intruders like her obviously not-so-nice acquaintance was my job. I wasn’t able to just kick back and laze around with my legs up while she handled everything for me.“You do not need to concern yourself with my well being. I am the Supreme Dragon. No harm shall come to me.”
“Doesn’t matter. I’m still coming.”She tried to dissuade me, but I wasn’t going to back down. As a man, I just… couldn’t. I couldn’t turn a blind eye on Lefi walking into a potentially dangerous situation on her own, even if she was so powerful that she was capable of overwhelming every other being in this world with ease. I knew that there was a chance that I would just be in the way, but there was also a chance I wouldn’t.Our eyes met. She stared into my eyes, but I didn’t yield.“I suppose there is no stopping you,” she chuckled. “Very well, Yuki, I shall entrust you with my well being.”
“Then consider yourself safe, partner.”Lefi responded to my confident reply with a small smile.***I gathered up the dungeon’s residents and told them not to leave the true throne room under any circumstances whatsoever until Lefi and I returned. I then had Enne dispel her human form before grabbing her by the hilt and hoisting her blade over my shoulder. I didn’t even bother sheathing her before stepping outside the cave. The blade almost seemed a bit nervous, likely because she could sense that I was a lot less relaxed than usual. She wasn’t the only weapon I had equipped. I had my gun and a dagger holstered on my hips, and a pouch with several potions in it strapped to one of my thighs.It was my newly devised fully equipped state. The potion pouch was a result of iteration. My battle with that one sadistic douche had led me to understand that it was best to have a few on me just in case I didn’t have enough time to reach into my inventory and retrieve them.Once outside, Lefi and I stood side by side as we regarded the winged intruder, the dragon, flying through the air. It seemed to notice us, as it swooped down towards us the moment we left the cave. It stopped and began hovering around in midair right as it reached us.Though it technically belonged to the same species as her, its form was nothing like Lefi’s. The dragon before us was larger, had black scales, and all in all, seemed a lot more rugged and bony.***
General Information
Name: Gilordio Gyogarr
Race: Black Dragon
Class: Dragonlord
Level: 402Titles
Usurper
King of the Dragons
***The winged lizard had one hell of a sense of presence. It exerted so much pressure that even being near it caused cold sweat to run down my cheeks. His level was less than half of Lefi’s, but it was still much greater than my own, which meant that I was likely only able to see as much of his stat page as I was because he had it on display.My magic eye informed me that the dragon was chock full of mana. He probably had enough fuel to fight at full power for three straight days. And that was assuming that he’d be slinging spells the whole way through.“I have finally found you, Leficios. But I do not understand your bizarre whims,” said the black dragon with a scornful laugh. “Why have you, the Supreme Dragon, adjusted your form to mimic that of a mere human?”There was a disapproving glare in the dragon’s eye. The way he seemed to be looking down on everything around him, us included, pissed me off to no end. His expression had, admittedly, unsettled me a bit at first, but the emotion vanished as quickly as it’d come. Eugh. Yeah uh, I don’t think me and him are ever going to get along.“State your business, Gyogarr, and be quick with it. I have little time to waste on a whelp like you,” said Lefi with a scowl. Her tone was much sharper than usual.
“A ridiculous label. No other would dare name me a mere whelp.”
“Why is it that you have become the Dragonlord? What has happened to Bellum?”It seemed like Lefi had also looked at the black dragon’s stat page. Yeah uh, based on that usurper title? He probably stole it.“I have slain the senile old bastard and taken his title for myself! Now I am Dragonlord, and all those that reside in our village have fallen under my rule!” he declared.
“You slew Bellum?” Lefi’s face twisted in confusion.Hmmm… I guess that must mean that the Bellum guy was the last Dragonlord? And wait, did he just say that there’s a literal village full of dragons? Lefi’s making it seem like this guy killing the Bellum guy seems pretty unlikely, so I guess something weird must’ve happened in that draconic village or whatever.“I have! Though you have never regarded me as more than a whelp, I am now the king that presides over our people!”
“Ridiculous,” snorted Lefi. “What of the other ancient dragons? They are not so foolish as to obey you.”
“They were but foolish, senile old men, lacking in the ambition that a dragon should bear! And as such, I have driven them from our lands. Soon, my subordinates and I shall take to conquering this world as our own! And that, that is why I have appeared before you, Leficios, to extend you an invitation.”
“What…?”Lefi, who was dumbstruck by disbelief, could only manage a single word, but the black dragon didn’t seem to notice, as he continued passionately professing his intentions.“Leficios, Supreme Dragon. Join me. Join me as my mate and rule this world by my side! For with our powers combined, all that exist shall grovel at our feet!”
“Shut the fuck up, asshole.” I had remained silent and just listened at first, but I couldn’t keep my mouth shut any longer.
“What was that, insect?” The black dragon focused his gaze on me for the first time since his arrival.
“I told you to shut the fuck up.” I growled. “All you’ve been doing is blabbing on and on about how your head is filled with nothing but shit. You’re pretentious. You’ve got your head so far up your own ass you’ve basically turned yourself inside out. What are you, some kind of narcissistic freak? Do you suck your own dick for breakfast every morning?”The dragon didn’t quite seem used to being insulted, as my words had caused its eye to twitch in anger.“I couldn’t give half a fuck about the world at large. You can take it over, fuck it up, whatever. I don’t care. But if you want to do it, then do it yourself. Don’t be going around trying to get others involved just ‘cause your dick’s too tiny to do the job. What are you, some kind of spoiled brat? Didn’t mommy ever teach you not to bother other people?”
“You dare mock me, insect!?”The black dragon bore its fangs at me and snarled, but I sneered right back.“Well, considering that I’m just teaching some dumb fucking kid a bit of common sense, I’d say it’s more like I’m schooling you. I mean, just look at you. Your body’s huge, but on the inside, you’re just a baby. It’s pathetic, so pathetic it’s making me laugh.”
“It is as he says,” agreed Lefi. “Leave us, whelp. I have little interest in assuming control of this world, and even less in becoming your mate. I suggest that you return to the village and pursue another. I have no doubt that there are many available.”
“I see…” the dragon muttered. “So this insect is the reason for which you have assumed the form of a lowly human.”
“Indeed, for he is the partner I have chosen.”
“I see…”A sudden sense of crisis assaulted me and filled every fibre of my being.“Oh shit!”I only caught the slightest glimpse of the attack. My vision was filled with naught but black scales the moment I realized what he was up to. I managed to defend, but only because I was lucky. Obeying my instincts had caused me to bring Zaien up to block the blow, but the shockwave was so heavy that I was sent flying through the air regardless. There was so much force behind the attack that I almost thought I’d been hit by an F1 racecar going at its top speed.My field of view rapidly changed as I was carried by the momentum. Only after flying a few dozen meters did I finally process the fact that I was in midair. I materialized my wings, hit the brakes, and stopped.Pain coursed through the arm I was using to hold Zaien.“Oh? I had expected that to end you,” said the black dragon in a scornful tone. His arm was raised in a position that indicated he had just swung it.
“Yuki!” shouted Lefi before turning back towards the dragon. “You bastard!”
“Hmph.” The asshole snorted. “Your reactions are far too slow, Leficios. It is as I have thought. Imitating the form of a human has led to a drastic drop in your power. Not even the legendary Supreme Dragon means much in such a state, I see.”
“Is that a challenge, whelp? Very well. If you so badly wish for it, then I shall immediately deprive you of life and reduce you to cinde—”
“Stop it, Lefi.”Lefi snarled as she readied herself to rise to the black dragon’s challenge, but I stepped in and put an end to it.Hearing my voice led her to turn back to face me. “Are you unharmed, Yuki!?”
“Yeah, an attack like that’s no big deal,” I said. “Anyway, listen. You’re not taking him down. I am. Just sit there and watch while I kick his ass.”I raised my blade and pointed it towards the black dragon. “You all good, Enne?”
“Yes, Master,” replied my trusty sword. “I’m more worried about you.”
“Nah, I’m fine. I’m your master, after all. Taking this asshole down is going to be a piece of cake.”There was no other answer I could give. Even the girl that I thought of as my daughter was ready to fight. I wasn’t about to back down now. As her father, I always had to make it seem like I was fine so long as she was. Even if I ended up injured to the point where I was missing a limb or two.“Hah!” The dragon laughed. “You dare to face me!? Did you perhaps assume that blocking a single attack was enough to qualify you as a worthy opponent!? Do not get ahead of yourself, insect!”
“Shut the fuck up. I wasn’t talking to you, half-dick.”
“How dare you! Do not think that you shall escape after invoking my wrath!”I ignored the retard and continued talking to Lefi.“Just sit down and watch or something. Come on, we’ve been over this, haven’t we? I’m going to protect you.”
“I suppose we have,” giggled the silver-haired maiden. “Then I shall trust that you will be doing a good job of it. I trust that you will not lose, Yuki, not to the likes of him.”Lefi walked to the edge of the cliff and sat down. She crossed both of her arms and legs in order to declare that she had no intention of interfering.Thanks, Lefi. Seriously. You’re one hell of a woman.I grin before finally turning towards the piece of shit I had left fuming. There was an obvious difference between us. His level was well over five times my own, and his first attack had proven that the numbers weren’t just for show. I probably had a one percent chance of winning at best.But that didn’t matter. I didn’t, couldn’t, give a fuck.Because he had proposed to Lefi. Right in front of me.That was why I wouldn’t back down.That was why I had to fight him.And that was why I had to win. No matter what.Right then and there, he had declared himself indisputably hostile.“Come at me with everything you got, asshole. I’ll show you just how strong I can be.”
“Prattle on, insect. Let us see how long that impudent mouth of yours shall last.”And that was how I engaged the king of the world’s most powerful race in a duel to the death.<– Prev — Next –>

Pride — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerI flew, jumped, rolled, and crawled around in order to evade the stupid dragon’s attacks. Each dodge was accompanied by the crumbling of earth and rending of stone. Destruction followed in the wake of the asshole’s attacks. Every single strike would alter the terrain in some way.There wasn’t even a moment to spare. The attacks followed one after another; I had no time to rest or room to breathe. His strikes were so fast that I couldn’t even afford to blink. But I could track them. The shitlord was not nearly as cunning as his usurper title implied. His actions were simple, straightforward, and easy to read. The muscle-brained retard didn’t even seem to know how to throw a feint. His lack of finesse was a result of his overinflated stats. He had likely always been so much stronger than everything he’d fought that he had never felt the need to do anything crafty.I was only managing to hold on because I was a demon lord and I had the specs to match my title. I know I’ve probably said this like a dozen times already, but god damn, my eyes are good at keeping track of things. It’s probably ‘cause of that Magic Eye skill. God damn, that thing is the only thing keeping me alive right now. It’s letting me just barely keep track of him. Er, actually, I’m willing to bet that his usurper title is playing a part in it too. It’s probably proccing my One Who Judges title and boosting all my stats.Despite everything I had going for me, I couldn’t afford to lose focus. The moment I stopped paying attention was the moment I would reincarnate into a bunch of scattered lumps of ground meat.“Where has that high and mighty attitude of yours gone now, insect?”Shit for brains sneered as he mocked me, so I put as much power as I could into my next dodge and managed to give myself just enough space to swing Zaien at his arm. The blade landed on its target, and though it was met with scale, it didn’t fail to leave its mark. Unlike Lefi’s scales, which were far too tough for Zaien, the stupid black dragon’s weren’t. The blade made her way through a thinner part of his natural armour and drew blood as she carved through his flesh.“Sorry, what was that?” I smirked. “I can’t hear you over the sound of your blood gushing out of this bug bite you’ve got here.”I suddenly felt a rush of magical energy from right underneath me. I tried to backstep in order to avoid the retard’s spell, but I wasn’t fast enough. The ground beneath me burst with an explosion and launched me through the air. A powerful shockwave coursed through my body and knocked all the air out of my lungs. I wasn’t able to right myself and didn’t stop until I hit a large rock.I spent a few moments taking deep breaths in order to replenish my supply of oxygen before forcing myself back to my feet. I raised my weapon, only to see the dragon’s fangs right before my eyes.There was little time to evade, but I managed to throw myself into a roll, then correct my posture and swing Zaien at the back of his neck. But this time, he was actually on guard. He immediately reared his head to avoid the blow before spinning around and striking with his tail.Despite being as thick as the trunk of an ancient tree, the lizard’s scaly appendage whistled through the air like a whip and cleaved right into the side of my body. It was a direct hit. I was sent flying yet again and skidded off the ground a few times before finally losing momentum.The scenery faded in and out over and over as my body throbbed with an intense, dull pain. I had to concentrate to keep myself conscious. I knew I would pass out the moment I lost focus.“Behold, Leficios,” said the autistic lizard. “This insect buzzes about, but he has not the power to back his irksome claims. Only I am worthy of your companionship.”Lefi didn’t bother responding to the shitlord. She simply continued staring right at me with arms folded. She didn’t step forward or shout my name. All she did was continue to sit where she was with her arms and legs folded. And in doing so, she demonstrated that she trusted me, that she believed that I would be able to figure something out.“Shut… the fuck up… you oversized lizard.” I was only barely able to squeeze out my words between deep breaths. “You think… that a brain-damaged narcissist… like you suits her? Just how fucking… stuck up… can you be…?”I had already used up all the potions I had stored in my thigh pouch, so I grabbed another out of my inventory and downed it.The only reason I was still alive was because the autofellating freak kept allowing me to recover. It seemed he wanted to keep kicking me around in order to show Lefi my bad side and make an appeal with his strength. It was clear that he thought absolutely nothing of me. He didn’t see me as a threat, but rather a tool he could use to earn Lefi’s favour. Hah. Give it up, Moron. That ain’t going to get you nowhere. Lefi knows me. She knows every side of me. We spend the better part of every single day together. Do you seriously think something like this would make either of us flinch? Unlike you, we don’t spend our lives acting all self-righteous and pretending we’re more than who we really are.“Your words mean little if you speak them whilst grovelling about,” said the dragon. “Truly, your behaviour is appropriate for that of an insect.”
“Oh, shut… up already…” I rolled my eyes as I continued to groan. “And for your… information… there are some…strong ass bugs… out there…”Especially ants and bees. Those two are definitely some of this forest’s stronger monsters.I used both arms to push myself off the ground before readying Zaien in order to confront shit for brains yet again. This time, however, it seemed he wasn’t going to be as patient as usual. I sensed an attack the moment I began getting to my feet.There was no point raising my head just to take a look at the incoming strike. I didn’t bother. I simply dove forward and heard a loud roar as a jet black spear passed through the space my body had occupied only moments earlier. It was the dragon’s magic.Though I had managed to dodge his first strike, I knew that it wasn’t yet over. Crisis detection’s alarm system was still blaring as loudly as it could. And then, a moment later, I found myself surrounded. Countless black spears had spawned around me. There was no escape. They covered literally every angle.The moment my mind registered them was the moment they began moving. Each and every single one began flying straight at me.I clicked my tongue as I rolled, twisted, and swung Zaien in order to avoid and parry the attacks. But there were too many. I couldn’t avoid all of them. Several dozen scraped past me and dug away at my flesh. Some hit their marks and found themselves in one end of my body and out the other.A bloody cough escaped my throat. I had managed to avoid fatal damage, but my desperate defence was still far from a success. One of my legs had been struck in a really bad place. All the strength suddenly drained from it and caused me to fall to my knees.Shit-for-brains’ tail closed in on me. I had taken too much damage; I couldn’t dodge it. My only choice was to raise Zaien and take the attack head-on. And so, I was once again sent tumbling through the air.So heavy was the blow that it momentarily deprived me of my consciousness. Upon regaining it, I found myself with my back on the ground with my eyes turned up towards the sky. I realized that I had stopped breathing, so I took a deep breath and forced my lungs to take as much air as they could while my heart desperately pumped oxygen into my bloodstream.Regaining consciousness meant regaining my sense of pain. There wasn’t a single part of me that didn’t hurt. My body burned. It burned so badly that I wanted to scream like a child as I writhed about on the ground. But I didn’t. I endured it with sheer willpower as I used my shaking hands to wrench the dragon’s spears out of my body. I couldn’t be bothered to drink another potion, so I crushed the one I grabbed out of my inventory and allowed the liquid to flow all over me instead.“You truly are an insect. I do not see how any other sort of creature would continue to struggle after sustaining so many wounds.” Fuckface sneered at me in a manner that showed just how lightly he was taking me.It was annoying. And so, I responded.With a laugh.It was a deep, hearty laugh, one that seemed to make it appear as if I was enjoying the situation at hand. And as I cackled, I rose to my feet in a manner reminiscent of some sort of revenant.Because I was finally ready to take him down. My preparations were finally complete.“So you have finally lost your mind, I see?” Half-dick looked at me with a face full of disdain. “So miserable you are that I no longer have any words to describe you.”
“Hey, douchebag.” My face warped into a huge, distorted grin as I spoke. “You might want to watch your feet.”I raised a finger towards the floating menu panel that I had kept open this whole time and pressed a certain button.The moment I did was the moment the ground beneath the dragon vanished. Gravity pulled him downwards the moment he lost his footing; he fell right into the pit that had been dug underneath him. Inside the pit lay a countless number of sharpened stakes. Each was angled upwards, and each had its tip coated in a deadly poison.“What!?” The asshole shouted in confusion before flapping his wings and taking to the sky in an attempt to escape. Hook, line, and sinker, motherfucker. What, you think I’m too blind to see your wings? Too bad, dipshit. I’ve got you read like a book.The sorry excuse for an intelligent lizard came into contact with a series of airborne traps the moment it tried to rise, traps I had spent extra DP on, just for him. They activated one after another and caused a series of explosions. In fact, so many of them had been triggered that the sky was filled with flame and smoke.Only after the explosions died down did the smoke finally clear. And there, the dragon was, entirely covered from head to toe in soot and blood. Whew. I’m glad that worked. I probably would’ve wanted to cry if all that proved ineffective.“How dare you!” roared Half-dick. “How dare you employ tricks so cowardly in nature!”
“Heh…” I chuckled before twisting my face into a smirk. “I blew most of my DP just to beat your ass. So do me a favour and enjoy the rest of the ride, alright?”I had converted most of the stuff I got from Lefi’s home to DP and even went out to hunt monsters on a regular basis. I had done all of it in order to earn myself a pretty penny so I could summon all four of my new subordinates at once. But now, most of my cash had gone out the window. The reason? I had filled the entire area with traps whilst tanking the retarded dragon’s attacks. Alright y’little braggart, time for me to learn you a few lessons on why the Geneva Conventions regulate landmines.The area we were fighting in had basically turned into a giant deathtrap capable of instantly eradicating anything that wasn’t on the tier of a dragon. And that had been my goal this whole time.I was facing something much stronger than me. I would have to be no different from the heroes of which legends were sung if I wished to win in a head-on confrontation. And while I was indeed the type of character that would show up in legends, I was no hero.At the end of the day, I was just another ordinary guy. Or rather, an ordinary demon lord. I couldn’t possibly win against something so much more powerful than me without resorting to what others would label unfair. But that was fine. Because it was my dungeon, my world. As long as we fought within my territory, the rules were mine to make. If I wanted to win, then I would have to make use of that power and abuse my right as dungeon master to the fullest extent possible. I’m counting on you, dungeon old pal. I can’t lose here. Lend me every last bit of your power so I can pull all the underhanded bullshit I can possibly think of.Fuckface didn’t quite seem to enjoy taking a hit from someone he looked down on. His face contorted in rage, so I flashed him a provocative grin.“Come at me, bro. It’s time for round two.”<– Prev — Next –>

Pride — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Do not get ahead of yourself, mongrel,” said the dragon. “For your petty tricks shall not defeat me!”The strength of the explosions I had hammered him with had left him bloodied, but they hadn’t finished him off, so he assumed that my attacks were unable to prove fatal. As such, he decided to ignore my traps. He flapped his wings and dove straight at me. He was moving much faster than he was before; he shot through the air like a bullet. His newfound speed was obviously a result of his rage.Though he was fast, speed was all he had going for him.“Oh yeah,” I smirked. “You might want to be careful of invisible walls.” There was a splat the moment after I issued the warning. The dragon ran face first into a solid wall made up of air around us. He kept flapping his wings as he thoughtlessly rushed through it, but the shock had rattled his brain and caused him to veer off course.Technically speaking, I hadn’t hit him with a trap. Rather, I had used a feature the dungeon called “Hardening.” Hardening was normally something that was meant to be used on walls, floors, and ceilings of boss rooms. Its intended purpose was to harden their surfaces and allow the boss to go all out without subsequently destroying the dungeon. But it could be used for much more than just that.Hardening was capable of functioning on a wide variety of targets. It could work on both air and water so long as I specified the area it was meant to target. I had discovered this aspect of hardening while messing around in an attempt to make the girls an aquarium. I had hardened a block of water in hopes of circumventing the need for an actual glass display case. Touching it, I confirmed that the whole thing was tough as a chunk of concrete, which unfortunately also led to the conclusion that it couldn’t be used for its intended purpose. Fish weren’t exactly capable of swimming in concrete, after all. Not that they could even get inside of the damned thing to begin with.Long story short, the skill was flexible and could be used for more than just its intended purpose. And that was exactly what I did. I used it to create an invisible wall in midair, right between Fuckface and I. The odd application of the ability made it cost much more DP than usual, so I hadn’t bothered making more than just one. It was the kind of trick I only expected the dragon to fall for once.“Curse you!”The dragon began screaming at me as soon as he recovered from his confusion. He then began channelling an incredible amount of magical energy with all of it centred in his mouth. It seemed like he intended on unleashing the spell that Lefi had shown me the other day, the strongest spell a dragon could use. Its roar.I knew that his wouldn’t be nearly as powerful as Lefi’s, but I still didn’t want to let it hit me. I would probably die if it landed, even if it only grazed me. With that piece of knowledge in mind, I promptly initiated evasive action, but he kept his mouth trained on me with all the accuracy of a seasoned marksman. He continued tracing me until suddenly, the magical power contained within his mouth detonated.There was a series of explosions—not a single one of which was orchestrated by the brainless excuse of a dragon. Heat was expelled into his surroundings in the form of fire and air. The aftermath had travelled so far that even I had been affected.He had once again fallen into a trap, a rare magic-based mage killer that used any and all nearby mana as fuel for its blast. It worked like a grenade chucked at a gas station. The explosion triggered by the dungeon’s defensive mechanism had caused a chain reaction that led to his own magical powers being used against him. The explosion wouldn’t have been anywhere near as big had he not tried to channel his roar.And that was why I had made him shift his aim. The goal I had in mind had been to get his mouth close enough to the trap to pop it. And the gullible idiot fell for it.Getting smacked around by the manchild had taught me something important: he wasn’t actually well versed in the art of battle. He was able to act incredibly quickly. His attack power was through the roof and he could cast spells so quickly he made the entire process seem trivial. But that was it. He was a bundle of raw stats, but that was all he was. His attacks were simple, and he had all the spatial awareness of a headless chicken.Long story short, he was a terrible fighter. He was so lacking in skill that he wasn’t able to put down someone that was many, many times weaker than him. He was everything Lefi wasn’t. The Supreme Dragon had accompanied me on a hunt whilst in her dragon form on just a single occasion. And yet, the way she fought had burnt itself into my mind. The acts of violence were performed with such finesse that I couldn’t help but think of them as beautiful. She carried herself with such grace that I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. She had demonstrated that she was truly deserving of her title as the strongest member of this world’s most powerful race. Never would I forget the magnificence that was the Supreme Dragon, for it had etched itself into my soul.I knew that Lefi was an exception, a special entity that existed far outside the norm. But even so, I had expected more out of the Potatolord. He was a member of her race. He was supposed to be the king that presided over their people. And yet, compared to her, he was nothing. He may as well have been a vegetable. His title came off as exaggerated bullshit, a label slapped onto a weakling for the sake of irony. I would have been long dead had he even the slightest bit of martial skill. That was just how high his raw stats were. Only now did I truly understand why Lefi had seemed so confused when she learned of his title. He didn’t deserve to be the Dragonlord. He couldn’t have possibly earned the title of king through legitimate means. There had to have been some sort of external factor that had played into his ascension.The smoke caused by the explosions cleared as I contemplated my opponent’s abilities. And there, I saw him with his body covered in burns. His eyes had rolled back in their sockets; he was unconscious. I knew dragon was super effective against dragon. Using his own magic against him was a great idea. Alright, here’s my chance!I knew that I wouldn’t be able to inflict any significant damage if I just ran up and started trying to whack him, so I drained the rest of my DP in order to set a series of traps in his vicinity. But his eyes spun back around right as I started. Shitface had regained consciousness.He roared. He roared a bestial howl that no longer contained any semblance of meaning or intelligence.“What th—!?”And then, he lunged at me. He turned towards me and flew in a straight line without any regard for his surroundings. My traps pelted him with attack after attack, but he didn’t stop.I clicked my tongue and leapt to the side to avoid his charge, but a magical energy signature appeared right where I landed. The earth in front of me burst in an explosion and launched me into the air.His claws closed in from above.It didn’t matter how hard I flapped my wings. I couldn’t escape. I had no choice but to allow him to smack me back into the ground.I coughed up even more blood as my body was assaulted by the impact. It hurt so bad I could see sparks. But I couldn’t afford to let my momentum carry me. I couldn’t afford to allow my pain to control me. Because, as I tumbled, I saw. I saw his fangs close in and threaten to tear me limb from limb.A lack of action would result in death.I manually activated a nearby trap, one that caused a giant iron pole to pop out of the ground. The impact threw him off course and allowed me to just narrowly avoid his jaws. They were so close that I could hear the gnashing of teeth as they closed literally right by my side. I rolled to get a bit further away from him so he couldn’t follow with another bite, only to sense even more magic.I clicked my tongue and immediately dragged my unresponsive, battered body into the air by flapping my wings with all the power I could muster. A moment later, the place where I stood was pierced by dozens of pitch-black spears.The shitlord’s actions were even faster than they had been before. It was almost like he had used his anger as a battery, like he had clocked himself up in order to operate at a higher voltage. He had shifted gears. At the battle’s onset, he had been a cat, and I a mouse. But now, he was a tiger, a tiger using all of its might to hunt its prey. Damn it. I wish I took him out while he still had his guard down. Honestly, though, I kinda figured things wouldn’t all go according to plan.He turned towards me and once again tried to close in. This time, he spouted fire from his mouth as he gave chase. What the fuck!? Is this asshole supposed to be some sort of titan? Like Godzilla or something!?I dodged the flames by using my wings to move myself through the air. The fireballs weren’t as deadly as a roar, but they were still dangerous in their own right. Each projectile was superheated by an incredible amount of magical energy, and the rate at which he could fire them was outlandish. He didn’t care that I was dodging them. He continued to shoot a veritable bullet hell’s worth of fireballs right at me. Shit. I gotta do something. He’s either going to burn me or catch up if I don’t figure something out.He continued to pop trap after trap as he chased me, but the retarded dragon didn’t care. Some of them hit him hard enough to momentarily stop him in his tracks, but he would also resume charging at me the moment he regained control.I was fast.But even though I was slowing him down, he was faster. Though he looked like nothing but a bony winged lizard, he was still a member of the race that ruled the sky. There was no way I could match him in his own realm. He was slowly but surely closing in.Without any further delay, I took a sudden turn in order to combat my disadvantage. I started to go straight up and ascended with all the vigour of a zealot attempting to reach the heavens. Shit for brains naturally followed without considering the consequences, only to scrunch up his face as his eyes were greeted with the sight of the sun.Fuck yes! Dragon or not, looks like staring into the sun hurts your eyes, don’t it? Too bad you aren’t any brighter than your scales, huh?I spun around the moment he flinched and began diving straight at him.“Die!”He desperately tried to launch a fireball at me, but I avoided the late reaction with a flap of my wings. I raised my arms, swung Zaien, and shouted as we crossed paths.I landed a heavy blow. I could feel the impact run up my arms as I delivered a cut that ran all the way from the tip of his jaw up through one of his eyes. Blood flew everywhere as he roared in pain and agony. I kicked the bastard to give myself enough momentum to wrench Zaien out of his flesh and immediately tried to open up just enough distance to avoid a counter.Though I knew of his inexperience, I failed to account for it. He flailed. He literally flailed around randomly in pain. And as a result, his tail slammed into my side in the middle of my retreat. I hadn’t braced myself for the unexpected attack, so I was sent flying into a tailspin. I tried my best to regain control of my body, but I couldn’t.The pathetic excuse for a dragon noticed my dilemma and immediately dove after me. His jaw drew closer. I couldn’t correct my posture. I couldn’t dodge.He got me.His jaws closed on the left side of my body and took off both my left wings as well as my left arm.I groaned in anguish as blood gushed from my wounds.Though I needed to balance myself, I couldn’t. I was rendered incapable by the fact that I was missing half my wings, so I fell from the sky and smashed into the earth below.And for a moment, I seemed to black out.My mind went hazy. The scene I saw, the sky above, almost seemed blurry. Like I couldn’t quite make it out.“Master! Master!!” But Enne called for me. Her voice was desperate, dyed in panic. And because it was so different, it allowed me to focus. I used it as an anchor to get a grip on my consciousness and keep it from fading.“Thank goodness,” said Enne with a sigh of relief. “You’re still alive, Master.”I craned my neck downwards and gazed upon my body. My left shoulder and everything attached to it was gone. And although my right arm was still present, it refused to move. It was almost like it wasn’t mine anymore. It wouldn’t listen to me no matter how hard I willed it to act.Both of my left wings had vanished. The midair encounter had torn them from my body. Like my right arm, my right wings were broken. I couldn’t get them to function. And that was just the start of it. My whole body was fucked. There wasn’t a single part of me that was unharmed. I had endured so much damage that I couldn’t even feel the pain anymore. The only good news I had was that both my legs were still functional.I was as ragged as an old dishcloth. My body was so riddled with holes that I might as well have been dead.But I wasn’t.I was still alive.I could still fight.“Don’t move, Master! You can’t! You’ll die!”Enne desperately tried to stop me, but I laughed off her concern.“Sorry Enne. But I can’t stop now.”I turned my glance towards my sworn foe, only to see a sight that put a grin on my face. He was hurt. The sorry excuse of a man was rolling around on the ground, roaring over and over as the wound, which almost seemed negligible compared to my own, inflicted waves of supposedly unbearable agony upon him.Pathetic as he was, the man that had declared himself my enemy was still alive and well.And so was I.The duel had yet to end.I was a demon lord. I could take plenty of punishment. Though I had suffered many an injury, none were so debilitating that I was rendered incapable of continuing. And knowing that both my enemy and I still drew breath was all I needed to push myself to fight.Through force of will, I wriggled over to Zaien in a manner reminiscent of a caterpillar and used my mouth to grab her by the handle, the handle that had been smothered in crimson, dirtied by my blood. I poured my remaining strength into my shivering legs and got to my knees.And then, I stood right back up and began to advance.<– Prev — Next –>

Pride — Part 3
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixRoar after roar rang through the Wicked Forest as the black dragon known as Gilordio Gyogarr writhed about on the ground. The cut that ran along his face burned with fiery agony while the eye that had been crushed by his foe ached with a powerful throbbing pain. It almost felt as if it something was eating at the damaged socket.To him, pain was an unfamiliar sensation, one that he had almost never known. Nothing he fought had ever inflicted upon him anything beyond a minor wound. Every single creature he faced was so far below him that he considered them mere insects he had to squish. And thus, the pain he now had to bear was the most severe he had ever experienced.“Hmph.” The Supreme Dragon snorted scornfully. “An unsightly display. I am shocked to think that you would call yourself a man.”Gyogarr turned his remaining eye up towards her and gave her a death stare. And as he did, he learned that she was looking at him as she would a piece of garbage. Her eyes were cold as ice, and the smile on her face almost seemed to exist only to declare that she wished to insult him.“The pain that Yuki felt was much more severe than your own. You dared to insult him as he endured it and continued to fight. And now you have proven that you are much less a man than he,” she mocked. “A tiny wound has caused you to squawk and chirp like a fledgling. You are pathetic. I cannot believe that one so miserable would be crowned Dragonlord.”
“Speak of him no longer, Leficios, for I have already ended his life! I have crushed the insect that you held so dear!”Gyogarr had eaten one of the insect’s arms and two of his wings. And then, he had fallen. The black dragon had even gazed upon him with his remaining eye to ensure that he remained still. And he had indeed confirmed it. He was certain that the insect Leficios appeared so obsessed with had remained unmoving. It had met its demise.The Dragonlord’s original intent was to use fangs and tear him apart before swallowing him whole, but losing an eye had thrown off his ability to perceive depth. And thus, he had failed to perfectly replicate his intentions. Still, he knew that he had won. That much was fact.His certainty was what had driven Gyogarr to fearlessly provoke Leficios, to mock her with his death. And yet, she remained unfazed. Her scornful smile never wavered.“An interesting claim to make, whelp, for I see no evidence of Yuki’s defeat.”
“What…!?”The Supreme Dragon’s words caused Gyogarr to crane his neck around in alarm and gaze upon the insect that he had supposedly crushed. Doing so caused his face to warp in a mix of shock and disbelief.He didn’t understand how it was possible. He was sure that he had killed him.But even so, the insect had gotten back to his feet.He was injured. His body was so covered in wounds that he would sooner be identified as a corpse than a member of the living. But even so, he continued to march. He continued to move towards the Dragonlord, one step at a time with his sword brandished in his mouth.Every step he took, unstable as it was, was filled with purpose. He sought none other than Gyogarr’s life.The Dragonlord did not understand the sight before him. He was incapable. The insect’s wounds were fatal no matter how one looked upon them. It simply did not make sense for him to be able to move. Gyogarr would have understood if he had done as he had earlier and drank a potion in order to recover his stamina. But the fact that he was still covered in injuries evidenced that it was not the case.And yet, he somehow continued to step forward.To threaten to take Gyogarr’s life.“You are weak,” said the Supreme Dragon. “Attacks as pathetic as yours could never slay the partner that I have chosen.”Her words swirled around in his head. They almost seemed to echo within his mind. And as they did, they led him to a conclusion.The insect, the creature before him was abnormal. There had to be something wrong with him. The air about him was bizarre; it was almost as if he was giving off a domineering aura, one that threatened to devour the dragon whole. And the longer he watched the insect, the more at risk he felt of being consumed.As the dragon gazed upon the man, he too craned his head upwards to look at the dragon.Their eyes met.And then, half a heartbeat later, the man began to grin.A shiver ran up the black dragon’s spine.He didn’t know exactly when it had happened, but he soon realized that he had retreated. He had been intimidated to such an extent that he had taken a full step back away from the creature that sought to deprive him of his life.“T-take not another step! Do not come any closer!” The dragon couldn’t help but scream a frantic command as he swung his tail.The attack landed. It caused Gyogarr’s foe to skid along the ground, but it didn’t stop him.He got to his knees, and then to his feet, and once again began to march. It was like the attack had never landed to begin with.Again, a shiver ran up the black dragon’s spine.And then, he had an epiphany. He finally began to understand why the man refused to fall.He was immortal.The man was like a member of the undead, only more. He was a monster, a freak that would never fall no matter how much he was attacked.He was dangerous. Too dangerous. The black dragon realized that he would have to do something to slay the man immediately else run the risk of being hunted.His physical attacks were too weak. They were sure to do nothing to him. Not even his fangs had managed to end him. Gyogarr realized that he would have to completely erase the man in his entirety if he wished to truly kill him. He would have to ensure that no trace of him was left behind, that every scrap of his flesh was removed from this world.Which meant he would have to resort to his most powerful spell: his roar.The black dragon opened his mouth upon coming to the conclusion and took a deep breath as he began to channel his magical energies.Only to collapse where he stood.***“W-Wh…!?” Half-dick tried to speak, but he couldn’t so much as manage anything more than just a wheeze.
“Took…long enough…”That said, I wasn’t all that much better off. I had to exert myself to squeeze out my words. Still, I was content. I smirked as I watched the douchebag that had kicked my ass collapse. So heavy he was that the earth shook as he hit the ground.The mentally challenged lizard was confused. His eye darted about as he tried to figure out exactly what had happened. He even tried to speak, but his mouth wasn’t working right. He couldn’t voice his thoughts no matter how hard he tried.“I’m glad… my plan… worked out…” I muttered under my breath as I came to the conclusion that bearing with the pain he had inflicted upon me had ultimately been worthwhile.Numbskull had collapsed. And for a simple reason at that.I had set him up.Dragons were terrifying creatures. Their scales were so hard that normal weapons couldn’t even hope to scratch them. They were so fast that my eyes had trouble keeping up with their movements. Their bodies were capable of handling high altitudes with ease, they possessed incredible quantities of magical energy, and their spells had an excess of firepower. They were the predators that stood at this world’s apex. And that was the catch.Being predators meant that they too were living things. They had needs. And living with Lefi had taught me more than everything I needed to know about draconic biology. Like me, they had to eat. Like me, they had to sleep. Like me, they had to breathe.Their reliance on breathing meant that they were vulnerable to something that basically every other living creature was weak to: an odourless, colourless toxin known to the world at large as carbon monoxide.The dungeon was my realm. So long as we were within it, my word was law. And that was why I could freely alter any property that I was aware of. The air’s precise composition was no exception.I knew that this world wasn’t quite the same as my last. The air was filled with a mysterious substance known as the magic particle. But that aside, the air composition was more or less the same as that of the world I’d lived in prior to my reincarnation. Of course, I didn’t know if the exact percentages of the different gasses were anywhere near identical, but I did know that the very same gasses did at least exist. There was oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and basically everything else. The experiments that I had run whilst teaching the girls about combustion had demonstrated that their properties were no different from what they had been back on Earth.Even in my past life, carbon monoxide had been a fairly well-known poison, one that many were familiar with and guarded against.Mere exposure to a concentration of air that contained 0.15% carbon monoxide was enough to render one dizzy enough to collapse. Anything greater than 1% of the stuff was enough to knock someone out and kill them. It was a terrifying poison, one that was lethal to basically every sort of living thing. Although dragons were apex predators, I expected that they too would be affected.And my expectations proved correct.I had won my bet.The dragon seemed to have wished to finish me off with a roar or something. And as a result, he took an incredibly deep breath, thereby flooding his own lungs with a sudden influx of carbon monoxide. His body was unable to rid itself of the toxin, and so, he swooned. Man, I’ve been hella gambling lately. At this rate, I might as well start introducing myself as the Demon Lord of Gambling.Carbon monoxide had been my poison of choice because it was the most likely to fulfill its purpose. Fighting the retard had led me to realize that he had literally no skills that enhanced his ability to detect it. Thus, it was a much better option than a more traditional poison, as such a poison would likely come with a telling scent.The many explosive traps that I had set all over the place had only existed in order to bolster the deadly gas’ concentration through incomplete combustion. In other words, they were there to trick him, to cover up the fact that I was using the dungeon’s settings to manually alter the air composition.Of course, Lefi had seen through the trick immediately. She had even created a protective, wind-based barrier around herself. And so had I. Both of us had used primordial magic to ensure that we wouldn’t inhale the toxin. And yet, the piece of shit that I was up against somehow never noticed.He never realized that I was too busy keeping my barrier active to cast any magic. Hell, he hadn’t even seemed to find my lack of magic the slightest bit suspicious. Seriously man. You really gotta learn to pay more attention. I guess that’ll have to be what you work on while you hang around in hell. Work hard down there. If you’re lucky enough, you might actually get another chance at life. I know I did.With Zaien still held in my mouth, I slowly dragged my body over to where the dumb lizard had collapsed, step by step.Muffled screams leaked from his throat as I slowly inched my way towards him. His terror was reflected in his eye. Seeing it caused my lips to spread into a huge grin.“I kant… ell vat… you’re sain…”Though, you probably can’t tell what I’m saying either. Besides, it’s way too late for you to try talking things out now. This might’ve turned out differently if you tried using diplomacy from the start. Actually, naw, who am I kidding. You and I never could have gotten along. Oh well, don’t worry. I won’t be mounting your head on any walls for the sake of keeping trophies. I don’t want to use that gross ass body of yours to make myself new gear either. I’m just going to turn you into DP, into fertilizer I can use to strengthen my dungeon.So feel free to do me a favour and die.I finally reached him as I finished entertaining the idea of murdering him in cold blood.“Shee ya in hell, douchebwaag.”I swung Zaien with all the force I could muster. She had absorbed so much of his blood and grown so much more powerful that his scales could no longer defend him against her blade.Her edge easily sawed through his flesh.And split his head from his neck.<– Prev — Next –>

Lefi and Yuki
Editors: Sebas Tian, SpeedphoenixA gentle warmth enveloped both my head and my cheeks. It was soft, comfortable, and provided me with a sense of relief. The touch I felt on my cheeks moved up then down, and up, then down, like a tender caress.It felt so heavenly that I got the impression I was being rocked back and forth in some sort of cradle. I drifted back and forth between wake and sleep as I enjoyed the sensation. Though I felt so comfortable I didn’t want to wake, my consciousness slowly returned. As I opened my eyes, I found myself looking straight into Lefi’s.“Have you finally awoken?”
“Yeah… Morning, Lefi.”For a while, I just continued to stare. My brain had yet to fully kick itself back into gear. It was still sluggish and only just barely capable of processing information, but I tried to figure out the situation at hand nonetheless.“Wait… how’d this happen?”My head was on Lefi’s lap. The soft, gentle warmth that I felt on the back of my head was the sensation of touching her thighs. And the tender caress I had felt on my cheek had been one of her hands. Her thighs are so, so soft… Oh man, I just wanna bury my face in them. That’d be bliss.…Well, that’s a completely unreserved thought. Brain, please.“It is simple. I placed your head upon my lap,” said Lefi. “It is quite the exquisite pillow, isn’t it? I believe no other to be its equal.”
“Yeah. It feels hella good.”
“M-Must you be so blunt? Your honesty disrupts my composure,” she said with a blush.
“Actually, now that I think about it, I’d say your wings are actually better if we judge purely based on how high quality a pillow something is. But that said, I think your thighs have got better staying power. If I had the chance to pick one and stick to it forever, I’d definitely take your thighs. Honestly, I’d probably even say that they’re both the best. Neither is really objectively better than the other. They’ve got different merits.”
“I did not think that you would still bear so much energy immediately following the events that have just transpired…” said Lefi with an exasperated smile.At first, I raised an eyebrow as I wondered what she meant, but soon realized that there was in fact more to the world than just Lefi. Only then did my mind finally process everything in the world around us.Above me lay the great blue sky. Around me, there lay countless craters and scorch marks. Parts of it had turned completely black, and most trees in our vicinity had been totally smashed to bits. The place was a mess. And the cause of it all was the massive corpse that lay beside us, the dragon whose scales were dyed a deep shade of black. Right. I remember now. I fought the bastard and won. And then I finished him by sawing off his head.Executing the asshole was my last memory. Everything that followed was blank, which meant I had probably collapsed on the spot. I had quite literally pushed myself to my limits. You know, even I’m having trouble believing that I’m actually still alive after all that.“Wait… What happened to all my wounds?”I directed my gaze down towards my own body to find that, while my clothes were still all messed up, I was no longer injured. There wasn’t even a single trace of the many injuries that I had endured. My arm was back, my wings were back, everything could move again, and I no longer looked like a walking corpse. That said, it wasn’t all good news. My body felt sluggish, really sluggish. My body didn’t really seem to want to listen to my commands.“Did you fix me up, Lefi?”
“I did. I am the Supreme Dragon, a veritable symbol of power. Healing your wounds was but an act of child’s play,” said the silver-haired maiden. “But though I have restored your flesh, I cannot restore the blood that you have lost. You would best remain still and rest.”
“Thanks,” I chuckled as I listened to her brag. “Wait, I could’ve sworn I filled this whole area with poison. What happened to all of it?”
“Worry not, I have already dispersed it. It shan’t affect us.”
“I see… thanks.” I smiled. “And sorry. It seems like I’ve been making you clean up after me.”
“Fret not, for you are my partner. It is only natural for me to assist you in resolving the aftermath of your actions, especially in a case such as this.” Lefi smiled. “For the task in which you involved yourself was engaging in my protection.”
“So how do you think I did?”
“Splendidly, for you have succeeded in ensuring the defeat of your foe.”
“Then I guess it was worth pushing myself so hard after all.”It’s nice to know that getting my body punched full of holes actually paid off.“And push you did. Your actions were rash, as those that dare to challenge dragons are often known to their peers as naught but madmen,” said Lefi. “I know that, while you may hide behind a facade of tranquillity, you are too quick to lose your temper. Have you thought not of the extent to which I was concerned for your well being?”I didn’t really have much of a comeback, so I ended up laughing off her comment instead of denying it. “It was cool though, right?”
“I will at least admit that you impressed me much more than he.” The way Lefi laughed as she spoke was so lovely I was sure it brought a smile to my face.
“Hey, Lefi?”
“What is it?”
“I love you.”She didn’t seem to know how to react, as her whole body suddenly stiffened up in response to my words. I used her lack of action as a cue to keep talking.“Hell, saying I love you is an understatement. It’s more than just that. I’m totally head over heels for you.”
“W-why is it that you are suddenly professing your affections!?” Her face turned a deep shade of red as she finally processed the words I had just said to her.Only after hearing her flustered response did I realize that she was right. I tilted my head in confusion. Huh. What’s gotten into me? I guess my head’s probably still all messed up because of how hard I pushed myself. Like, seriously, I thought I was going to die. Anyway, enough with the excuses and shit.“I know that I’m not really the best match for you as I am right now. Hell, I’m so weak I struggled to beat a wimp that doesn’t even know how to fight. But I’ll do my best to get stronger. And one day, I’ll get strong enough to stand right by your side. I hope that’s okay.”
“You need not debase yourself any further,” chuckled Lefi. She seemed to have, for the most part, gotten over her embarrassment. There was still a twinge of red on her face, but she was able to address me in the same way as usual.In fact, she seemed to be slowly taking her time and carefully choosing her words. And once she was finally done, she spoke in a manner almost reminiscent of a declaration.“I have witnessed the extent of your courage with my very own eyes. The manner in which you carried yourself in battle was so impressive that I found myself fascinated by your abilities. I need not see you grow to know that you will, Yuki. I know that one day you shall achieve strength that mirrors my own. And that you may perhaps even go further beyond.”
“So I’ve even been certified by the mighty Supreme Dragon herself huh? What an honour.” A smile appeared on my face as I forced my groggy, unresponsive body to move. Slowly but surely, I raised a hand towards the silver-haired girl’s cheek.“I love you, Lefi. I’m so hopelessly in love with you that I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t ever want you to leave my side. So, Lefi, won’t you take my hand and forever stay by my side?”
“I believe that most others in your circumstances would have asked a question more akin to ‘would you not be mine?’”
“Making you mine would mean putting shackles on you and taking away your freedom. And I don’t want that. I want you to be you. I want you to be free to do whatever it is that you want.”
“That is quite the interesting manner of expressing your wishes.” Lefi chuckled as she placed a hand on the one I had against her cheek.“Yuki.” She looked at me with a smile full of affection. “If it is what you desire, then I, Leficios, shall remain by your side for all of eternity.”She slowly brought her face towards mine and pressed her lips against mine.The sensation was soft, sweet, and pleasant. So wonderful it was that I could almost feel my mind melt away as I allowed myself to enjoy it. Through her lips, I could feel her warmth, her burning passion. Her feelings flowed into me and mine into her. It was like we had become one.I didn’t know exactly how long it had lasted. It could have been seconds, minutes, or even longer. But I knew that it had eventually come to an end when she slowly pulled away. She had only inched just a bit backwards. She was still right there with me.And just as we had the moment I had awoken, we gazed into each other’s eyes.“This is pretty embarrassing,” I said as I felt a blush slowly creep on my face.
“Bearing with my own embarrassment has proven quite rewarding,” giggled Lefi. “I would not have had the chance to see that look on your face had I not.”Her cheeks were still as red as a tomato, but she had a mischievous look on her face. It was an innocent expression, like that of a child that had just finished playing a prank. It was adorable. She was so beautiful that my eyes were drawn to her. I couldn’t avert my gaze even if I wanted to. And as I stared, my heart began to pound.“D-Do not be mistaken, Yuki,” she stammered. “For the touch of our lips was merely a part of a draconic ritual.”
“Mhmmmm…” I nodded knowingly. Totally not suspicious at all. “And what kind of ritual would that be?”
“O-One that merely designates you as my mate,” she said with a blush. “Wait! I demand that you explain that smug grin of yours immediately!”
“Iunno what you’re talking about. I’m not acting any different, it’s totally just you,” I played dumb, just to tease her. “But anyway, I guess that means you’re basically my wife now, doesn’t it?”
“Y-Your wife…!?” Lefi squeaked. “I-I suppose that it does, but do not allow this change in our status to get to your head! I shall become quite angry should you continue to gather young women.”
“Alright, now hold up a sec, oh bride of mine. Just putting it out there, but I’ve never intentionally gone out of my way just to increase the little girl count ‘round these parts.”Seriously, why’s she always gotta blame me for this anyway? It’s not my fault! They just keep springing up outta nowhere. I swear to god I have no idea how or why it keeps happening, but it’s not my fault!As much as I wanted to keep complaining, I couldn’t. Even just looking at Lefi made me break into a smile.“What is it?” She asked as she noticed that I was staring at her.
“Oh, you know. I was just thinking about it ‘cause I called you my bride just now, but I actually really like the way that sounds.”
“I-I would really have preferred if you kept thoughts like that one to yourself. They are rather embarrassing to hear.”
“Yeah, well you’re cute as hell when you’re embarrassed. What’s the problem?”
“D-Did I not just ask you to stop that!?”Watching her reactions made me smile. She was acting like she was mad, but I could tell that she wasn’t anywhere near as dissatisfied as she was making herself out to be.“Hey Lefi. Wanna give me another?”
“I suppose it cannot be helped. I will indulge you.”The dragon girl immediately understood exactly what I wanted. She made sure to put on a show of exasperation, but despite that, she didn’t turn me down.Instead, she slowly lowered her lips and once again pressed them against my own.<– Prev — Next –>

The Aftermath — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix“You ignored me the whole time…” complained Enne. “Even though I was really worried too…”
“M-My bad. Come on Enne, cheer up. I said I’m sorry already.”My attempt to appease the black-haired girl’s displeasure was met with silence. Though she was currently situated on my lap, she absolutely refused to meet my gaze. She turned her head away from me each and every single time I tried to look at her. The pout that decorated the girl who normally just remained expressionless was a treasure. It was so rare and adorable that I couldn’t help but want to snap a picture just to keep it forever preserved.“Okay, okay, how’s about I spend the rest of the day with you to make up for it. I’ll even do anything you want, within reason of course,” I said. “The only catch is no more frowning, okay?”Come on Enne, you’re breaking daddy’s heart here.“Really?” She had yet to turn to face me, but hearing my desperate offer finally led the girl to stop avoiding my gaze.Enne’s anger was justified. She had been worried because I had collapsed immediately after defeating the mentally challenged lizard, and yet, I may or may not have ended up completely ignoring her after I woke up. In fact, I hadn’t even acknowledged her because I was too busy flirting with Lefi to notice much of anything else at all. Yeah, no wonder she’s mad. Who wouldn’t be, in her shoes?Although they weren’t actually supposed to know that there even was a battle, let alone one against a dragon, it turned out that all the dungeon’s residents had actually been quite worried about me. Making my way back to the true throne room with Lefi propping me up had caused every single one of the girls to react. The wraiths, whom I had evacuated to the true throne room, had joined Illuna in glomping me whilst crying. Shii, on the other hand, panicked as she tried to cast as much healing magic on me as she could as quickly as she could. The five of them combined had caused the scene of my return to degenerate into one of complete chaos.I didn’t really understand why at first, but turning to the only two individuals that had remained rational, the maids, provided me with an explanation of the status quo. Apparently, my battle with the Douchelord had caused those within the dungeon to experience a series of small earthquake-like tremors. In other words, the combination of all the shaking, the looks that Lefi and I had on our faces as we left, and the fact that I had come back on the verge of collapse had frightened our resident children.Wait. The dungeon was shaking? I had always assumed that the dungeon was its own thing, that it was effectively cut off from the rest of the world with the exception of its entrance, but the fact that it shook suggested that my hypothesis was likely inaccurate. The dungeon shaking implied that it occupied a space somewhere nearby. However, there was simply no way for the floor that I had set up to truly fit within the mountain it was located within. I guess that means the dungeon is probably messing with the spacetime continuum in order to create a massive subspace that occupies a much smaller space in the real world or something like that.…I guess that means fighting near the true throne room wasn’t exactly the best idea, huh? The cave that led into the dungeon’s depths had in fact caved in because the dragon had hit the vicinity with a relatively weak attack. Yeah uh… probably wouldn’t have been pretty if that had been one of his more powerful attacks, huh? Yeah, I’mma just use hardening all around here to make sure nothing ever breaks. I don’t exactly want everyone to end up getting buried alive.The girls living inside the castle weren’t the only ones that had sensed my duel to the death. Rir had as well and he had wanted to come running over, but I specifically instructed him to stay away because I knew that the battle against the Black Douchebag was one that I had to win on my own. Rir, however, seemed to interpret it as a matter of incompetence. The diligent wolf had visited the castle to check on me after the battle and left with a troubled, brooding look on his face. It was obvious that he was thinking of getting stronger so he could eliminate my enemies before I was stuck dealing with them. You know, as a dungeon master and whatnot, I’m happy to see him wanna strive for greater heights, but I hope he doesn’t stress himself out over it. I should get Leila to cook him something special sooner or later. I’m sure he’d like that. His minions’ll probably be over the moon about it too.“Really. So what do you want me to do, Enne?” I peaked at her face from my cross-legged position on top of the throne.
“Hmmm…” She paused for a moment. “Then stay still.”
“That’s it?”
“Mhm. All I want is to be with you, Master.”Enne flashed a brief, barely noticeable smile before leaning into my chest.“That’s so not fair! I was really worried because you slept like a log and wouldn’t get up after, Yuki!” Illuna, who noticed Enne’s position, shouted a complaint. “I wanna sit on your lap too!”
“M-my bad. Alright Illuna, come here,” I said. “Enne, can you scoot over so there’s a bit more space for her?”
“Okay.”A hand reached over from the side and placed itself on my cheek right as Illuna got on my lap. It was accompanied by a nice cool sensation, one not that different from gel.“Are you really okay, Master? You’re really not hurt?” asked the hand’s owner.
“Oh come on Shii, I said I’m fine already, didn’t I?” I moved my arms around a bit in order to prove my point. “See? I’m all healed up.”
“Are you really sure…?” The slime continued to question me, her voice filled with worry. “Because I know you like to act like you’re okay when you’re not.”Her actions and questions served to demonstrate that, like Rir, she was able to roughly sense my condition and see through me in ways that the other little girls couldn’t. And while they weren’t currently present, the same more or less went for the wraiths. They continued to act like they were concerned for my well being even after I’d regained most of my strength. I had the sneaking suspicion that, like Rir, they were concerned over their abilities and wanted to do something about the whole situation because they too were monsters spawned by the dungeon.“I’m kinda happy you’re so worried about me Shii, but I’m really okay. I’m fit as a sailor pumped full of spinach.”
“Really?”
“Really.”
“Are you good as new?” asked the slime.
“Yup. I’ve been oiled up and all my parts have been swapped for new ones. So yeah, I might as well be good as new.”I spotted Lefi out of the corner of my eye as I tried my best to cope with the three little girls and their concerns.“To think that this is my husband.” Seeing me in my current state caused the dragon to heave a heavy sigh and shake her head in exasperation. “I’ve little choice but to label myself pathetic for falling for him.”
“Oh shut up, Lefi.” I rolled my eyes. “I know what you’re thinking, but you don’t need to say it. I’m self-conscious enough about it already.”Though I complained at her, I wasn’t exactly much in the way of discontent. If anything, I was happy. Hearing her call me her husband had caused my heart to jump in a way I wasn’t really used to.A lot had changed since I took down my most recent foe. My character sheet was a far cry from what it had been before the battle. It now looked as follows.***

***Sooooo…. Yeaaaaahh… I’m uh… a lot stronger now. Yeah. That. Even just looking at my stats was enough to make my jaw drop. Both my HP and my vitality had spiked. Taking hits nonstop even while on the verge of death had caused both to grow disproportionately. My luck was well… my luck. Everything else had at least doubled, but my luck still seemed a good bit under 100. But hey, at least it’s actually going up.All the skills I used against the oversized lizard had levelled up significantly, and I had even gotten myself a brand new pair of unique skills: Tenacity and Sovereign Pressure. It wasn’t actually my first time seeing the Tenacity skill, but I hadn’t been able to analyze it back when I fought the orichalcum class adventurer, but now that I actually had a chance to look at it, I learned that its effect was to drastically diminish all incoming damage and boost all stats by a factor of 1.5 when at or under 20% HP. Y’know, that’s actually OP as fuck. And now that I think about it, I probably got this thing mid-combat. I remember his attacks basically stopped doing damage near the end.Like Tenacity, Sovereign Pressure also seemed fairly useful. Its effect was to generate an aura of intimidation capable of hampering all nearby enemies by making it more difficult for them to take action. The strength of its effect was influenced by the relative difference in stats between me and my foes. However, unlike Tenacity, I had no idea as to exactly why I had obtained the skill. I don’t remember doing anything like freaking people out.After poking around, I learned that it came from one of my newly acquired titles, one whose description read as follows.***
Demon Lord; King of the Dragons: This is a title granted to the demon lord who defeated the king of the dragons and thereby inherited his position as Dragonlord. It provides an extreme boost to charisma when engaged in conversation with a dragon, and grants a unique skill by the name of Sovereign Pressure.
***Welp. Looks like I’m king of the dragons now. I mean, I don’t really mind the title itself since it makes me look like a total badass, but like, Iunno if it’s actually really okay for me to have it. Like, I kinda don’t have any plans to rule the dragons or whatever. Governing their village sounds like a headache and a half. I’m so not down. Seriously, they can solve their own problems. What they do ain’t my business. Actually, this title is probably why my class ended up changing.One interesting thing about the Dragon/Demon Lord of Judgement class was that its details couldn’t be viewed. Neither Analyze nor the dungeon’s menu system could tell me much about its effects. But, that said, I did know for a fact that it did something. I felt as if my body was now much easier to control, and that my movements were more precise following my class change. Moreover, I had also confirmed that my magic was now much more powerful than it should have been otherwise. I had the feeling that there was more to it, but despite my curiosity, I was unable to determine the new class’ precise effects.As far as titles went, Demon Lord; King of the Dragons was only one of my three newly acquired entities. The second read as follows:***
Survivor of Death’s Embrace: This title is granted to one who has survived being pushed to the absolute brink of death. All of the title owner’s stats are doubled if their HP drops below 10% of its maximum value.
***Much like the first, it was a title whose origin I could understand. I managed to beat the dragon in combat for the sole reason that he was an idiot. But that said, his stupidity didn’t change the fact that the fight had been a tough one. I had almost died; I may as well have had a foot in the grave the entire time. Dude, that double stats thing is a friggin’ eye popper. I probably would have screamed incoherently about balance if it wasn’t so hard to activate. Man, 10% health? That’s rough.Unlike the first two, my final title had nothing to do with combat.***
Supreme Dragon’s Spouse: This is a title granted to the man that has proven his valour by making a bride of the dragon that reigns supreme over the world. The man in question probably no longer needs to know fear.
***Probably? The fuck? Telling me I probably don’t need to fear anything doesn’t actually give me any useful information at all! Like, what the fuck do you mean probably!? Shouldn’t these things be dealt in absolutes!? And who the hell wrote this stupid ass description anyway? It looks more like a goddamn opinion than it does anything actually objective. Was it God? God, please, you really gotta step up your title game. Like, come on, what the hell!? In the end, I decided to set aside its shoddy description and its questionable origins and just think of it as something that I was a bit embarrassed to have.My battle with Lizardbrain had consumed most of my DP. I had literally used so much of it that I ended up with a two digit number. However, killing him and chucking his corpse in the recycling bin had provided me with a hefty profit. I guess he really was a member of this world’s most powerful race after all, even if the only thing he had in that thick skull of his was a rotten potato.While I did enjoy my recent stat changes, I wasn’t entirely sure how I was supposed to feel about them. Aside from bewildered, of course. The issue stemmed from the fact that my sudden explosive gains had translated themselves to real-life applications in a rather questionable manner. My newfound power was hard to control and therefore kept interfering with my regular day to day activities. I kept breaking cups, shattering plates, and once, I had even accidentally crushed the armrest of one of my chairs because I had accidentally gripped it just a bit too hard. Similar things happened so many times now that I didn’t really have much of a choice but to awkwardly laugh it off whenever it happened. Hey… wait a second. Does this mean I’ll actually be strong enough to carry out that genocide I’ve been planning? Oh, hell yes. Fuck manticores! I’m going to wipe every single last one of those assholes off the face of this planet and have their stupid ass species officially marked as extinct!One of the reasons that my stats had grown so drastically was because my latest encounter had caused the dungeon to gain a pair of levels of its own. That said, I didn’t actually evolve this time around. Wait. Shouldn’t evolving be what causes stat spikes? I’m confused.Another interesting thing of note was that my level and my stats had grown in a non-linear fashion. Each level seemed to provide a larger stat boost than the last. Huh. You know, my stats actually might end up as high as Lefi’s by the time I catch up to her. Hell, they might even end up higher at this rate.While I was happy with where my stats were at, I wasn’t exactly content with my level. It hadn’t changed as much as I was hoping despite the fact that I had defeated something way higher level than me. Oh god. Grinding levels is hard. Is it just me, or does it seem like matching Lefi’s level is gonna take a few thousand years…?<– Prev — Next –>

The Aftermath — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixThe influx of experience that the dragon had brought me came with a side of skill points. And of course, I did the usual and immediately threw a bunch of them into Analyze. With plenty of newfound power invested in it, the skill finally hit its maximum level.I still had a fair number of skill points remaining, but I decided to save them for later. Using them immediately felt like a waste. I would only be able to max out one or two of my skills at best given their current levels, and it was possible for skills to level through use, so I figured that there was no harm in letting them grow as nature intended. I might consider spending my points if something gets to level 8 or 9 and ends up being too much of a pain to grind, I guess.Maxing Analyze had proven to be quite the choice. It now showed additionals and even enabled me to see more of Lefi’s character sheet.***

***Oh, who am I kidding? It’s honestly not all that different. The most important bit of information my level 10 skill provided me was the number of digits Lefi had in each of her stats. Her mana pool lay somewhere in the hundreds of millions, while her health pool was one order of magnitude less. It was such a ridiculously high number that I felt she may as well have been immortal. I didn’t really see any way anyone could put much of a dent in her.Her other basic stats were equally as incredible. Her dexterity was in the tens of thousands and her magic in the millions, while almost everything else rested somewhere in the hundreds of thousands. Seriously? Holy shit, those are some inflated as fuck numbers.I had no doubt that Lefi was in the realm of abominations and that standing by her meant entering it myself. Well, I guess I better work hard to make myself out to be some sort of freak of nature as soon as I possibly can. I mean, turning into a world-ending abomination does sound kinda like the sort of stuff a demon lord would be up to anyway, doesn’t it?While Lefi’s stats had more or less turned out as expected, the same didn’t quite go for her skills. I was anticipating well over a hundred, but it turned out she only had a few dozen. Oh, I get it. It must be because a specialized build where you use a few skills really well is much better than an allrounder build where you have so much shit you can’t even use it all. Though, it might also just be that I can’t see all of them quite yet. The text is still garbled, after all.Likewise, all but two of Lefi’s titles were unreadable, and of them, only one was new. It read as follows:***
Demon Lord’s Spouse: A title granted to a bride that has chosen a demon lord by the name of Yuki as her groom. Not a single one of this world’s denizens would have ever imagined that the Supreme Dragon would actually manage to find herself a mate.
***“…”Anyway, moving on. I suspected that the only reason I could see the Supreme Dragon and Demon Lord’s Spouse titles was that Lefi had intentionally made them visible. So I guess she wants people to know. Oh man, I’m blushing. I can totally feel it. You know what, I’mma just stop thinking about this and move on.Lefi hadn’t actually explained much about what had happened, whereas I had passed out after returning to the dungeon. As such, I only managed to update its residents after I woke up the next day. I told everyone about both the fight and the fact that Lefi and I had started a relationship.Everyone was thrilled by the news. The maids reacted with girly cheers, while each and every single little girl immediately asked to be made into wives themselves. I had expected as such from Illuna, Shii, and the wraith girls, so I wasn’t really all that surprised. Enne, on the other hand, had completely blindsided me by making the very same request, albeit in her usual shy way. Aight, now hold the phone and stop trying to call the FBI. Just sayin’, I did, in fact, turn them down.Of course, I was glad that the girls liked me as much as they did, but the way Lefi was smiling told me that she wouldn’t forgive me humouring them. In the end, I tried to gloss the whole thing over by telling them to wait until they got older. Oh man, I’m pretty sure that’s going to come back and bite me in the ass in a few years. I just know it. But like, what the hell else was I supposed to say? Ahahaha… hahaha… haha… Help.The change in my relationship with Lefi was something that the dungeon itself picked up on immediately. It began considering her as a part of my family, which meant that the DP she generated had vanished into thin air. She gave a lot, so the change had dented my wallet a fair bit. Still, I wasn’t exactly complaining given that it was a part of a comprehensive package that I very much desired. The realization that she no longer provided DP really made the fact that we had become family hit home. Oh, great. I’m blushing again. And smiling like an idiot too. Anyway, I might as well think of all the time I spent getting DP from Lefi as something along the lines of a bonus stage in a game. You know, the kind with lots of free loot. Besides, the dungeon’s pretty big now, so we’re still pretty well off, I’d say.“Hey Master! Hey Master!” The more obnoxious of the dungeon’s maids pulled on the hem of my shirt whilst wearing a shit-eating grin. She, Leila, and I were the only ones present still awake. Illuna and Enne had fallen asleep on my lap, whereas Shii had clocked out while leaning against the throne. Being as good at her job as she was, Leila had immediately noticed and put all three girls to bed.“What, Lyuu?”
“I’ve been meanin’ to ask you ‘bout that thing you’ve got on your finger there, Master. Is it what I think it is?” She pointed towards the accessory I had on my left ring finger, one that would read as follows if analyzed:***
Engagement Ring
MP: 1002
Quality: S+
Description: A ring that the Supreme Dragon, Leficios, carefully crafted over a long period of time.***The design was similar to that of the ring I had bought Lefi when we visited the old dude’s city; it was a simple silver ring with a line running across the center and another perpendicular line that intersected with it to form a cross. There was a gem, a green emerald, embedded right where the two lines met. Unlike the ring that I had given her, it was made of dragon scale as opposed to silver, so it didn’t quite feel anywhere near as metallic to the touch.As Analyze had been completely maxed out, I was able to see the raw materials that had gone into the item. Specifically, they were Lefi’s fangs, Lefi’s scales, and a magic stone—a rock made of crystallized magical energy. I wasn’t exactly sure where she got the last of the three ingredients, but I remember seeing her pick up a few of her own fangs and scales back when we were at her nest. Does that mean she was planning to make this for me all this time? Wow.Lefi didn’t have any skills that aided her in the crafting process, so she had instead constructed the ring by channelling her mana through the raw materials and forcing them to change their form. It was an act only made possible by the fact that, magic stone aside, they all used to be a part of her.Lefi’s fangs and scales were quite literally the best materials that this world had to offer, so the ring had ended up with an absurdly high S+ quality rating. It even had its own mana pool alongside a pair of slots in which I could carve magic circuits. The item was something on the grade of a national treasure. Even the ring that the prince wore had only a single slot on it.Seeing the difference between the ring she gave me and the ring I’d gotten her, which I had quite literally purchased off of a random vendor, made me feel like I hadn’t done her justice. I had offered to make her something new, something that actually had a special effect or two, but she had turned me down. The dragon had taken quite a liking to the one she already had. Oh well. I guess I can always just get her a nicer one as like a random present or something sometime later. It’s not like there are any rules stating that you can’t give a girl more than one ring, after all.“Oh? That? Yeah, it’s probably exactly what you think it is,” I said. “I got it from Lefi.”
“Wow Master, good job! And Lefi’s really shown’ her stuff too, huh?” Lyuu grinned as she poked me over and over with her elbow. “So Master, how does it feel to be a lady killer?”I found her behavior irritating, so I grabbed her cheeks and started pulling them in all different directions.“Aaahh! My face! That hurts, Master! I’m sorry! I’m real sorry, so leggo already!” The maid screamed a series of distorted words. “Y-You really gotta stop, Master! My cheeks are tearin’ right off! You’re gonna ruin my face!”She started hitting my arms with a teary look in her eyes, so I finally forgave and released her.“Ughh…” She groaned as she massaged her cheeks. “You’re so mean, Master. How could ya go ahead ‘n do somethin’ like that? I think you’ve just about ruined my chances of makin’ myself a bride.”
“Yeah, totally.” I rolled my eyes. “Because having someone mess with your cheeks totally ruins you and makes you too impure for marriage.”
“Uh huh, ’cause it’s like turnin’ me into damaged goods.”
Again, I felt the urge to roll my eyes. You know, sometimes, I think this girl’s acting all cheeky and shameless and shit, but then I always realize that she’s actually just an idiot.“Why’re you lookin’ at me like that Master? You seem all tensed up and serious.”
“Nah, it’s nothing important,” I said. “I just happened to be thinking that you’re an idiot.”
“W-What the heck master!? You’re just straight up bad mouthin’ me now!” Lyuu’s jaw dropped in astonishment.
“Nah, not really. It’s more of an honest impression than it is an insult.”
“That just makes it even worse!” she shouted indignantly. “Would ya listen to this, Leila!? Master’s bullyin’ the heck outta me!”
“I’m sorry Lyuu,” said the demon girl, “but he does have a point.”
“Wow! Even Leila’s turned traitor!? I can’t believe you guys!”Lyuu threw her hands up in indignation.“Why is it that you feel the urge to make all this noise?” Lefi rubbed her eyes as she got out of bed. It seemed that the noise created by all our laughter had awoken her. Like the trio of little girls that had passed out on or near me, Lefi had also taken an early afternoon nap. In fact, she was the first to go to bed.“Come on, Lyuu, inside voice,” I scolded the maid teasingly. “You’re going to wake up everyone at this rate.”
“Whaddya mean, Master!? How the heck was that my fault!? You guys were the ones makin’ fun o’ me!” Lyuu immediately started shouting again but I ignored her complaints as I turned to face the dragon girl.
“Morning Lefi,” I said. “You know, now that I think about it, you sure spend a lot of time sleeping, huh? How the hell do you manage that?”
“You may attribute my lack of energy to the form that I have taken,” said Lefi. “It expends little and thus promotes a desire for inactivity.”
“Uh huh… You know, I might have actually believed you if you never told me about how you basically sleep around all day even in your dragon form.”
“…”
“And I’m pretty sure not saying anything is basically the same as telling me I’m right.”My response was met with silence. Lefi averted her eyes and said nothing—a response that prompted me to offer a wry smile. It’s okay Lefi, I understand. You’re just totally depraved and so lazy that you’ve gone far beyond the point of salvation.Seeing my reaction caused the silver-haired maiden to cough as if to clear her throat and immediately moved the conversation past the accusation it had stopped on.“I suppose I shall be off for yet another short nap. Do try to keep quiet if you would not mind it,” she said. “I believe that rest would be in your best interest as well, Yuki, as I know that you have yet to fully recover.”Yeah, I figured she of all people would know.Shii’s intuition, the part of her that told her I probably wasn’t okay, had been right on the mark. Though I had put on a show of being perfectly fine, the truth was that I had been forcing myself to seem that way because I didn’t want the girls to worry. I was still feeling awfully lethargic. My body was dull. I didn’t have full control of it just yet. The sensation was similar to the kind you got when you happened to catch a really bad cold.It made sense, of course. I had gone through a series of cycles where it took an incredible amount of punishment and then was restored, only to take yet another round of punishment. I would have been more surprised if I hadn’t experienced any sort of side effect.“Well, might as well then,” I said. “Hey Leila, could you wake me up in about an hour?”
“Of course, My Lord.”
“Thanks.”I headed towards a nearby resting spot as soon as the maid responded. Specifically, I made right for Lefi’s favourite.“Why is it that you are attempting to enter my bed?”
“Well, as I’m sure you can see, mine’s occupied,” I said with a shrug. “And I’d feel bad for the girls if I ended up waking them the moment I tried crawling in.”
“Then I suppose it simply cannot be helped.” Lefi sighed before patting the spot next to her. “Come. I shall allow you to rest by my side.”
“Thanks Wifey,” I said before turning back towards the saltier of the two maids. “And what, Lyuu? Why the blank stare?”
“No reason, Master, no reason at all…” she said, unamused.And that was how everything had changed after I put down my good friend the Dysfunctionlord. Actually, on second thought, I don’t really think much of anything’s changed at all.***TL Note

Enhancing Zaien
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“Alright, you ready, Enne?”
“Anytime.” The blade seemed nervous. Her voice was filled with an unusual stiffness.I moved forward with my plans nonetheless and pressed the item in my hand against her blade. She made the kind of sound a kid would when getting a shot as the thing I was holding integrated itself into her body. I analyzed her the moment it vanished in order to check her stats.***

***“Looks like it worked,” I said with a satisfied nod. “So, how do you feel? Anything seem off at all?”
“No. I’m fine.”Her words came with a surge of happiness. It seemed that she too could tell that she had gotten stronger and was happy with the result. I’m glad that went as well as it did.Zaien’s attack and durability had both basically doubled since I last checked. The changes stemmed from a pair of reasons. The first was that she had drunk a significant amount of the Retardlord’s blood. And the second was due to the action that I had quite literally just taken: strengthening her by merging her blade with one of Lefi’s fangs.Weapon Transmutation used to come with a clause that stated that I could only ever transmute something once. Levelling the skill had caused that part of its description to change. It was now capable of performing the act up to twice on any individual piece of gear. And as Zaien was my main weapon, I immediately settled on boosting her stats with the most powerful materials I had on hand.As usual, Lefi never failed to disappoint. Merging her fang with Zaien’s blade had made the sword noticeably sharper.Enne’s stats weren’t the only thing that had changed about her either. Defeating Lefi’s mentally deficient acquaintance had led her to obtain a new title. Analyzing it provided the following description:***
Dragonslayer: This weapon is especially effective against dragons. It is capable of rending their flesh, shredding their scales, and depriving them of their lives. All dragons are left vulnerable before its blade; none may defend against it. All stats are increased by 50% when in combat against a dragon.***Though violent encounters with dragons didn’t exactly fall into the realm of normal, I had the sneaking suspicion that Enne’s Dragonslayer title was going to prove useful in the future regardless. I had, for some godforsaken reason, ended up as the King of Dragons, so I figured I was probably going to get involved with them eventually, one way or another. Well, Ms. Dragonslayer, I’ll be counting on you whenever the inevitable decides to rear its ugly head.Despite the fact that the skill quite literally said that all were left vulnerable before Enne’s blade, she still couldn’t cut through Lefi’s scales. They were just that tough. But how!? It literally says… oh whatever.Another thing that Enne had gained was the ability to cast wind magic. Unlike Crimson Blaze, her newfound aptitude for spellslinging didn’t stem from a magic circuit. It was simply something she had learned through the use of a skill scroll. You know, I’m almost starting to think that Enne being able to use skill scrolls basically deprecates her magic circuits.I still wanted to fill the last two magic circuit slots she had, of course. However, I hadn’t done so just yet. I wanted to wait until I finished grinding Enchant all the way to its maximum level in order to see exactly what it unlocked before making my decision. Active abilities seemed nice and all, but they weren’t exactly what I would call cost-effective. They burned far too much mana in order to achieve their effects. That was why I was instead looking for something that would passively support me. Ideally, I wanted something that would enhance either my physical or magical strikes. As far as I could tell, that seemed to be the kind of thing that Enchant would probably provide me with, as it had already unlocked several similar circuits. For example, there was one that provided whatever it was carved on with passive poison damage.Of course, one of the first things I did when considering magic circuits was to ask the resident expert, but unfortunately, it turned out that support magic lay outside Leila’s field of expertise. She told me that she could probably figure something out, but that it would take quite a bit of time. I didn’t really feel like putting her through all the trouble, so I decided to just call it off. Actually, now that I think about it, why don’t I just dump all my skill points into Enchant and call it a day? You know what? Might as well. Skill points exist to be used, after all. There’s honestly not that much of a point in holding onto them.With my decision made, I opened up the menu and dumped my points into the skill, thereby taking it all the way from level 5 to 10 on the spot.The first three magic circuits unlocked by the skill were Bursting Embers, Inferno Blizzard, and Nightmare. They were interesting, but I decided to ignore them for the time being. They were active spells, and I wasn’t all that keen on turning my primary weapon into a mana sink. Might work well on a sidearm though.Of all the magic circuits I had, the ones unlocked at levels 8, 9, and 10 were the most eye-catching. They were more or less the exact things I had been looking for. They enhanced magical prowess, physical attack power, and regeneration respectively. To top it all off, all three of the circuits were the most powerful versions of their respective enchantments.“Alright Enne, you ready for your new Magic Circuits?”
“Mhm.”I pressed the palm of my hand against her blade, activated Enchant, and carved two of the three effects into her magic circuit slots. Doing so added a new category to her character sheet.***

***Heh. Sweet. Looks like little Ms. Enne here is getting hella strong. Enne was no longer the only weapon whose stats I could see. Maxing my Analyze skill had provided me with the ability to see exact numbers on other types of weapons as well. Looking at the many things I had stashed away in storage provided me with a rough idea of how weapons were tiered based on their values. I ended up loosely defining them as follows:Inferior Weapons
Attack: 50-150
Durability: 30-200
MP: NoneCommon Weapons
Attack: 150-300
Durability: 200-400
MP: NoneUncommon Weapons
Attack: 300-600
Durability: 400-700
MP: NoneRare Weapons
Attack: 600-900
Durability: 700-1100
MP: VariesLegendary Weapons
Attack: 900+
Durability: 1100+
MP: VariesThe guidelines derived from my observations dictated that Zaien was effectively on the tier of a legendary blade. I wonder how strong the hero’s sword is. Probably about the same, actually. I wasn’t able to figure anything out last time I saw her ‘cause it was cockblocking me with some sort of enchantment, but with my stats the way they are now, I think I might actually be able to check it out anyway. Come on Nell, where the hell are you? Whatever happened to coming over and hanging out and stuff?Though I was curious, I wasn’t actually all that hung up on how Enne compared to Nell’s holy blade. The plan was to make her the world’s most powerful sword, and as it stood, Enne was still on the weaker end of weapons in her tier; I was planning to keep beefing her up regardless. She’s growing up so fast.Enchanting Zaien had been today’s goal, but I figured that I might as well slot a few circuits into the ring that Lefi had given me while I was at it. After a moment’s consideration, I ended up deciding to give the ring the magic and regeneration buffs. The regeneration one seemed particularly useful. It would cause my HP to automatically recover so long as I had the ring equipped. Combining its effect with my now inflated health pool turned me into one hell of a tank. Heh. Looks like I’m getting a good bit stronger too.“Alright Enne, you wanna go see how much stronger you are now?”
“Mhm. I can’t wait.”
“Then let’s do this!” I holstered the red and black blade on my shoulder and set a course for the great outdoors. “Lefi! I’m stepping out for a bit!”
“Very well. I shall inform the others.” With that said, the dragon casually waved in my direction and saw me off.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. I know, I know. I said in my last transmission that I’d do these notes a lot more, but give me a break! Boss translates too fast and it prevents me from scripting these shows in time. I know you guys would prefer a new chapter over my show, so I let boss release the chapters without filming the show for you guys. Plus, I’ve been very busy playing Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers. I’m level 76 now, so yay for me. If anyone’s interested in trying the game, it’s free up to level 35 on every job, so you can try a bit of everything and see if it’s right for you. If you do decide, my character is on the Primal Data Center on the Exodus server, so hmu on Discord if you play. Only a couple questions to get to today, since everyone was excited about what was happening in the story, so thanks to kx, Cassius, and Mrpurplecowface for your questions, and Tonatsi for the, unfortunately, continuing headpats. Seriously, why headpat me? Nirvash has a much more headpattable head. Pat hers.

Practicing Magic — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Is that all you’ve got?” I cackled like a maniac as I mocked the monsters before me. “Why are you so scared? What happened to those dumb looking smirks you had a second ago, huh?”Some tried to escape, but I chased them down and lopped off their heads before they could get much of anywhere at all. Their blood-curdling, dying cries rang through the Wicked Forest as they fell one after another. Although I normally would have reacted to their screams with displeasure, I found myself relishing in the exact opposite emotion. I ran rampant and launched all sorts of different attacks as I transformed the monsters into unrecognizable corpses. Not even larger groups could survive my wrath. I literally dove straight in and plowed my way through, killing everything I crossed in the process.Only after losing most of their members did the pride I had assaulted realize that defeating me was a pipe dream. The beautiful forest had been warped into a scene that looked as if it had been ripped straight from the seventh circle of hell. Blood, guts, and disfigured corpses lay strewn all over. A small group that I suspected to be a family turned and tried to run. But they couldn’t escape me.I flapped my wings, overtook them, and landed right in front of them.“Hah! Nice try,” I scoffed. “Did you really think I’d let you get away?”My grin was a complete contrast to the looks of despair worn by each of the family’s members. They launched one last desperate attack in an attempt to get a lucky hit on me; every single member of the family charged and attempted to rush me down. But I struck down even their very last sliver of hope with ease.“Not happening. Say your prayers, assholes!” I weaved between their attacks and decapitated them with just one stroke apiece. My actions were smooth. It was almost as if the whole dodge sequence had been a single fluid motion.Their deaths were followed by a roar, one that expressed a mix of decimation and rage. Its source was none other than the pride’s alpha, a creature significantly larger than its peers. Its anger and resentment were clearly reflected in its eyes. As the sole survivor of its pack, it stepped forward; it approached me in order to take me down and avenge its peers, roaring in provocation as it did. I responded to its challenge in the most natural manner possible.I roared back.Despite his irritation, the pride’s leader immediately froze in the midst of his charge. His anger was gone, nowhere to be seen. In its place was a look of terror. Huh. Sovereign Pressure seems pretty useful.Sovereign Pressure reminded me of the thing I had learned when I first visited a human settlement. Like dispersing mana laced with bloodlust through the air, it had the effect of terrifying my foes. Except better. It felt like more or less the same thing with a few upgrades slapped on top of it.One of the skill’s most appealing aspects was that it was extremely effective against weaklings like the one before me.“Oh come on, you’re bitching out already?” My prey took a step backwards, so I matched its action with a forward step to ensure that the distance between us remained unchanged. And as I did, I smirked.My choices inspired the alpha’s fear to grow. It began growing desperate, and, in the end, launched an attack in much the same manner as a cornered rat. But it didn’t matter. It was far too weak; I could see through its attacks as easily as I could a piece of glass.A metallic screech rang through the forest as I met his claws with Zaien’s blade.“What, that’s it? Alright, have fun in hell then.” I cackled as I swung my sword and defeated the last monster, the last manticore, left standing. Though I stood in the midst of a field of blood, guts, and gore, my voice was filled with rapture. “Oh man, that felt good.”
“You seem to be enjoying yourself, Master,” said Enne.
“Yeah, lots. I’ve been pretty pissed at these things ever since one bullied the hell out of us that one time.” I smiled. “And I gotta say, revenge turned out just about as sweet as I’d imagined.”Though I had intended on wiping them out, today’s encounter with the manticores was purely coincidental. I had felt rather confident in my newfound stats and I was fairly certain we would be able to make it at least halfway through the western region without too much issue, so Enne and I had decided to head towards the area with the toughest monsters in order to test out her blade. Wandering about had coincidentally led us to stumble across a group of our old “friends.”I immediately came to the conclusion that our chance meeting had been a bit more than just that. It wasn’t a coincidence. God was guiding me down the path of vengeance. With the will of the divine as my guide, I happily plunged into the midst of the manticore pride and tore it to shreds.In the past, I had thought of manticores as extremely powerful foes that could clobber Rir and I even if we worked together. But now, they were insignificant grunts I needed no effort to destroy. I know I said it already, but I really gotta say it again. Oh man, that felt good. Overpowering these bastards and wiping them out felt hella good.One unfortunate result of relishing in the slaughter came about as a result of letting myself get a bit too carried away. I started acting like a stereotypical villain. I wasn’t exactly keen on continuing the behaviour but figured that it wasn’t particularly unseemly given my identity as a demon lord.On the matter of identities, analyzing the largest manticore proved that he had been exactly who I had expected him to be: the pride’s alpha.***

***It seemed that the name of the AT Field-like ability was Magic Barrier. Its description confirmed that it consumed a set amount of mana in order to create a magical barrier capable of defending against magic-based attacks.Gazing at its corpse really got me thinking. The relationship between the manticores and I had been completely turned on its head. I had become the hunter, and they had become the hunted. Heh. You know, I almost pity the bastards, but they brought this shit onto themselves. I wouldn’t have cared this much about them if they were any less obnoxious.After contemplating the intricacies of assholes being assholes, I turned away from the manticore and looked over at my companion. He, my pet wolf and mount, was regarding me with the canine equivalent of a wry smile.“What’s up, Rir?”He shook his head and tried to play it off as if it was nothing, but upon reflecting on any potential causes, I came to realize that I wasn’t the only one that a manticore had pestered. Oops. Sorry boy, you must’ve wanted to kill one yourself. My bad. I probably shouldn’t have jacked all the kills.“Sorry, my bad.”The fenrir tilted his head questioningly.“Nah, it’s okay, I get it,” I said. “You were trying to let me have my fun, so you didn’t bother joining in even though you wanted to get them back for being douchewads. I’m sure there are still plenty of manticores around. I promise I’ll let you have a go at them next time we run into them.”“…” The wolf’s only response was to silently stare at me in exasperation.Yeah, I know, I know. I’m still kinda new to this whole boss thing. I gotta make sure I let my subordinates cut loose and don’t hog all the fun. Oh wait, that reminds me…“Uhhh, oops. Sorry Enne, I forgot to let you test out your wind magic.”“Mhm…” The sword on my shoulder responded in a tone laced with disappointment.Testing out the effects of my stat changes had definitely been a part of today’s plans, but it hadn’t been all that high on our list of priorities. Today was supposed to be all about Enne. Her ability to cast wind magic had been our top concern. Alright, before you say anything, I’mma just go ahead and say that I didn’t forget. I just didn’t expect everything to die so fast.…Okay no. That’s bullshit and I know it. I mean, everything dying too quickly was a part of it, but honestly, it was mostly ‘cause I let myself get carried away. Whoops.“Well uhhh… we’re kinda out of targets, but you wanna try doing the thing I talked to you about a bit earlier anyway?”
“Okay.”I held Enne behind me and channelled my magical energies through her. I activated Crimson Blaze and wreathed her in flame as she threw wind magic into the mix. Our efforts were met with an explosion; I was suddenly sent flying forward with all the force of a massive detonation.An incoherent scream left my mouth as I accelerated uncontrollably and sped right through the surrounding environment.“Raghghg!?” I couldn’t steer or affect my trajectory in any which way, so I ended up making a dumb sounding noise as I smashed face first into a tree and finally came to a stop.
“Oops. Are you okay, Master?” asked Enne in a worried tone.Like the sword, Rir also seemed quite concerned for my well being, as he quickly dashed over whilst barking in a tone containing a mix of panic and surprise.“Ow…” I shook my head from side to side to ward off the dizziness and rubbed the point of impact as I lamented over the failed experiment. The thing that Enne and I had just tried to do was use a mix of fire and wind to create the technological wonder that my people referred to as a jet engine.Specifically, I had Enne coat her blade in fire and then enclose the flames in a layer of wind. The fire would naturally cause any air it came in contact with to heat up. The idea was for her to eject the hot air out from the tip of her blade to produce propulsion. Project Jet Fuel was a result of looking back at my battle with the Potatolord and realizing that I hadn’t been quick enough to shake him off my tail. I had realized that I needed to think up a way to increase both my acceleration and my top speed, and the conclusion I had come to was to turn myself into a jet. You know what? I think I’mma actually call that one a success. I managed to get myself some crazy propulsion. All I need to do now is iron out the kinks.I began chuckling to myself as I worked everything out in my mind.“Master?”
“You see Enne, this, this is what we call a challenge.” A big grin appeared on my face as I continued to speak. “I’m going to master this and prove that nothing’s impossible. At least not for a demon lord like yours truly.”
“So… again?”
“Yup. Let’s do this!”I stood up, got Enne in position, and once again had her wreathe her blade in flame as Rir, the experiment’s sole observer, heaved an exasperated sigh.<– Prev — Next –>

Practicing Magic — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“This is awesome!” I voiced a shout filled with joy as I soared through the great blue with all the speed of a jet. I was going far faster than I ever had before. The scenery almost seemed to change every time I blinked. I found it a bit hard to breathe because the amount of wind pressure my body was subjected to had increased in proportion to my speed, but I continued nonetheless. It was one of the drawbacks that I had expected coming into the experiment. I really hope my next evolution can help me adapt a bit more to the sky life. Seriously. That’s all I really want out of it.My repeated experiments had taught me that using Enne to steer wasn’t the best way to control my newly developed engine, at least not on its own. The approach had led to a countless number of… incidents. I kept losing control and flying off in random directions. In fact, it happened so many times that I kept wanting to vomit despite my love for thrills. Only after a few good breaks did I finally realize that I had wings. Throwing them into the mix allowed me to adjust my posture and direct my flight much more accurately. It wasn’t perfect; I would still lose control the moment I stopped focusing, but it was still a much-needed improvement from the out of control roller coaster that it had been.Working it out had been quite the difficult problem, but I had done as I said I would; I saw it through. Heh. Goes to show that anything’s possible if you’re passionate enough. I’m way faster than that stupid asshole of a dragon now. Hell, I might even be able to outrun Lefi. No way in hell I’m not bragging to her about that.“How’s your MP looking?”
“Still fine,” said Enne.
“Alright, let’s try something else then. Hmm… what to do…” I pondered for a moment before turning my eyes down towards the ground. “Oh, perfect timing. It looks like there’s a practice dummy, er, monster coming right at us.”Enne and I had just happened to be fortunate enough to come across a wyvern, a creature we could use as a lab rat. Er, I mean a creature we can treat with dignity and respect. Yeah, that.It was coming from the area underneath and in front of us, and it was trying to use its wings to gain as much height as it could while screeching and squawking obnoxiously. As a territorial creature, the wyvern seemed to think of us as intruders that had invaded its domain. Biologically speaking, wyverns were more or less just defective dragons. And as we were even faster than dragons, their inferior cousins proved unable to catch us. Enne and I zoomed right past it, leaving it to follow behind us in an attempt to chase us out of its turf. But we weren’t done; our experiment had only just begun. I spun around shortly after overtaking the wyvern and boosted straight back at it.The demidragon squawked in confusion. It had thought that we had chosen to flee, so it never expected us to suddenly come at it, especially with the speed at which we had. And that was effectively the last thing it did. The cold-blooded creature’s life ended the moment we passed it by.I lowered the engine’s output to raise Zaien into position before boosting it back up right as I brought her down on its body, thereby attacking with a weapon that was both a sword and a jet engine simultaneously. The weight of the blow was so heavy that its recoil sent me flying several meters back into the air. And then, right as I was launched, there was an explosion, one accompanied by the fragrant scent of roasted flesh.“What the!?” My attack had proven more powerful than expected. The lizard that had been struck by it had basically erupted. Blood and flesh scattered everywhere. The burning mess that fell to the ground no longer resembled a wyvern. Large chunks of red hot flesh rained onto the forest below, causing tremors and kicking up clouds of dust wherever they landed. Wow uhh… that was a lot stronger than I was expecting it to be. I think I may or may not have just accidentally come up with something ridiculous.Wyverns weren’t all that strong, so killing one in one hit wasn’t really anything to write home about. That said, the attack had done far more than just that. I was certain that it would be able to put a pretty big dent even in monsters of a much higher calibre. The technique that I had just come up with was undoubtedly the type that deserved to be labelled a finishing move, an attack that could break a stalemate and instantly destroy my foes. Yeaaahh, get hit by that, and you’re probably dead. R.I.P.“Master.”
“Yeah?”
“You’re on fire.”
“Huh?” I had a bit of trouble registering Enne’s words at first, but I realized what they meant the moment I looked down. “Oh shit!”The T-shirt I’d gotten from the catalogue was on fire. I immediately started patting it down and managed to save it from degenerating into anything more than just frizzled. I’m guessing I probably got skimmed by a chunk of wyvern or something. God damn, that was one hell of an explosion.A scent reached my nose right as I began to contemplate the random design that the article of clothing featured. Something was still burning, something other than the wyvern’s flesh. Directing my gaze a bit beyond my shirt, and seeing several billowing pillars of black smoke, told me everything I needed to know about its source.“The fuck!?” The trees were on fire. The forest was on fire. Everything was on fire. The wyvern’s scattered bits had ended up sparking a massive bonfire below me. And it was spreading, fast.This wasn’t the first fire I had started today. Nor the second, nor the third, nor the fourth. I had caused more than I could count whilst attempting to master my use of the jet engine. Rir had gone ahead and used his ice magic to put them out each and every single time, so the concept of worrying about starting an uncontrolled burn had effectively slipped my mind. Focusing on my shirt hadn’t exactly helped either. Thanks, Rir, I really don’t know what I’d do without you.Unfortunately, the firefighting wolf was currently nowhere to be found. We had accelerated just a bit too much and left him behind, which meant that this time, I had to clean up my own mess.“Well, Smokey did always say that only I could start forest fires.”
“Smokey?”
“Nah, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it,” I said. God damn it, Yuki. This isn’t the time for that. Stop being dumb and get to work.Still half panicked, I immediately used primordial magic to create an unreasonable amount of water and dumped it on top of the flame. I had thought that it would promptly eliminate the cause of my concern, but apparently, I was wrong. I had only caused even more problems. The combination of the forest fire and the flash flood had shocked the local monsters and caused them to turn tail and start running for their lives. My bad guys. But you know, this is just… another one of them days. The wyvern flying overhead turns into a series of fireballs, and then suddenly a river appears in midair even though there’s barely a cloud in sight. Unfortunate, but totally normal.…Oh who am I kidding? Normal, my ass.Completely flooding the area had managed to remedy the fire problem. The Wicked Forest was no longer in any danger of turning into a giant matchstick. If you could even still call it a forest. The raging tides I had created had toppled about as many trees as they had saved. It was over. But as much as I wanted to heave a sigh of relief, I couldn’t. The day’s problems had only just begun.One of the sounds I found my ears greeted by once the water and fire had both abated was one that sent shivers down my spine: a familiar, insect-like chirping. And there was more than just one. I could hear a countless number of bugs bustling and buzzing about.I slowly turned my head towards the sound’s source, only to find exactly what I had been expecting: a “friendly” reunion with a literal army of ants. We were quite a fair distance from the anthill that Rir and I had retreated from back when I had first encountered the six-legged freaks, which meant that the term reunion wasn’t all that accurate. This group of ants most likely belonged to a different colony than the first. Wait. What the fuck!? Why the hell does this stupid forest have so many fucking ants in it!? Where the hell did these damned things come from anyway!? God damn it! They probably had a god damn community right where I dumped all the water, didn’t they!?The moment the dog-sized insects saw me was the moment they spread their wings and made straight for me.“Nononononono!” The sight of the horde was enough to make me scream like a wimp under extreme duress.While I couldn’t exactly discern an insect’s emotions from its features, I could tell that the ants were angry. The way they flew at me oozed with rage and a thirst for my blood. That “destroyed their anthill” theory is looking pretty accurate right about now.“Mr. Ant sure has lots of friends” said Enne as she watched one of the god-forsaken creatures lead the charge.
“Friends? All I see is a bunch of bloodthirsty maniacs!” I complained.There were way too many of them. I had the sneaking suspicion that they would probably suck every last bit of liquid right out of me and turn me into a mummy the moment they managed to catch me. Not even my bone marrow would be spared. Actually, with jaws that big, they’d probably be more likely to grind up my bones and eat them whole.Another shiver ran up my spine as the disgusting scene before me prompted me to imagine a future I could only label undesirable. I took it as a signal to turn around and immediately begin flying away. A part of me felt as if I could have probably taken the entire army down given my current power level, but I wasn’t about to go through the trouble. I wasn’t about to dirty Enne’s blade with their disgusting body fluids. In fact, I didn’t want to be anywhere near them at all. Both my mind and body had already been conditioned to reject their very existence.The bees Lefi had stolen honey from had been a forced encounter. I only fought them because I hadn’t been able to run away. This scenario was different. The run button wasn’t greyed out this time, so I mashed it with all my might.“A-Alright, Enne,” I stuttered, “let’s show these things just how much we’ve learned today!”
“Okay.”I wrapped Enne’s blade as she activated wind magic. A moment later, we found ourselves launched through the skies. The flames ejected by the maneuver burnt a part of the incoming group to ashes. But of course, it wasn’t anywhere near enough to so much as even stall the tenacious bastards. Those that we hadn’t killed began chasing us with even more vigour, but they soon shrank into tiny dots off in the distance nonetheless.***“Ugh… that was terrible,” I complained as Enne and I finally reached the cave. The ants were fast, so fast that not even Rir could shake them off. Fortunately, our newly labbed techniques had proven that there was no longer any need for us to engage them in a death race. Speaking of Rir, I had used Farspeak in order to dismiss him and tell him that we had already retreated. I had also told him to stop by the cave tomorrow afternoon because there was still something I wanted him to help me with. Today’s farewell had been abrupt, but we would see each other soon. You know, now that I think about it, Rir might just be our dungeon’s hardest worker. I probably need to somehow figure something out as far as overtime pay goes. Wouldn’t want him going on strike.“You seemed to enjoy most of it though, Master.”
“Well, yeah. I can’t say you’re wrong.”Honestly, me enjoying it was probably a big part of the problem. All the fun I had was a major contributor to me getting as carried away as I did. I highly doubted that I would have paid so little attention had I not enjoyed myself. Enne was right, one hundred percent.“I was too.” The sword girl whispered something under her breath, but I couldn’t exactly make out what it was. She was sitting on my shoulders, so I craned my head up in order to look at her.
“Sorry, what? I didn’t catch that.”
“I was having fun being with you too, Master,” she said in an embarrassed whisper.Wow. Enne’s such a good kid. Actually, now that I think about it, all our girls are pretty honest and well behaved. As one of their guardians, I can’t help but be happy that they’re all growing up to be good people.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: An Event in the Throne Room
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“We’re home.”Lefi heard a pair of familiar voices declare their return as she did the usual and lounged around the living room. Technically speaking, the room wasn’t really a living room at all. It was more of a throne room. Functionally speaking, however, describing it as a living room was more than apt; it was a comfortable room in which the dungeon’s residents enjoyed various types of entertainment.The silver-haired dragon directed her gaze towards one of the room’s doors and regarded both the man and the girl that entered through it. The man was the one she had recently declared her mate, a demon lord by the name of Yuki. And riding on his back was a young girl. Zaien, often referred to as Enne, was a blade that fell into a category she knew little about, a so-called katana. Though she was capable of bearing a human form, it housed not her soul. That part of her resided in the weapon that Yuki had in one of his hands.Despite her long life, Lefi had never once heard of a weapon so outrageous. Equally as absurd was her reaction to such a being. Knowing that Yuki was its smith allowed Lefi to accept Enne’s presence as just another normal part of her life despite being a literal walking anomaly. The weapon was not the first bizarre product of Yuki’s actions and she would surely not be the last. Knowing this dulled Lefi’s senses; spending her days around her husband and his eccentricities had desensitized the dragon to the abnormal.He was an odd man, but that too was, at least in her eyes, a part of his charm. She felt as if his peculiarities had played a large role in drawing her to him, for she had never even considered the possibility of taking a mate prior to his arrival in spite of the length of her life.The days she had spent without him were dull, boring, and lifeless. But now, each and every single day was bursting with colour, filled to the brim with excitement and joy she had never before known. He had changed her world. He had shown her how much she hadn’t known, just how fun life could be.If she had never met him, then she would still be up on that mountain of hers, quietly idling her days away. The wonderful things that she now experienced each day would have remained forever unknown. It was a terrifying thought, one that sent shivers down her spine. Lefi knew that she had been spoiled. It was no longer possible for her to go back to living the way she had before. Such a life was far too dull for her now that she had grown to know a taste other than monotony.“Welcome home.” She set her thoughts aside as she spoke to the black haired pair in a tone of voice that contained a hint of amazement. “I must ask you this, Yuki, why is it that you have yet again returned in such a ragged state?”Though he was just a fraction of Lefi’s age, Yuki’s form appeared to indicate that he was an adult, but he returned in a state in which one would only expect of a child. His clothes were torn, he was covered in mud, and there was even a trace of an odd scent on him. It was almost as if he had been burnt. The girl on his shoulders was completely untouched, a fact that only made his messy state stand out all the more.She would have understood if it happened to be the result of engaging monsters in combat, but that was not the only scenario in which Yuki would return in such a state. The same would often happen if he were to accompany the children on some sort of outing. Thus, she came to the conclusion that Yuki himself just happened to be rather childish.Thinking about his lack of maturity eventually led Lefi to recall that he had only been born rather recently. He had mentioned that he had only become a demon lord almost immediately prior to their first encounter. In other words, he was less than a year old, which meant it only made sense for him to be childish. However, no matter how she looked, Lefi could only come to the conclusion that his body was as mature as that of any adult’s. The stark contrast prompted a thought, I understand not the biology of a demon lord. How strange their life cycles are.“Y-Yeah, uh, you know, things happened…” said Yuki.
“Master had fun with a new type of magic.”
“Enne, please! You can’t just rat me out like that!”Yuki had tried to play the reason for his current state off as something outside his control, but the expressionless girl revealed the truth before he had much of a chance to hide it. The sword’s explanation made everything click. Lefi could easily imagine the demon lord enjoying himself as he attempted to fiddle with his new “toy.” She didn’t have much to say about the situation, and it showed on her face; the scene that played out in her head caused her to put on an expression containing a mix of amusement and exasperation.“Welcome home, My Lord,” said Leila. The sheep-horned demon had noticed that the master of the house had returned, so she stuck her head out from the kitchen in order to greet him.
“Thanks Leila,” said Yuki with a cough. “Is dinner ready yet?”
“It won’t be too long now, My Lord,” said Leila. She took a good look at him and confirmed that he was covered from head to toe with dirt before speaking up again. “Might I suggest you take a bath while you wait? There should be enough time for you to get in and out before dinner is ready.”
“Might as well.” He paused for a moment to look at Zaien, who had gotten off his shoulders and started tugging on the hem of his shirt. She wasn’t saying anything, but Yuki immediately seemed to understand what she wanted. “What about you, Enne? You want to get in too?”
“Yes please.”
“Well, that’s that settled. Where are the rest of the girls, Leila?”
“They should be coming back from the castle soon. I’m fairly certain that they will also be covered in mud, so they will probably end up joining you soon.”
“Aye aye, Captain.”Yuki waved Lefi and Leila goodbye, spun the doorknob a few times, and left alongside the girl he had returned with. It appeared that he had chosen to head towards the larger bath he had constructed in the plains as opposed to the smaller one in the throne room because he knew that the girls would be joining him.The door he used was an item that manipulated spacetime through the use of magic in order to connect different areas, and its knob functioned as the controller that specified which.“I must admit, he is quite skilled with regards to the handling of children,” said Lefi.
“A wonderful trait for a husband to have, isn’t it?” chuckled Leila.The maid’s words made Lefi flush. Hearing someone else call Yuki her husband really made their newfound status as a couple hit home. Though some time had passed since the change, thinking about it still brought a blush to Lefi’s cheeks.“Gentlemen that are good at looking after the needs of others are quite difficult to come by, and he also appears to be rather strong.” said Leila. “I think that you have caught yourself a good man, Lefi.”Though Leila was far detached from the stereotypical demon, she still possessed some of their values. Thus, to her, strength was an important aspect that could drastically add or detract from a man’s appeal.“I have no intention of yielding him to you,” said Lefi, narrowing her gaze.
“I’m well aware,” replied Leila with another chuckle.The pair’s conversation came to an abrupt end as a panicked, distressed voice suddenly came from within the kitchen.“L-Leila, I think somethin’s wrong! The pot’s foamin’ and lookin’ real bad!”
“Well, Lefi, it looks like I have to get back to work,” sighed Leila. “Dinner will be ready in about half an hour. Please do your best not to fall asleep again before we start.”
“That I shall,” said Lefi. “And I ask that you seek my help should the need arise, for Yuki will be quite angry should I merely continue to laze about.”
“Then I suppose I’ll be taking you up on that offer shortly,” said Leila with a smile before heading back into the kitchen while muttering under her breath. “Geez. What is it this time, Lyuu? All I asked you to do was watch the pot…”And then, the living room was filled with silence, a silence that would only last until everyone returned. Lefi knew that her surroundings would soon be bustling with noise. In fact, she could very easily picture the exact scene and sequence of events. Yuki would return with the children in tow, Lyuu would act as flustered as usual while setting the table while Leila quickly put the final touches on the meal from right beside her. Once everything was in place, everyone would put their hands together and say grace in a manner introduced by Yuki before noisily discussing the day’s events.The canvas she laid out in her mind caused her to chuckle and think to herself that she finally knew fortune. She would soon be surrounded by laughter, joy, and warmth. She would soon be surrounded by the very elements that composed the beauty of life.A small smile appeared on Lefi’s lips. For though she was alone now, she would soon be surrounded by those that she loved.<– Prev — Next –>

Enhancing the Dungeon’s Defenses — Phase Two: Acquiring New Subordinates
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“There you are.” I waved at Rir as he emerged from the forest. The wolf had done as ordered and visited the dungeon the day after I almost accidentally committed the felony known as arson.He returned my greeting with a bark, so I did as any pet owner would and started playing around with his fur. Oh man, this stuff feels great. I remember sleeping in it when we were coming back from the capital. As far as pillows go, Rir’s second only to Lefi. Fur is love, fur is life, and anyone that says otherwise is wrong.“Oh yeah, right, I just realized I totally forgot to mention why I wanted you to come over today.” Only after playing with Rir’s fur to my heart’s content did I finally get down to business. “I was finally going to get around to getting the dungeon a few new hires. I’m going to be counting on you to show them the ropes, alright?”My canine friend nodded, so I reluctantly took my hands off his fur and opened up the menu. Today was the first time I would increase the number of monsters the dungeon had since the time I summoned the three wraith girls. I had been thinking about it for quite some time, but I kept putting it off. Until today.Procrastination wasn’t without its benefits. Not choosing immediately provided me with a long period of time to contemplate the many different possibilities I had to pick from. I was long locked in; I knew exactly what I wanted and why. Heh. Summoning these four is basically going to double our forces. It’ll take me one step closer to making my dungeon the most absurdly difficult dungeon that there ever was.“Now come, my pets! Heed your new owner’s summons!”I popped open the dungeon catalogue, scrolled over to where the monsters were listed, and selected the four that I had marked in advance. My vision was suddenly flooded by a vast number of glowing particles the moment I hit the confirm button. The literal bundles of light began to gather and settle, forming four silhouettes before slowly melding away and revealing the creatures they had created.The first was a crimson snake covered from head to toe with beautiful, glossy scales. The second was a jet black bird with a sharp glint in its eyes. The third was a white cat with a forked tail and sleek white fur. And the last was a blob of water that floated about in the air. Their species were Giant Blood Serpent, Dark Crow, Demonic Cat, and Water Spirit respectively. The spirit was a bit smaller than me, but the crow and the cat were both as big as Rir. The snake was even bigger. It was so large that it could swallow me whole with ease. In fact, it was so large that I wouldn’t be surprised if it proved itself capable of devouring Rir. Whew. Thankfully, none of them turned out to be little girls this time. I would’ve been in for a baaaad time.Most of their stats sat around somewhere in the six hundred range, with health and mana as the exceptions. Their HP values varied between one and a half and two thousand, while their mana values sat at about double that. Of course, as each of the monsters belonged to a different species, they didn’t actually share stat distributions. They all had their own unique splits, but overall, their numbers were indicative of the fact that they were all just about equally valuable in a fight.The catalogue labelled all four as monsters with high potential. Their final evolutions fell in the same tier as those classified as legendary or mythical. I think the proper term for them was supposed to be Calamity Class or something like that.In fact, their final evolutions were so powerful that some had even caused Lefi a great deal of trouble in the past. Heh. Raising and training them is gunna be fun. Soon, I’ll have myself the most powerful monster-based military that this world has to offer. Heh. I can’t wait.“Listen up, maggots. The name’s Yuki, and I’m your new boss.”Hearing my words caused all four of my new pets to bow their heads. Sweet. It looks like they’re all already nice and obedient.“Alright, now I’m going to name you. From left to right, it’s going to be Orochi, Yata, Byakku, and Wsprit.”I quickly analyzed them in order to confirm that the right names had applied to the right monsters. Summarizing the results produced the following:***
Pet #1
Name: Orochi
Race: Giant Blood Serpent
Unique Skill: Poison FangPet #2
Name: Yata
Race: Dark Crow
Unique Skill: FarsightPet #3
Name: Byakku
Race: Demonic Cat
Unique Skill: IllusionPet #4
Name: Wsprit
Race: Water Spirit
Unique Skill: Current Control***Looking them over once again prompted me to think that, Wsprit aside, they were absolutely massive. And yet, they remained obedient. The way they were listening to me almost made me think that they were kind of cute. Yup. Ain’t nothing out there as cute as an obedient pet.Size wasn’t the only thing that made the water spirit stand out amongst its peers. There were two types of spirits. The first was well, actual spirits, whereas the second was a group of non-spiritual monsters referred to as spirits. Wsprit fell in the latter category and thus was not technically an actual spirit. Yeah, confusing, I know.“I want you guys to live in the forest around these parts. Your job will be to hunt monsters. Be careful though, the monsters around here are pretty tough, and there are traps all over the place. Let Rir over here know if you run into any problems or need help. He’s been around for a while, and he’ll be showing you the ropes.” I gave the reliable wolf a pat on the back. “Well, Rir, it’s all you now. Good luck getting them up to par.”Oh man, I am one shitty boss. I basically just piled all my work on him without even bothering to help. In my defence, Rir’s probably a better fighter than me anyway. I’d probably only get in his way even if I did try helping. More importantly, the canine seemed quite interested in the task. It seemed like something that he knew he would enjoy. Well, I’ll check in every once in a while, but otherwise, I guess I’ll just leave you to it.Rir had turned out pretty strong himself. Analyzing him produced the following results:***

I was pretty sure that our numbers would be about equal once he caught up to me even though both the dungeon’s growth and my evolution had boosted my stats. Goddamn, Rir, you’re a man.His skills had levelled up since I last saw him, and he’d even gained two that I didn’t recall him having, Fang Mastery and Command. He probably got Command from issuing orders to all his underlings, huh?He’d also gained a few titles, King of the Monsters, and Worn Out Wolf. Wait, Worn Out Wolf? Lemme analyze that real quick.***
Worn Out Wolf: A title granted to a wolf that has developed pessimistic tendencies as a result of spending each day stressing out and worrying due to pressure from both his underlings and his superiors.

Playing With Pets
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerLooking at Rir’s new title made me grimace. The poor wolf had been through so much that the world itself had deemed him worthy of being labelled as worn out.“Sorry, Rir.” I gently pat the pitiable canine on the back as I spoke. “I didn’t know you had it that hard.”My actions prompted him to whine in confusion and give me a bewildered look. Sorry man, I’ll try to treat you better from now on. I’m sorry for being such a shitty owner.I continued to lament his suffering for a while but stopped as I heard a pair of footsteps approach me from the rear. Turning around, I saw Illuna and Lefi strolling over, hand in hand. What a sight for sore eyes. “There you are!” The vampire let go of the dragon’s hand and dashed right at me, so I scooped her up in a hug.
“What’s up, girls?”
“Illuna wished to visit the outdoors and interact with our new pets,” said Lefi. “My purpose is that of an escort. I am accompanying her to ensure her safety.”The terms outdoors and outside, when used by members of our household, typically meant anything that lay beyond the cave. One of the house’s rules was that the kids weren’t allowed to go outside unsupervised. It was too dangerous. Illuna had been kidnapped once already and we didn’t need a repeat. Any kid that wanted to play outside would have to be accompanied by an adult.Though it may have seemed like it, the supervision requirement didn’t prove to be much of an issue. The grasslands were vast. As far as the kids were concerned, playing in the plains was functionally equivalent to playing outdoors already, so chaperoned excursions were rare.“Thanks for bringing her, Lefi,” I said. “Looks like you’ve become quite the respectable guardian, huh?”
“I see not how my capacity as a guardian is indicative of change,” she replied. “Have I have not always watched over you and your childish antics?”
“Childish antics? That’s real rich coming from you.” I rolled my eyes.As far as I was concerned, I was the one looking after her. But with that said, Lefi had proven that she was actually a decent caretaker. She was great at looking after the kids, and they all seemed fairly attached to her. And as of late, she had even started doing housework.“Lefi sure does make for a pretty great wife.”
“W-What is this all of a sudden!?”
“Huh?” I paused for a second. “Oh, whoops. I didn’t mean to say that out loud.”
“I fail to follow! I understand not how you could have possibly derived that thought from the topic at hand!” shouted Lefi with her face red as a tomato. Ermahgerd. This woman be adorable.
“Don’t worry too much about it,” I said. “Anyway, how about you take a look at our new pets?”Lefi sensed my desire to change the topic and hopped all aboard. She “cleared her throat” by faking a cough before beginning to speak.“I assume they are of the species we discussed?”
“Pretty much, yeah. I grabbed a bunch of pre-evolutions based on the stuff you told me you had trouble with,” I said. “Er, kinda. There’s one that doesn’t fit into that category, but I’m pretty confident it’ll end up just as strong.”Byakku was a demonic cat, a creature that stemmed from Japanese folklore. I was pretty sure that Lefi didn’t know about it, and that I was only able to summon it because my memories had carried over. The dungeon’s catalogue had mentioned that it had excellent potential for growth, and its final evolution was a master of illusion. It was going to be extremely powerful. I just knew it. I can totally imagine it saying “Amaterasu,” and creating a bunch of black flames that can’t be put out.“I expected you to procure yet another young maiden,” said Lefi. “I am relieved to see that you have proven me wrong.”
“Yeaaaah… I was pretty worried that’d happen too,” I said with a grimace. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve already hit the cap on the little girl count. There’s already way too many for me to handle. Adding to their number just sounds like a recipe for disaster. Let’s not.Illuna approached the group of four monsters with her eyes sparkling as Lefi and I talked.“Wow! They’re all so big!” Her voice was filled with naught but energy. There wasn’t a speck of fear to be found no matter how hard I listened. “Nice to meet you everyone! I’m Illuna!”The monsters’ reactions could be categorized into two groups. The first group consisted of the guys, Orochi and Yata. Both the snake and the crow seemed somewhat unsettled. They had no idea what they were supposed to do with the child that had suddenly popped up in front of them. Byakku and Wsprit, on the other hand, reacted more amicably. The cat approached Illuna and rubbed her face against the young vampire’s affectionately. Likewise, the water spirit also approached while happily bobbing around in the air.Though I quite literally only just summoned them, I was already starting to get a grasp on their individual personalities. The guys seemed straight-laced. The girls, on the other hand, were much more friendly and open. Er, wait. Right. Wsprit is genderless, isn’t it? There goes that hypothesis. Well, either way, sorry Orochi, Yata, but as members of this household, you guys are going to have to learn a thing or two about dealing with kids. You’re probably going to find yourselves swarmed by them sooner or later. Just calling it out ahead of time.Sooner appeared to be the word of the day, as Illuna’s interest immediately shifted to Orochi the moment she was done playing with Byakku and her fur. She approached the massive serpent and started running her hands across the bright red scales that covered the surface of his body.“Wow! Your scales are so sleek and shiny!”Orochi had no idea what to do. He desperately looked around at everyone present as if to beg for advice. Noticing his plight, Byakku heaved a bit of a sigh before turning towards him and meowing in a catlike manner. The only difference between the noise she made and a regular meow was that hers was a bit deeper and more elongated. After acknowledging his coworker’s advice with a nod, Orochi dropped his head to ground level and put it right in front of Illuna.“Are you… letting me on?”The snake hissed in affirmation.“Yay! Thanks!” Illuna’s eyes sparkled all the more as she happily climbed on his head. The Giant Blood Serpent slowly craned his head back up and raised her into the sky. “Wow! It’s so high up here! I can see everything!”The newfound view had her almost screaming in joy and excitement.“You know, I’ve been thinking this for some time now, but Illuna’s pretty damn brave, isn’t she?” I said. “She really doesn’t seem to be afraid of much of anything at all.”Normal kids would be terrified of being that high up. And that’s completely disregarding the giant ass, mean-looking snake. I’m pretty sure most people would start running the moment they saw him. Dude’s terrifying. Is this just a kid thing? Like, is she just not scared because she doesn’t really understand what he can do to her? Or is it more of an Illuna thing?“I believe that there are two contributors to her lack of fear,” said Lefi. “The first is that you have labelled the creatures as pets. And the second is she takes after none other than yourself.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” I turned towards the girl I’d put a ring on just in time to see her shrug.
“She bears your stupidity, Yuki. I suppose that you may also label it bravery if that is what you wish,” said Lefi. “For few have the gall to challenge a member of this world’s most powerful race to single combat.”
“Oh, stop it, you. You’re making me blush.”
“Offering praise was not by any means my intention,” said Lefi. “But whatever the case, her audacity bears a striking resemblance to your own.”
“Huh…” I couldn’t help but smile. “I guess you’re right. She really did get that from me, didn’t she?”
“Tell me, Yuki. Why is it that you have reacted with a display of satisfaction?” said Lefi, exasperated.
“Y-you would too if you were in my shoes,” I stuttered. “It just feels good to know that she’s so comfortable around me that she’s started picking up my habits. Really makes me feel like I’ve done a good job as her guardian.”
“I suppose I would…” said Lefi. “The argument that you have made is one I cannot deny.”
“See? I knew you’d get it.”
“Yuki! Lefi! Look! I’m flying!”I would have continued looking at and speaking to the dragon, but Illuna called for the two of us, so I turned my head back in her direction instead. And as I did, I discovered that she was no longer on Orochi’s head. She had moved over to Yata’s back instead. The two were flying around the nearby skies.“Uhhh… I-I’m not so sure that’s okay…” I struggled a bit to put my words together as I watched the two go. “I don’t even want to imagine what’d happen if she fell.”
“Take to the skies, Yuki. Spread your wings and accompany that bird of yours. I shall remain beneath them should the worst occur,” said Lefi. “I shall have you grill that bird and make it tonight’s dinner should he dare drop her.”
“Yeah uh… so I think I’m going to pass on the grilling part,” I said. I did just get him after all. Can’t be that strict with my new hires. R-right?And so, Lefi and I spent the rest of the day drowned in worry as Illuna found all sorts of ways to play with our new pets.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: ???
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerMy chest heaved up and down as my lungs fought to keep up with my body’s demand for oxygen. Most of the life-sustaining element was routed to my legs in order to allow me to continue pedalling my bike at full speed.“It would be best for you to accelerate, Yuki, for we are sure to be late for school should you continue at such a leisurely pace,” Lefi spoke in a laid-back tone as she continued to do nothing to help. If anything, the lazy slob was actively making the task at hand more difficult by remaining seated atop the man-powered vehicle’s rear cargo rack.
“Oh, shut up! Whose fault do you think that is in the first place!?”
“Hmph.” She snorted as if to offhandedly dismiss my reproachful flare-up. “I see no reason for you to pin the blame on any other but yourself.”
“Are you serious!? You’re telling me that!? You were the one that overslept and took your sweet ass time eating breakfast! You even refused to budge until you were done, even though you could’ve totally just taken part of it with you! This is literally all your fault!”The girl, who was clad in a traditional Japanese outfit not unlike the type one would see on a samurai, averted her gaze. She was fully aware of the fact that she was ultimately the reason why I’d been forced into pedalling as hard as I was. There was no way she wasn’t. She had quite literally ignored the many time-related protests I’d voiced while she worked through her breakfast at a snail’s pace.What angered me most about this situation wasn’t that she had failed to verbally acknowledge that it was her fault, but rather that she relaxed even while I was stuck putting every last bit of effort I had into maintaining my top speed in spite of it being her fault.“Weren’t you supposed to be one of the Sanctified? How about you do something about this then? Speed up the bike or something.”
“I cannot,” she said. “And I see no reason for you to expect me to possess a power so convenient for the situation at hand.”
“Goddamn useless piece of junk.” I clicked my tongue as I made the remark.
“How dare you!?” She continued on with a variety of phrases, including, “Take that back immediately!” and “I am most certainly not useless!” but I ignored them in favour of focusing on pedalling and pedalling alone.***“Holy shit… I can’t believe… we.. actually made… it…” I barely panted out a sentence as I dragged my way over to my desk and collapsed in my seat.
“Good morning, Yuki,” said the person seated beside me. “It looks like you’re right on time.”She was a familiar face, one decorated with a head of short, chocolatey brown hair. The tomboy was one that somehow retained an aura of sportiness despite wearing the exact same uniform as everyone else. At her feet lay a wolf with a pretty silver coat. You could tell from the manner in which he carried himself that he was much more intelligent than your everyday canine companion.“Morning Nell, and you too Rir,” I greeted the pair as soon as I managed to catch my breath. “And yeah, you can blame that on Lefi. She overslept. Again.” I sighed. “That damned familiar of mine is just about everything an early riser isn’t.”Fluffrir raised his head and greeted me with a bit of a nod. See what I mean? He’s smart AND adorable. Meanwhile, Lefi’s basically just a hunk of garbage. If only we could trade…“Is she in the library again?” said Nell, after stifling a giggle.
“Yup. She started complaining about class being boring and whatnot, so she went off to do whatever,” I grumbled. “Why the hell is she able to be off doing whatever the hell she wants anyway? Isn’t she supposed to be my familiar?”Familiars were, under normal circumstances, unable to stray too far from their summoners. Lefi’s ability to wander wherever her heart desired was one that defied common sense. Man, I’m jealous. Why the hell is she the only one that gets to skip and do whatever? I want to ditch class and laze around like a degenerate too.Unfortunately, my desire was one that was off the menu. My homeroom teacher was so keen on ensuring that his students’ remained in line that he developed a tendency to administer punishments that bordered on being demonic. If I were to skip, then he was sure to use “guidance counselling” as an excuse to make me do an inhuman number of laps around the school’s campus. I knew that the experience would leave me mentally crippled and that I’d never want to move again once he was done with me, so I bore with my frustrations for the time being. That wasn’t to say that I wouldn’t get my revenge, or that Lefi wouldn’t suffer. I just needed time. Heh. Just you wait, Lefi. When we get home, I’ll crush you so hard in Smash you’ll start crying.“It must be nice to have a familiar that can play games with you.” Explaining my revenge plot to Nell prompted her to respond in an envious tone. “I’d love to do that with Rir, but that doesn’t really seem like it’d work.”The wolf whined, in part to apologize, and in part to ask its master not to request the impossible. Random tangent, but Nell seems to think I’ve got the aura of an older brother even though we’re literally the same age. I don’t really get it, but whatever.“You sure? Rir seems pretty smart, so I’m sure you could probably teach him to use a joystick by scrunching up his paws.”
“Oh, good idea! I think that might work. Do you mind if we try it when we get home, Rir?”The wolf whined again, seemingly because he was startled by the suggestion.As much as I wanted to keep talking, I couldn’t. The conversation was put to a swift end by the morning bell.“Shit. Looks like the teacher’s here. I’m going to shut up for a bit.”
“Mhm, good idea. He does seem to be keeping a close eye on you, after all.”***Familiars were considered a common sight. They were quite literally all over the place, and one could expect to see them wherever humans made their mark. They were multifaceted in their purposes, and all in all, served as an integral part of both society and the world at large. Those who possessed familiars were known as summoners, and they too had become not only accepted but also relied upon. Even the military found itself dependent on summoners. One of its most elite branches, one specialized in the capture of fugitives, was composed entirely of summoner-familiar pairs.Though the term familiar often brought to mind the image of a servant. And the otherworldly creatures certainly did find themselves bound to their summoners by contract, they were by no means mere tools. Their contracts were not set in stone. They were free to dissolve their agreements at any point in time and return to The Other Realm, the world from which they came. Termination was not the only choice they had either. Familiars could easily ignore or overturn any undesired orders by making use of their powers, powers known as Hallow Authorities.Naturally, this was not the norm, but rather the exception, and only had the tendency to occur in the case that the summoner decided to act in a manner that resembled a bona fide piece of shit. Generally speaking, familiars trusted their contractors and would heed their orders or make their own intelligent judgements if necessary. Keyword: intelligent. Familiars were typically considered incredibly wise. Typically.“So why, exactly, am I stuck with someone like this…?” I sighed as I eyed the girl beside me.
“Curses!” Lefi shouted in a vehement display of frustration as she attempted to manipulate an on-screen character with the controller she had in hand.I couldn’t see her as a familiar. She lacked all of the necessary wisdom and intelligence that her kind was known to display. Interacting with her felt more like interacting with a spoiled brat than it did some sort of sagacious otherworldly being. And despite being bound to me by contract, she effectively never listened to anything I said.Speaking of her contract, the terms of it were grounds for suspicion. They stated that she would be given three warm meals a day and a soft, comfortable bed. These terms, while seemingly harmless, were in part a manifestation of her sloth. Lefi had stated that she was considered amongst The Other Realm’s more powerful entities and that she had chosen the terms she had because she wished to grant me even greater power. The reasoning behind that statement was that she felt I had potential because I had apparently proven myself “powerful enough to summon her.”In truth, however, she had simply been desperate for a way to secure herself an infinite number of free lunches. And breakfasts. And dinners. I was told by the other familiars that, while she certainly was considered a being of great power, she had been kicked out of her old home for being a lazy slob. After this incident, she concocted a plan to secure herself a new source of sustenance and put it into action when I conducted the summoning ritual as a part of the standard school curriculum.“Annnnd… see ya.”
“C-curse you, Yuki! You are not playing fair! Did I not just declare that you were no longer allowed to spike me off the stage!?”We were in the middle of a game of Super Smash Sisters. Lefi had attempted to make her way back onto the stage, but I had denied her the opportunity by sinking her like the titanic right as she was about to grab the ledge. The sequence of events had caused her to fly into a fit of rage.“Say what you want, but that’s literally how the game was meant to be played. Git gud,” I said. “But I mean, we can turn up the handicap settings if you’re really feeling desperate.”
She groaned in frustration and indignance before starting to speak. “There is little reason for you to act with such conceit, for you have only taken one of my lives. Just you wait, Yuki, I shall immediately proceed to drag your face through the mud!”
“Hah!” I scoffed. “You wish! It’ll take you more than a lifetime to get good enough to beat me. Now get over here, I’ll show you why they call me a Zeldia main—and the Dunkmaster!”I took my eyes off the screen to flash her a grin, which only led to even more frustrated grumbling. But then she almost seemed to realize something. Her frown turned a full 180 degrees as she chanted a few select words under her breath.“…I seek for all that stands to reason to be cast in shadow.”
“W-what!? The fuck is going on!?” Everything went dark. My vision had been replaced with nothingness.I could feel the controller vibrating as my character was punished over and over. And I could hear Zeldia scream as she was sent flying out of the arena. But without my ability to see, there was nothing I could do but mash.“Son of a bitch! Did you just use your fucking Hallow Authority!?”
“Hahahahahah!” She laughed triumphantly. “What is the matter, Yuki? You appear to be struggling with the game’s controls.”
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me!” I screamed, infuriated. “You refused to do this shit when I was about to be late for school, but then you decide to use it just because you’re getting your ass beat in a video game!? For fucks sake! Just how petty are you!?”
“I fail to see the point you have attempted to make. This game is competitive. It involves making full use of one’s might to stand atop one’s foe as the victor. My Hallow Authority is merely an extension of my inherent ability!” She mashed her controller’s buttons furiously as she continued to rant. “And now, you are finished! This will be the final blow!”My vision was restored as suddenly as it was removed. I was finally able to see again. But it was too late. The last I saw of my character was a light pink streak as she flew off the screen and into the abyss. I had started with three stocks when Lefi first threw the concept of fairness out the window, but now, I had none.“Are you serious!? You literally stole all my lives with that bullshit!? Fine, you know what, if you wanna play like that, we can fucking play like that! I was holding back since I felt bad for you, but if you’re just going to cheat, then the gloves are coming right the hell off!”
“There is no use in acting tough, Yuki.” She laughed slowly, deliberately, before continuing. “But now that I have begun to unleash the full extent of my power, I can no longer know defeat!”
“You wish! If you think that’s power, then I’ll just have to show you what true power looks like!”With our intentions declared, we selected our characters and moved on to the next round.Lefi began to chant the moment the game said: “Go.”But I cut her off before she could finish it. “I’m going to take away a part of your dinner each time you try to use your Hallow Authority.”The threat, though whispered in a quiet tone, had proven effective. It prompted my familiar to immediately turn towards me with an expression that bordered on horror.“W-what!? T-that is far from fair, Yuki! You could not possibly be so cruel!”
“Weren’t you the one that just said games are about using everything at your disposal?” I said. “You see, it just so happens that I’m in charge of making your dinner, which means I have a very, very clear weakness to exploit, don’t it?”
“Y-you scoundrel…”She clenched her teeth and glared at me, but my triumphant smile failed to waver, let alone fade.“So, how about we get back to round two?”***“Mmmnnngh…” I groaned as I slowly opened my eyes. I found myself greeted not by a console and a TV, but rather, an environment I’d grown far more used to over the course of the past few months.It was the dungeon.Each of the adults seemed to be doing their own thing, as usual. Lyuu was off playing house with the kids in one corner of the true throne room. Leila was folding the laundry, and Lefi was seated in front of a shogi board. Based on how the pieces were positioned, it seemed as if she was playing a one dragon game.“Have you finally awoken, Yuki?” She noticed me stir, so she raised her head from its previous position and turned her eyes towards me.
“Yeah… Looks like I must’ve passed out or something.”I realized, after a bit of blinking, that I had fallen asleep atop the throne. So does that mean that was all just a dream…?“What is the matter?” asked the dragon. “You appear to be bearing quite the silly expression.”
“Bit of a random thought, but do you think it’s possible you’d ever end up as my familiar?”
“I am not sure exactly what it is you are trying to say, or where any of this is coming from,” she said as she raised an eyebrow in suspicion.
“Yeah, nevermind, don’t worry about it.” I dismissed the idea with a bit of a dry smile.
“…You certainly can be quite the oddball.”She gave me another confused look, but I shrugged it off as I delved back into my thoughts.Lefi wasn’t my familiar. Or anything even remotely like it. She, Leficios, was the Supreme Dragon, the legendary almighty being of which this world’s legends were sung. She was, at one point, one of this dungeon’s freeloaders, but she had since then undergone a change in her status. She had become a member of my family in the truest sense. My wife.But, instinctively, I knew. I knew that, even in some far off parallel world, the relationship she and I shared wouldn’t truly change, that we would continue to fight over the silliest of things as we dicked around and spent our days together, the same way we had in my dream. Though I hadn’t seen them in the dream world, I suspected that the rest of the dungeon’s residents must have inhabited it as well. And that they were also in my immediate vicinity. Chances were, they probably live next door and come over for games and stuff on the weekends. I mean, all that’s just speculation, but my gut’s saying that that’s probably exactly how it would’ve all played out. Man, that parallel universe sure sounds like a fun one.I caught myself breaking into laughter after a few moments of contemplation. Yeah, that sounds about right. Lefi and I would still be together. Even in another world.“What is it, Yuki? Why are you regarding me with such interest?”
“Nah, it’s nothing,” I said. “Anyway, looks like you’re playing by yourself? How about I step up to the plate and join you?”
“Very well, let us engage each other in a duel of wits, for today marks the day that I shall finally bring you to tears.”
“Bring me to tears, eh?” I chuckled.As opposed to dragging my face through the mud like other Lefi, huh?“Why is it that you are laughing?”
“No reason. Just, you know, doubting that you’d be able to pull it off.”
“How insolent!” she humphed. “I have not put in so much practice for nothing! But very well, let us see which of us arises as the winner. You will regret underestimating me!”
“You literally say that every time,” I sighed in an over-exaggerated manner as I got off the throne and sat down across from her. “But nothing ever changes.”And then, just like the other me, I spent another day by Lefi’s side.***(APRIL FOOL’S 2020) TL Note: As Cardboard Translations is not an essential service, we will be temporarily shutting down for the duration of the government lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Messenger — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerI was situated on the throne, kicked back and relaxed in pretty much the exact same way as usual when my map suddenly popped up out of nowhere. There was a fresh red blinker on it, one that indicated the presence of an intruder. It was our first human-shaped intruder in a long while, and for a moment, I had almost thought that Nell had finally decided to drop by. But alas, that wasn’t the case. Nell was marked as friendly; she would have shown up on the map as a blue dot instead.By tapping the blinker, I checked the intruder’s stats.***
Name: Haloria Laylott
Race: Guardian Devil
Class: Agent of the Demon Realm’s Secret Service
Level: 54
***Oh? It looks like he’s a demon. My overall assessment was that the intruder was pretty strong. He was level 54 and his stats were pretty decent. He was about the same strength as the knight chick I met in the capital, Carlotta. Makes sense, given his class. The Demon Realm’s Secret Service sounds pretty important. You’d probably need to be at least kinda strong to actually make it in.“But why would anyone that’s a part of the secret service be all the way out here?” I muttered to myself as I continued to observe the agent through the feed I was getting from my evil eyes. I could tell that he was a winged demon given that he was literally flying around. He had a hood over his face so I couldn’t actually see it, but I could still tell that he was actively scanning his surroundings. It seemed like he was looking for something. The only things all the way out here are me, my dungeon, and everyone that lives in it. Well, aside from monsters, anyway.“Hey Leila, do you know anything about the Demon Realm’s Secret Service?” I looked over at the maid, who happened to be working nearby, as I asked a question I figured she’d probably know the answer to.
“The Demon Realm’s Secret Service? I believe that they serve the lord of the demons, the king that rules over demonkind,” she replied. “They’re effectively intelligence operatives. Most of their work is rather questionable and consists of tasks like espionage and plotting conspiracies.”
“Hmmm… alright. Thanks,” I said. Alright, so basically they do exactly what you’d expect. Go figure. I wonder if this guy’s somehow related to the fiend I beat up back in the capital.
“What prompted the question, My Lord?”
“Well, it kinda looks like we’ve got one wandering around the property.”
“Did you perhaps do something to garner their attention?”
“Honestly? Probably, yeah. I can’t really say I don’t have anything in mind,” I said. I did kinda leave that one guy completely armless, after all.
“My Lord, might I suggest attempting to resolve the situation amicably? Attacking the agent may open up the possibility of turning the king’s faction hostile.”
“Yeah, I get it,” I said. “Though, I think it might already be a bit too late for that. We’ll see.”As I didn’t know much about the intruder or their intentions, I wasn’t planning on running at them guns blazing right off the bat. There was no need to act in such an aggressive manner. Unless I know they’ve got it out for me, of course.“Sorry Enne, but I’m going to need you to come with me for a bit.”
“Okay.” She quickly got rid of her human form and returned to being just a weapon.I slung her over my shoulder and got moving after using Farspeak to instruct Rir not to bother the intruder, as he had just so happened to detect him right as I finished getting ready to go.***“Hey.” I called out to Agent Hoodie McHoodface after popping stealth and sneaking behind him. “You looking for someone? You’ve been wandering around for a while now.”Startled, he immediately spun around and drew the dagger he had at his waist. But he was too late. I had Enne situated right by the side of his neck. “Try anything and I’ll take your head clean off.”He first reacted to the threat by stiffening up, but soon dropped his weapon and let it fall into the forest below before starting to speak.“Are you Yuki?” Though the agent had yet to loosen up, she still spoke in a clear unwavering tone. “I’m looking for the demon lord that resolved the problem created in the Kingdom’s capital by one of the fiend faction’s agents.”Huh. Didn’t think he’d, er, she’d be a chick. Listening to her speak had made me realize something. She had intentionally phrased the statement in a way that implied she wasn’t affiliated with the guy that I had almost turned into a winged nugget.“I’ll leave that up to your imagination,” I said. “So, what would you do if I turned out to be the guy you’re looking for?”
“Talk,” she said. “I would try to initiate a dialogue. We share a common foe, so I thought we might be able to help each other.”Hmmm… it doesn’t seem like she’s lying. The map displayed her as an enemy, mainly because that was just how it displayed all trespassers. I had to go ahead and manually mark people I considered friendly. But while the dungeon’s UI told me that I should probably consider her hostile, Enemy Detection claimed the exact opposite. The skill wasn’t reacting. It wasn’t telling me that she wanted to kill or harm me. Moreover, the demon only seemed to be as on guard as anyone meeting someone new would be, which was to say she wasn’t all that on guard at all.There were still a few things I wasn’t all that sure about, but whatever the case, it didn’t seem like she’d be jumping at me the moment she was no longer at risk of losing her head, so I pulled Enne away from her neck and hoisted the blade back over my shoulder.“And what exactly would this Yuki person stand to gain from talking to you?”
“We’re offering two things,” she said. “The first is information. We’ll provide intel regarding his enemy’s plans. The second is an alliance with a group he shares an enemy with.”
“Hmmm….” I narrowed my eyes as I contemplated her proposition. “I guess that makes you one of the king’s messengers or something, doesn’t it?”
“I guess you really must be the demon lord himself if you were able to figure that out.” The demon hadn’t realized that I had analyzed her and seen her class, so her eyes ended up widening in surprise as I pinpointed her role. “I hadn’t believed them when I was told that you weren’t obsessed with flaunting your power like all the other demon lords, but it seems like it really is true after all.”
“I haven’t exactly met any other demon lords, so I’m not really sure what you mean, but whatever. I’ll hear you out. Follow me.” I used my jaw to point in the direction of the cave before spinning around and flying off. Heh. I’ve always wanted to do that.Upon glancing behind me, I found that the hooded lady hadn’t hesitated in agreeing to change locations; she had obediently followed right behind me.***I brought Hoodgirl to the ryokan, the Japanese styled, hot spring hotel situated in the plains. We ended up finding ourselves in the exact same room I’d shown the hero to when she first stopped by.“Well, we’re here.” I grabbed a pair of cushions from the corner of the room, sat on one, and set the other in front of me. “Here, sit on one of these.”
“I-I can’t believe it…” Agent McHoodface muttered with a dumbfounded look on her face as she obeyed and positioned herself on the cushion. “I can’t believe that there was both a massive field and an entire castle inside of a cave…”My guest had started to underestimate me when I first showed her to the cave, but her expression had changed to one of shock the moment I opened the door that led to the grasslands. She had been left completely and utterly flabbergasted by the scene before her eyes.As much as I enjoyed the reaction, I couldn’t help but feel that it was inappropriate. She was supposed to be a member of the secret service, a master spy that could work behind the scenes in order to carry out her country’s will. And yet, here she was wearing her feelings on her sleeve. Of course, I was only able to see her expression because she had removed the hood that had been obscuring most of her face. I had already figured as much after hearing her voice, but she was much younger than her occupation might have otherwise suggested. She was at that odd age where she was almost but not quite yet an adult. Her face, which for the most part appeared fully matured, still seemed to carry a slight hint of a childish innocence.Her looks didn’t differ much from the typical demonic archetype I had in mind. A pair of small horns decorated her head. And though I hadn’t noticed it earlier, a thin tail peeked out from the underside of her cloak.The door clattered open right as the girl took a seat. The only other demon girl I knew entered with a tray in hand and two cups situated on top of it.“I’ve brought the two of you some tea, My Lord,” she said.
“Thanks, Leila.” Though I responded in the usual tone, I was actually really impressed by the maid’s work. The only thing I’d told her was that I going to go greet our uninvited guest and that there was a chance I would bring said guest to the ryokan if they happened to want to come along. And yet, she had managed to bring us fresh tea the moment we sat down. Like, wow. That timing though. If I had a scouter that measured maid power levels, it’d probably tell me that Leila’s got something in the realm of 530k. And hell, this isn’t even her final form. If she got serious, she’d probably overload the scouter and blow it up.After contemplating a series of random thoughts, I turned back towards the person I was sitting across to find that she too was looking at the maid.“Did you just say… Leila?” The expression on the agent’s face was one that demonstrated a sense of astonishment. “Do you mean THE Leila? The one they call the Incarnation of Philomathy!?”Uhh… what?<– Prev — Next –>

Messenger — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“The Embodiment of Philomathy? That’s a fancy title. Do they really call you that?” I asked the maid. I mean, I can kinda see it. She’s got one hell of a curious streak.
“How embarrassing,” said Leila with a giggle. She pressed one of her palms against her cheek and leant into it as her face turned a slight shade of pink. “They used to call me that in my younger days.”Younger days? I couldn’t help but cock an eyebrow. Wait, aren’t you even younger than I am? Err, on second thought, technically not anymore, huh? Discounting my life back on Earth, I’m less than a year old, which makes everyone that isn’t a monster much, much older than me. Hell, even Illuna’s older than me. I should probably tell her that and act the part of a younger sibling for a bit. I’m sure that’d make her incredibly happy.“L-Last I heard, you left the demon realm and visited a human territory in order to procure herbs that you couldn’t find anywhere else,” said Agent McHoodface. “Why is someone as knowledgeable as you all the way out here doing the work of a common housemaid!?”The agent’s reaction seemed to indicate that Leila was something of a celebrity. At the very least, she was accomplished enough to have earned the respect of someone working as one of the government’s secret operatives.Unlike said secret operative, I had an idea as to what had happened to Leila following her departure from the demon realm. She had probably been captured by slave traders and taken to the city I attacked while she was out looking for herbs.“Well, such is life,” said Leila.
“Huh? I don’t see ho—” Hoodgirl tried to raise a doubt, but Leila cut her off.
“Such. Is. Life.” The maid stressed each word individually. Though she was smiling, she gave off an incredible aura of pressure. It was obvious that she wasn’t going to budge even the slightest bit.
“I-If you say so.”I was pretty curious as to the details of Leila’s circumstances, but like my hooded friend, I was a bit too terrified of her to press the question much further, especially since it didn’t seem like she would talk even if I did.“And I believe that it might be in your best interest to get back to the business that you had with My Lord? Isn’t that why you came all this way?”
“R-Right, please excuse my behaviour.” The demon girl paused for a moment to regain her composure before continuing. “Allow me to begin by introducing myself. My name is Haloria Laylott, and I serve a man also often referred to as a demon lord, the king of the demon realm. I’m here on his behalf today in order to act as his messenger.”
“Nice to meet you, Haloria. I’m pretty sure you’re well aware of this already, but I’m Yuki.”Agent McHoodface spent a few moments in silent contemplation before finally beginning to speak once more.“I will begin by telling you more about the current state of the demon realm, the kingdom that we demons inhabit.”***“The man that you defeated in Allysia was affiliated with the faction headed by a group of fiends. Like us, they also know that this is the area that you’re based in, and they weren’t very happy with the way that you ruined their plans and stepped all over their pride. They’re sure to plot against you if left to their own devices,” concluded Agent McHoodface.“I see…” I gave a non-committal answer as I contemplated everything she had told me.There was a lot of information, but it was all fairly straight forward. There didn’t seem to be anything particularly complicated or convoluted. Long story short, the demon realm consisted of two major political factions. One was headed by the demon lord that ruled over the realm. Alright, you know what? I know people use it to refer to him and all, but calling him a demon lord is just going to make this shit super confusing. I’mma just call him the demon king or the lord of the demon realm or something.The demon king’s faction was more liberal. It consisted of thinkers that wanted to change the way demons thought, people that understood that the king shouldn’t always just be the guy that fared best in combat. The fact that a single fighter couldn’t win them the war against humanity was something that they had awoken to after the many unfavourable scenarios they’d experienced in recent times. Their motto was reconciliation. Those that flew the demon king’s flag wished to cooperate with the other races.On the other hand was a faction whose leadership consisted mostly of members of the fiend race. They were more traditional and valued muscle over brainpower. They wanted demons to continue thinking of strength as a demon’s greatest virtue, and they believed that brute force conquest was the way to winning the war. They were convinced that they could literally smash right through all their enemies with naught but overwhelming power. And in the past, they hadn’t been wrong. Demons had incredible specs, both from physical and magical standpoints. And that was the problem. Their method had precedence.Apparently, I managed to royally mess up one of their plans when I paid my good friend the prince a visit. Though I didn’t know the plan’s details, hearing her describe the opposing faction had led me to think that they weren’t exactly the type to come up with schemes anywhere as complex as the one I had unravelled had seemed to be. Of course, I questioned her about it and she told me that, although brute force was at the core of the fiend faction’s values, they did still have a few thinkers. One of the demon races that supported their ideology was made up of individuals that loved to conspire.The king’s faction didn’t find the current state of the demon realm to be in their favour. The older school of thought was more prevalent amongst the populace. But unlike his political foes, the demon king had the support of all the other races. Most non-demons preferred to have those that inhabited the demon realm as their allies as opposed to their enemies. As such, the two parties were about equal in terms of overall influence.Hearing her out made a disturbing fact immediately apparent. A civil war was imminent, one that could engulf the entire nation at a moment’s notice. The current state of the demon realm was like that of a keg stuffed full of gunpowder with a lit match sitting right on top of it. It was going to explode. Period. Almost kinda reminds me of the history of the Balkans.An uncontrolled explosion was the exact scenario that the demon king wanted to avoid, at least at the moment. Having fewer supporters meant being put at a disadvantage in the case of an all-out war. Though I guess that’s why they’re trying to make friends wherever they can, huh? Why else would they send someone all the way out here? We’re literally in the middle of nowhere.“What do you think, Leila?” I turned towards my trusty maid after considering everything I was told.
“Let’s see…” She too paused to think, but just a moment before once again beginning to speak. “The state of the demon realm, as she described it, is fairly similar to the state it was in when I left. However, from the sounds of it, the situation has gotten much worse in a very short span of time. That isn’t to say that it doesn’t sound realistic. Leading the situation to degenerate so rapidly seems quite characteristic of the fiend faction’s actions.”
“Hmmm…”I spent another few moments contemplating the situation after hearing Leila confirm that it at least didn’t seem like a total fib. Still, it didn’t change my stance. The truth of the matter was that I didn’t care which faction came out on top. I didn’t care which of the two had the greater chance at victory, nor did I care about the moral high ground. It just wasn’t any of my business. Civil war? Sure, whatever, I don’t care. Have fun. You think I give half a fuck? Hell naw.However, assuming the agent wasn’t lying to me, the fiend faction had already classified me as an enemy, which meant I was going to have to deal with the idiots eventually. I was inclined to believe her. I didn’t exactly think highly of them. They tried to use Lefi as a tool, a means for slaughter. And for that, I would never forgive them. There was a good chance that they would attempt to attack me, us, as a means of “restoring their honour,” so it was better for me to proactively address the problem by nipping it in the bud before the fiends tried anything funny. But again, that was assuming that the agent was telling me the truth.“As someone we share an enemy with, we want you to become one of our allies.” Seeing that I hadn’t yet been sold, the agent immediately followed up with another appeal. “We were hoping that we would be able to rely on each other for help should either of us ever need it.”
“I get what you’re saying, but honestly, I’m not sure I can trust you just yet,” I said. “But alright, let’s just assume that I do go ahead and decide to help you. What’s in it for me? It doesn’t really sound like you’ve put much on the table.”
“The most valuable thing we can offer you is intel. We have been observing the fiends and those that work for them in close detail.” The agent once again allowed her emotions to surface as she pursed her lips. “Unfortunately, that’s all we can really offer. I hate to say this, but we don’t have that much influence right now.”
“Ehhh.” I shrugged. “Yeah, I kinda figured.”
“I know that we’re not really in any position to be asking this of you, but could you please do us the favour of visiting the demon realm and speaking with our demon lord? We would like you to meet with him as soon as possible in order to discuss aspects like the reward in further detail,” said the agent. “The truth is that our king truly wished to visit you in person, but it just wasn’t feasible. He can’t leave the throne vacant for so long in times like these.”I couldn’t really find any fault in the king’s choice. We were way out in the boonies. Visiting the dungeon seemed like the type of task that would take a good bit of time given its remote location. The monsters that populated the Wicked Forest didn’t exactly do would-be travellers any favours either. Escorting a VIP through the forest simply wasn’t practical.“You guys sure love being courteous to your potential allies, huh?”To be honest, I was surprised by their attitude. I never would have thought that the king himself would even consider going through so much trouble just to get that one extra guy.“We don’t normally go this far,” said the agent. “This case is an exception.”
“Huh…”
“Yuki, demon lord of the Wicked Forest, we have heard many tales of the strength you wield. You managed to completely dismantle one of the fiend faction’s ploys whilst in Alshir. You are powerful enough to inhabit the Wicked Forest, a hostile environment marked unsuitable for life, and you are even on friendly terms with its ruler, the Supreme Dragon. Your ability to maintain a dungeon in the territory of a literal living legend is enough of a testament to your strength in and of itself. It is clear to us that you are no ordinary man.”Hearing her excessive praise elicited a grimace. You know, when you put it like that, I do seem pretty impressive. But please don’t. Honestly, I didn’t really plan for any of this. It all just kinda happened. That whole friendly terms with the Supreme Dragon thing? Yeah, all I really did was feed her a bit of chocolate. You’re almost making it sound like we suddenly started getting along because she acknowledged my strength or something. Still though. Man, these freaking spies. How the hell do they know so much about me? I guess that whole secret service class she’s got isn’t just for show, huh?“Our king would love to meet with you so long as he is given a realistic opportunity to do so,” said Agent McHoodface. “We would appreciate if you would give us a chance to win you over. I’m sure that he’ll offer you plenty of rewards and benefits beyond what we discussed today should you consider aiding him. That’s just how much we value you as an ally.”
“I see…” Again, I spent a moment contemplating my choices. Specifically, I centred my thoughts on the demon realm itself. “I mean, it does sound like a pretty good vacation spot.”
“Huh?” The intelligence operative blinked a few times in confusion.
“I was just talking to myself. Don’t worry about it,” I said.I mean, it’s called the friggin’ demon realm. It’s sure to be filled with all sorts of stuff the likes of which I’ve never seen. Yeah, you know what? This is perfect. I could totally just use this as an opportunity to take everyone out on a trip. Errrr, wait a second. Nonononono, hold up Yuki. The hell are you thinking? Fucking retard. The only reason this agent is here to begin with is just ‘cause her boss wants you to help them fix the whole instability issue. God, I’m dumb as bricks. Why the hell would you even consider bringing the kids if the whole goddamn country could go up in flames at a moment’s notice? Yeah, fuck that. Sorry girls, but Enne aside, you’re just going to have to watch the house. That means Leila’s probably going to need to stay too so she can help take care of everyone. Lyuu too, I guess. I mean, I think she’s at least kinda useful… sometimes.That just leaves Lefi, which is pretty much perfect. I’ve been meaning to take her somewhere anyway. You know, for a honeymoon and whatnot. This looks like it’d pretty much be the perfect opportunity for just that. I should probably talk to her about it first instead of just going ahead and booking us in, but we’ve been pretty flirty lately, so I’m pretty sure she’ll totally give me the okay. Oh man, I’m getting pumped. I’m really liking the sound of a honeymoon right about now.There was always the possibility that the fiends might launch an attack on me while I was away, but I wasn’t really all that worried. I had set a bunch of traps and gotten myself new monsters precisely because I had seen times like these coming. Besides, as he was now, Rir could easily handle them by himself so long as they didn’t bring anything as absurd as the monsters that lurked within the deepest parts of the Wicked Forest’s western region. He’s gotten hella stronk.I still wasn’t absolutely certain that my foes wouldn’t manage to pull something, but they were currently stuck in a deadlock with the demon realm’s king. Their pride was important, but they just didn’t have the resources to waste. I highly doubted that they had the means to launch any sort of real attack.“I’m thinking of agreeing to meeting your king and whatnot, but I’m going to have to check with my wife first.”
“Wait, aren’t you a dungeon master!? You have a wife!?”
“Yup. She’s just the most adorable thing. I could probably brag about her all day,” I said with a grin. “Anyway, back on topic, we’ll probably have everything figured out by tomorrow. You can go ahead and borrow a room if you need a place to stay. Heading home and coming back in the morning sounds like it’d probably be a huge pain in the ass, so feel free.”
“I hope you don’t mind me taking you up on that offer,” said Agent McHoodface in a guilty, reluctant tone of voice. “I’ve been attacked by way too many monsters today already…”Yeahhhhh. The monsters around here are assholes. Indiscriminate little bastards basically attack everything they see. I guess that must mean you were chased around until you finally managed to make it all the way to the dungeon, huh? Though I guess it kinda makes sense. They’re only called monsters because they’re violent and ferocious after all. Oh, and because they can terrify the hell out of people. That is literally how the word is defined, after all.“Well, I guess that settles that then.” I turned to face the maid. “Sorry Leila, but could you do me a favour and get her set up to stay the night?”
“Of course, My Lord. I’ll have it done immediately.”
“I-I think I’ll be fine. I’ve caused you enough trouble already. Just having a roof over my head is already way more than I could have asked for. I couldn’t possibly impose any further. I can just figure everything out myself.”Agent McHoodface panicked as she tried to tell Leila that she didn’t need any assistance. It seemed that she wasn’t all that keen on having a celebrity do the work of a common servant just for her sake.“It’s fine. My Lord has already given the order.” However, the ever nonchalant, reliable maid insisted with a smile and continued to do her job nonetheless.And that was that. With her lodgings decided, the agent and I ended our talks for the day. You know, now that I think about it, how the hell does Leila know about the Demon Realm’s Secret Service? I mean, I casually asked her ‘cause I figured she’d know since she knows all sorts of stuff, but that’s only because I’m used to having the internet. Knowing about things like the FBI back where I lived was totally normal because of the nature of computer-driven data. But here, that kinda stuff doesn’t exist. The average person shouldn’t know that there even is a secret service. She totally did though. She even knew about the stuff they did. How the fuck…? Goddamn Leila. Just who the hell are you!?I had assumed that speaking to someone who knew of Leila’s past would allow me to learn more about her identity, but it had ended up doing the exact opposite. The shroud that obscured her history had only grown thicker.<– Prev — Next –>

Yuki’s Family Meeting
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“I shan’t be going.”
“N-No way…”I was stunned, so stunned that I collapsed and fell onto all fours. And it was all because asking Lefi out on a honeymoon had resulted in an indifferent rejection. I didn’t have a mirror on hand, so I couldn’t actually check to confirm, but I was almost certain that my expression was akin to that of someone experiencing the apocalypse.“Y-You need not demonstrate such dismay,” said Lefi. She approached me after being momentarily taken aback by the sheer extent of my disappointment. “It is not as if I wish not to accompany you. It is merely a matter of mismatched schedules.”
“Mismatched schedules? What do you mean?”
“I-It is not a matter that requires your attention,” said Lefi. “I shall accompany you the next time you wish to embark on an excursion, so I ask that you remain patient until then.”
“Promise?”
“You have my word,” said Lefi as she brushed one of her hands against my cheek. “So please, do get up off the ground.”I nodded, picked myself up, and began sitting cross-legged where I had collapsed. Lefi moved to sit down in front of me, but I grabbed her, turned her so she was facing up at an angle, and pulled her into my lap.“W-What is it that you are doing!?” She looked up at me from her newfound position, flustered. Her cheeks had been dyed a shade of crimson.
“Well, I’m about to spend a bunch of time without you, so I’m doing myself a favour and pumping my tanks full of Lefium before I go,” I said as I wrapped my arms around her waist and pulled her into a hug.
“Good grief…” she heaved an exasperated sigh before leaning back into my chest. “What even is this ‘Lefium’ of which you speak?”Rather than answering her question, I buried my face in her hair and took in her familiar scent. In doing so, I immediately put myself at ease. Oh well. I guess I’ll just have to put up with it for now. But don’t think you’re scot-free just yet, Lefi. Next time we go out, we’re going to do so many date things that I’m going to be fully satisfied, and you’re going to be stuck with your face as bright as a cherry for days.Of course, not having Lefi come with me wasn’t all negative. I couldn’t deny that having her around would rid me of the last bit of anxiety I had. With her guarding it, the dungeon would be fine, even if the worst came to pass. I wasn’t keen on asking my wife, the woman I had tasked myself with protecting, to keep the house safe, but the girls were here. Their safety meant far more to me than something as inconsequential as my pride.“So you said you’re gonna be leavin’ tomorrow, Master?” Lyuu, who had been waiting for a chance to enter the conversation, finally judged that it was her turn to speak. Because she had been putting up with watching us flirt, the look in her eyes wasn’t a pleasant one. It clearly described the fact that she was both fed up and unimpressed. “How long are ya plannin’ to be in the demon realm?”
“Honestly, dunno,” I said. “I don’t really plan on staying that long, but I honestly don’t know how much time it’ll take for me to finish up all my business.”My uncertainty stemmed from the fact that I had no idea as to exactly what the demon king even wanted from me. I couldn’t exactly make plans without figuring it all out first.“I shouldn’t be gone for any more than two weeks. I’ll make sure to drop by and let everyone know if it seems like it’ll end up taking any longer,” I said. “Sorry girls, but I’m not going to be able to take you with me this time.”
“Does that mean you’re going to take us with you next time?” asked Illuna.
“Of course. You can count on it.”
“Yay!”Both the vampire and the slime that looked exactly like her cheered as they confirmed that they’d soon be able to go on a trip. Enne was the only one coming this time. I felt a bit bad because it almost seemed like I was playing favourites, but it wasn’t really my fault. Enne was my primary weapon. Entering what could potentially be enemy territory without her didn’t exactly seem like the brightest of ideas. Sorry girls, but I promise you can come next time. And that goes for the wraith sisters too.“Are you certain you wish to go through with this, My Lord?” asked Leila. “The agent didn’t seem to be offering you much in the way of benefits.”Unlike the others, the wiser of the two maids had been present when Agent McHoodface gave her spiel. She knew exactly what had been said in far greater detail than anyone else present.“You’re not wrong, but I was planning to visit the demon realm in order to settle a bit of business anyway.”The opportunity was convenient. It offered both a guide and a chance to chat with some of the big wigs. I wasn’t about to pass it up for no reason. Leila was completely correct in her interpretation of the events. The agent really hadn’t offered me anything but intel. There was almost nothing in it for me. But I didn’t mind. Intel on the assholes I had tentatively marked as my enemies was all that I’d been after to begin with.I had never expected them to offer me anything in the way of assistance in combat. I was already strong enough to get myself through basically anything. I knew that overestimating myself was a terrible idea, but having a bunch of weak, half-assed allies that couldn’t pull their weight was only going to make everything worse.As much as it irritated me to admit, I felt a certain amount of appreciation for the Douchelord. The idiot had used me to kill himself, which in turn granted me power and confidence in equal proportions. There was always the concern that the enemy would have some sort of incredibly powerful warrior in their service, but Leila had informed me that, at the very least, there were no demons capable of pulling off something as absurd as matching a dragon in single combat.I wasn’t going to have the dungeon’s help this time around, but I felt like I’d be fine. I just knew that nothing I encountered this time around could possibly compare to my duel with the mentally deficient ex-dragonlord. Fighting anyone else would be like taking the difficulty down from hardcore to easy.Moreover, the demon king was a king. I was confident that he had the means to pay me in more than just intel. I could almost smell all the gold, silver, and other valuables he’d send my way the moment I crushed the enemy’s HQ. It was a great deal. I’d be able to destroy my enemies and get a bunch of stuff I could trade in for DP all at once. Heh. Sorry demon king dude, but I’m a greedy bastard and I’m getting my grubby little hands on as much cash as I can get.***Only now did Haloria Laylott finally understand the reason her king had insisted on making an ally of the demon lord known as Yuki.The man was an abnormality. She was still one of the secret service’s newer members. But, like the others, she had gone through a tough training regiment and completed her fair share of missions. And yet, despite all her experience, she hadn’t noticed him. She didn’t know when or even how he had gotten behind her. And that alone was enough to inform her that he was far removed from the norm. Hearing that he was willing to talk had brought her an indescribable sense of relief.Strength aside, she hadn’t thought too much of him at first. He had led her to a cave. And as such, she presumed that, like all other demon lords, he was an uncivilized brute, albeit a powerful one.She was wrong.Beyond the cave lay a magnificent castle. It bore a sense of dignity and overwhelming majesty. It was easily a match for the castle crafted for the king she served. The sight of it alone was enough to impress upon her that she had been mistaken. Only then did she truly learn just how wrong she had been, just how shallow she had allowed her thoughts to remain.She recalled her king’s words, the orders that he had granted her with a smile, “The person you’re about to meet is most likely going to be someone special, someone outstanding. Do whatever it takes to make him our ally. And once you have, bring him to me.”At the time, she had doubted him. She hadn’t thought that the demon lord would be anything but primitive. But she knew now that the king’s judgement had once again failed to miss the mark.She had to live up to his expectations. She had to make the demon lord known as Yuki side with them no matter what. Even if it meant offering herself up to sate his lust.But before she could make him fall for her wiles, she first had to resolve the dilemma at hand.“How exactly do I use this again…?”Haloria stood frozen in front of one of the toilets installed inside the dungeon. Leila had taught her how to use it the night before, but as the method had slipped her mind, she ended up stiff as a board as she stared down the many buttons that decorated the high-tech tool’s control panel. Proper use of the Japanese device proved to be one of the most difficult challenges she experienced that day.<– Prev — Next –>

Departure
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Well, I’m off.” I turned to face the dungeon’s residents with a smile as I announced my departure the morning after coming into contact with the secret service.
“Bye everyone,” said Enne.
“Have a safe trip!” shouted Illuna.
“And have fun!” added Shii.
“I believe you are already aware of this, Yuki, however, I must insist that you—”
“Come home quickly and don’t get held up because I get seduced, right?” I finished Lefi’s sentence for her. “I know already. Besides, isn’t making sure of that why you’re having Leila come with me?”
“Don’t worry, Lefi. I will make sure to keep an eye on My Lord,” said the maid.I couldn’t help but smile wryly. The girls had gotten together for another talk last night, one from which I was purposefully excluded. Their conversation had led them to conclude that I wasn’t to be left alone. Leila was being put on demon lord duty in order to ensure that I kept my hands off all the women I encountered in the demon realm. Oh come on. Demon lord duty? Really…?Though I felt as if Lefi would be the better choice for such a task, the girls had pushed it onto the demon maid instead. Apparently, Lefi just couldn’t come this time around. I tried to get an explanation out of her, but she refused to tell me much of anything at all. And thus, the duty instead fell to the only other person that could successfully pull it off. I couldn’t bring any of the kids with me because the demon realm was a bit too dangerous for them as it was now. And unlike Leila, Lyuu was weak to pressure. The girls had judged that she would likely cave the moment I started to insist on her leaving me alone.To be completely honest, I didn’t think that taking Leila was a great idea either, but not because she was incompetent. The sheer extent of her ability was precisely why I felt she should stay. Leila was the only person capable of actually maintaining the place. I suspected that the dungeon would cease to function as a home without her around. Still, everyone, and I mean everyone, insisted that I take her with me because it would bring them a greater sense of comfort than any of the alternatives. And as such, I found myself with a watchdog I dared not defy. Still though… What the hell, man? Would it really hurt that much just to trust me? I’m not that bad, am I?Of course, it wasn’t like Leila was the only one accompanying me. Enne was too. But as Enne was my weapon, she had the fundamental tendency to abide by my will, and as such, the others had disqualified her from being the sole entity responsible for demon lord duty.“Excellent,” said Lefi. “I am pleased to see that we have reached an understanding.”
“You’re such a worrywart, Lefi. Come on, can’t you see that I’m totally devoted to you and you alone?”I wrapped my arms around the dragon girl, lifted her up, and spun her around.“C-Cease this immediately, Yuki!” she stammered with a blush.
“Oh! I wanna go for a spin too!” said Illuna.
“Me too!” said Shii.
“Then get over here, the both of you,” I laughed.I put Lefi down, picked up one of the girls in each arm, and spun around much in the same manner as I had for my wife. After that came Enne’s turn. Though she hadn’t said anything, the sword girl’s jealous stare made her wishes clear as day.We weren’t the only ones spinning either. The wraith girls, who had joined the send-off, revolved around us as we went around in circles. I was spinning. My surroundings were spinning. Everything was spinning. I ended up stopping fairly shortly. All the spinning was making me dizzy.“Alright, Lyuu,” said Leila. “I believe this is goodbye. I’ll be checking on everything once I return, so make sure you do your best.”
“S-sure thing, Leila! Don’t you worry ‘bout me! I’ll show you that I can put the lessons you’ve been givin’ me this whole time into practice!”The two maids exchanged glances and started to talk about work as everyone else made a load of noise. The first of the two was exuding an aura of pressure as she smiled, while the second pumped her fists as she accepted the challenge, albeit a bit nervously. There was something off about their relationship. Leila and Lyuu had been brought on board at quite literally the exact same time. They were supposed to be equal as far as their positions went, but it was quite clear that they had already established a chain of command. Leila was in charge, and Lyuu was working underneath her. Honestly, Lyuu, I totes know how that feels. Leila’s scary. I can’t really see myself ever giving her much in the way of backtalk either.“Alright guys, it’s up to you to keep this dungeon safe while I’m away.” I turned towards my pets after saying my goodbyes to the girls. The five of them were sitting in a bunch with Rir at the center and everyone else around him.Each nodded in acknowledgement and affirmed that they would keep working while I was away. As far as the new recruits were concerned, this was the first big job and they had to do it right. Nice! I’m glad they seem so into it.“Oh yeah, Rir, Orochi, I’m going to need you two to do us a favour and give us a bit of a ride,” I said. “I’m not going to ask you to take us the whole way, just until we find a good point for you guys to drop us off.”Again, both the pets I had addressed directly nodded in order to express their acknowledgement of my orders.“U-uhm… are you ready to leave yet?” The agent, who had been standing around with nothing much to do but watch as we said our goodbyes timidly spoke up.
“Yeah, my bad. You ready, Leila?”
“Any time, My Lord.”
“Then let’s go.”And so, after saying one final goodbye, we turned around and left the grasslands.***“There they go.” Lefi muttered under her breath the moment the door closed behind her mate and his companions.
“Good thing we managed to get Master to agree to takin’ Leila with ‘im, huh?”
“Indeed,” said Lefi with a nod. “His nature leads him to treat those of the opposite gender with kindness. It is a trait that is by no means anything but a virtue. However, it is one with which I find issue under these particular circumstances.”Although Lefi had made Leila out to be some sort of watchdog, the truth of the matter was that she had only sent her with him out of concern. She trusted Yuki. She knew that he thought himself the type of man willing to devote his all to a single woman. And she knew it well. However, given the scenario presented to her, the dragon wasn’t about to let her husband go on his word alone.Lefi had spoken at length with Leila, who had informed her that their guest had every intention of doing whatever it took to get Yuki on her side. It was a claim that the evidence only supported. The messenger sent was a young woman specialized in espionage, the very image of the type of girl willing to put her body on the line to complete her mission.Men, in general, were creatures easily susceptible to seduction; they found it difficult to refuse women that came onto them too strongly. Yuki even more so. He was just far too kind. As such, in Lefi’s eyes, the young intelligence operative’s resolve was a cause for concern. And she was only one of the many women that Yuki was sure to meet on his journey.She felt that he would ultimately give in to the pressure if they continued to pursue him, that there was a chance he would find himself ensnared by a woman and caught in the trap that was her bed. Emotionally, Lefi abhorred the thought of her mate sharing a night with another, but she was willing to forgive him even if he did—albeit only after a good thrashing.However, that was only the least of her concerns. She knew his character and his moral code. She knew that he may not forgive himself, that he would feel a sense of guilt and responsibility should he do the deed, one that the other party would be able to take advantage of. They would play her mate like a fiddle and force him to dance to their tune.And that, in Lefi’s book, was far worse than him sleeping with another. It was something that she would never forgive. That was why she chose to have Leila accompany him. Because she was worried that those in the demon realm would take advantage of his kindness. She would have gone herself. But she couldn’t.The dragon would have forced herself to accompany him regardless of her circumstances had he still been the only other in her world.But things were different now.Lefi had found friends, people that she could trust from the bottom of her heart. She knew that Leila would be able to protect Yuki from those that wished to manipulate him, that no harm would befall his psyche so long as she was by his side. Of course, it was always possible that the demon lord would pursue an affair with his maid, but that was far more acceptable than any alternative outcomes. She much preferred it to him bedding someone she didn’t hold in such high regard, someone not anywhere near as close to her heart. That wasn’t to say that she would be content with the choice. It would still be a matter of disloyalty, and she would still hit him enough to cause his face to swell to twice its size. But it was something she was much, much more comfortable with.“You know, Lefi, Master seemed like he was feelin’ kinda down,” said Lyuu. “I’m pretty sure it was ‘cause you made it seem like you didn’t trust ‘im.”The first thing the silver-haired maiden did upon hearing the maid’s words was groan. She knew exactly what the other girl meant.“I-I am well aware,” she said. “However, I am certain that his mood shall recover should I spoil him to his heart’s content upon his return.”
“I bet,” giggled Lyuu. “I think that’ll pull ‘im right outta the dumps and make ‘im real happy. He’s totally head over heels for ya, after all.”Lefi blushed but soon shrugged it off in as exasperated a manner as her embarrassed self could manage.“I feel as if comforting him is no different from comforting an overgrown child.”
“Right? Master does kinda have this real childish side to ‘im,” said Lyuu. “But ain’t that exactly why you fell for ‘im?”The warwolf flashed a huge grin as she exchanged gazes with the dragon-cum-tomato beside her.“R-Right, there is something that I must ask of you, Lyuu.”
“Mhm?”
“Are you certain that you shan’t have any trouble without Leila’s aid?”
“Don’t you worry, Lefi! Just leave it to me! Everythin’ll be just fine. I’ve got all the stuff Leila’s been teachin’ me written right down. I’ll have the place runnin’ just the same way as usual even without ‘er.”
“Then I shall be expecting exactly that,” said Lefi. “Illuna, Shii, and the wraith sisters too. I ask that you aid Lyuu in her efforts!”
“Okay! I’ll do my best!” said Illuna.
“Me too!” said Shii.The three wraith girls, who had only recently stopped being absolutely terrified of the absurdly overpowered dragon, couldn’t talk, so they pumped their fists to demonstrate their enthusiasm.And so, with everyone’s spirits alight, the dungeon’s inhabitants returned to the true throne room.<– Prev — Next –>

Road Trip — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“You okay?” I asked as I looked at the demon realm’s agent. Her face had turned blue and she had been left unsteady on her feet. It was a clear case of motion sickness, one she had acquired by riding on Orochi’s head; the way that the snake meandered as he moved had left her in quite the sorry state.
“I-I’m okay,” she groaned.Unlike the other demon, Leila was perfectly fine. For her, the ride had been much more of an entertaining thrill than a vomit-inducing method of torture. The maid happened to be the type of girl with a natural penchant for roller coasters. Haloria, however, was not so blessed. It wasn’t my fault though. Riding Orochi had quite literally been something she had chosen herself. We had two options. The first was to take an extra day and slowly trek our way through the Wicked forest. The second was to hitch a ride on the Rir and Orochi express and reach a demon-run settlement before dark.Riding the two adorable little critters had led to a change in Haloria’s schedule, but as far as she was concerned, that was a good thing. The reality of the situation was that the entire demon realm could more or less explode into conflict at any given moment. Time was of the essence. And as such, Agent McHoodface had chosen the fastest option available to her.Being incredibly hard workers, both of my pets had already started retracing their steps. It wouldn’t be too long before they found themselves back home. The pet/rider distribution had been quite simple. The demon girl was stuck on Orochi while Leila and I rode on Rir. Having the maid sit behind me had been a… heavenly experience. The sensation of her chest on my back was one that had left me a very happy man. That said, I wasn’t going to go ahead and talk to anyone about it. Lefi would murder me if she found out just how much I had enjoyed Leila’s touch. The moment I realized that was the moment I swore that my knowledge of the softness of Leila’s chest was a secret I would take to the grave.Only after the agent recovered did she finally take us into town. The first thing I did after getting inside was to let my curiosity get the better of me.“Huh… so this is what demon-run cities look like.” I muttered under my breath as I examined my surroundings. Unlike human cities, demon cities didn’t require ID. The guards had let us right past without even bothering to stop us. Another aspect that stood out to me immediately was just how varied and active the city folk were. The sun was only just above the horizon. It was sure to set shortly, and yet, the streets were still flooded. All sorts of different individuals were wandering about.There were creatures with heads that resembled some sort of canine walking alongside individuals with heads reminiscent of some sort of avian. Many of the city-goers had horns, but each individual had a different number of them. There were so many tails all over the place that I couldn’t even begin to count them. Reptile tails, beast tails, and demon tails were all within the norm. There were people that walked around on all fours only to suddenly stand up on their hind legs the moment they entered a building. And there were even creatures whose lower halves seemed to have been ripped right off a snake. I’m pretty sure they were called like nagas or something like that.Classifying the individuals I saw into distinct categories was more or less impossible. The only choice I had was to just dump everything in the miscellaneous tab and call it a day. I guess this must be what it means to be on the mosaic side of the mosaic/melting pot spectrum.Although I had suspected otherwise, Leila had explained to me that having animal parts didn’t automatically make one a beastkin. Beastkin specifically referred to individuals that looked like they were human save for perhaps the ears and maybe a tail. Individuals with animal-like bodies and/or heads were demons.Her explanation prompted me to immediately ask whether she was a beastkin as her most defining non-human trait seemed to be her horns. The answer was no. Though her race resembled beastkin, they were classified as demons because their animal-like traits weren’t similar to those of beastkin and because they had the tendency to be proficient in magic. The entire system of classification was convoluted and very difficult for me to wrap my head around.There was one thing that immediately became clear to me, however, and that was that all demons were innately proficient when it came to magecraft. In other words, even the guys that looked like literal animals on two legs excelled at magic. Wait a second. Does this mean that beastkin and beast-like demons might actually have completely different origins? I remember Lyuu saying something about her people descending from a fenrir or something like that. If that’s actually true, then it means beastkin came from well… beasts. They’re basically just mutated monsters. I think Lefi said something about demons being the result of spontaneous generation. They’re supposed to have just popped up out of nowhere because magical particles decided to bond and whatnot, right? I guess that must mean that the particles decided to emulate whatever other life forms they found nearby during the formation process. Hence why you get these weird half beast-like demon thingies. Something like that would kind of explain why even the beast-like demons still have excellent compatibility with magic. Heh. This is interesting. I’m curious to see just how deep all this really runs.Although the city was mostly made up of demons, there were a respectable number of beastkin about. It almost seemed odd to me. The faction with more power was one that preached demonic supremacy through brute force, but clearly, it didn’t matter all that much when it came to the everyday lives of the populace.“Wait! Oh! My! God! Are those cat ears!?” One of the individuals I spotted while looking around was a short beastkin whose head was decorated in a pair of feline hearing devices. She was wearing a t-shirt and a pair of shorts underneath what looked like a set of gear meant for an adventurer. Wait, did her ears just twitch? Hnnng.Spending time with Rir had made the concept of having a canine companion grow on me. But, fundamentally speaking, I had always been more of a cat person, so seeing the cat-based beastkin had led me to freak out. Ermagerd. I really want to touch those ears and play around with them. They’re so tempting! I want to touch them as badly as I want to touch Lefi’s wings, holy shit!The catgirl seemed to sense the passion in my gaze, as she turned my way and blew a kiss in my direction.“Take this any further and I’ll tell Lefi, My Lord,” admonished Leila.
“Bad Master. No cheating,” added Enne.Both the maid that had been walking by my side and the sword girl holding my hand scolded me the moment it happened.“Y-you girls have got it all wrong. I-I was just acting up because I happened to see something rare. That’s all, I swear! I’m totally innocent!”
“I suppose we can just leave it at that then,” said Leila.
“Y-yeah, let’s,” I stuttered. “Not a word to Lefi about this, alright? ‘Cause I haven’t done jack.”You know, at this rate, I don’t even think I’ll have any grounds to blame Lefi for wanting to put Leila on demon lord duty. This is totally 100% my own fault, isn’t it? I coughed as I tried to play the whole scenario off and forced my expression to return to a neutral state.“I can’t believe it,” the federal agent we were with continued to mumble as she stared at Enne. “Is she really the sword? This is unprecedented. I don’t even think I’ve ever heard of a legendary weapon with such an unbelievable property…”
“So, Haloria, where exactly were we staying, anyway?” I addressed the agent with her name in order to avoid stirring up any sort of suspicion.
“W-we should be right over there,” she said with a stutter.She pointed towards a nearby building, one that looked like a typical western-styled boarding house with a fairly modern design. There really wasn’t anything special about it. In fact, you could say that it’s only real feature was how average it was.On an unrelated note, Agent McHoodface was living up to her namesake. She had once again donned her hood. It seemed that, as a member of the secret service, she didn’t exactly like having her face exposed in public.“There, huh? Looks pretty average.”
“That it does, My Lord.”
“U-Uhm, sorry.” Haloria shrank back as she spoke, probably because she seemed to think that I wasn’t satisfied with the overly average hotel. “We don’t really want our facilities to stand out, so we tried our best to make them as average as we could.”I reflected upon our plans as I looked at the place. The time we spent travelling was supposed to span three days, during which we would stop in a total of two cities along the way and spend a night in each. We would spend our third night at our destination, Regighihegg, the capital of the demon realm. First day aside, we would be travelling via coach. And although we were planning to stop overnight, we weren’t actually switching lines or anything like that after reaching the second city. The coach we were taking was one that regularly provided service between the city we were currently in and the capital. The overnight stop was just another standard part of the trip, one that had to happen given the distance between the initial pick up location and the final destination.Using Enne as an engine and jetting my way between my house and the capital probably would have shortened the three-day journey down to just a few hours, but unfortunately, it wasn’t an option. The other two wouldn’t have been able to keep up. Actually, on second thought I don’t even know where the capital is, so I wouldn’t have been able to go even if I was all by myself. Kinda would’ve needed to learn a bit more about the demon realm’s geography first.In games, the term “demon realm” often referred to a place in another dimension, a plane of existence completely separate from the human world. However, that wasn’t the case here. In this world, the demon realm was just another piece of the same landmass. The only difference was that it was ruled by demons. And that was it. The coach we were about to get on wasn’t one capable of transcending dimensions.“Don’t sweat it, it doesn’t matter,” I said. “A bed’s a bed. Now let’s go.”With Haloria as our guide, we entered the inn and got ourselves set up to spend the night in town.***Like everything else about the inn, the food it served was just… average. It wasn’t particularly good, but it wasn’t particularly bad either. Dinner alone had made me miss Leila’s cooking. And breakfast the next day hadn’t helped much to resolve the issue either. Like dinner, it had been about as average as average could be.Haloria showed us to the coach that would take us to the capital shortly after we finished our mediocre morning meal.“Wait. This is the coach?” Seeing the vehicle caused me to freeze up. It was just… wrong.The carriage part of it was fine. It was a bit on the larger side, which wasn’t even all that abnormal given the distance it had to travel, but that was more or less it. The problem lay with the… “horse.”A coach, as literally specified by most dictionaries, was a vehicle drawn by a horse. Specifically a horse. This coach, however, was not. In the horse’s place was a giant mammoth with a hard-looking shell. The creature breathed with such force that you could almost see the air puff out each time it exhaled.The easiest way to describe it was to take a quick look at Monster Hunter and call it a popo with a rhenoplos’ shell. Errr, actually I guess all that does is make it even harder to understand, huh?It was a creature that I had encountered before, the kind that was really annoying not because it was strong, but instead because of how much noise it made.“Can you really even call this stupid thing a coach…?”To reiterate, there was no horse. Having a horse was literally part of the definition of a coach, alternative definitions aside of course. And that was only one of the problems I had with it. The other was the fact that the mammoth-like creature was undoubtedly a monster, albeit one of a more tame variety. Of course, the first thing I did as the question crossed my mind was turn towards Leila and ask her about it.“I believe coaches used horses in the past,” she said. “But as the times changed, demons stopped holing themselves in small tribal communities and began living in cities. One tribe brought Delmell Marmeaux with them as they moved, and they soon became quite popular. They’re used often enough for you to see them in towns like this all the time.”
“Wow… That’s neat,” said Enne with a look of fascination.
“Does that mean you’re interested in history?” I asked.
“Mhm. Leila’s lectures are always really interesting.”
“Why thank you,” giggled the maid. “Then how about I teach you a bit more on the way? I’m sure we’ll have plenty of time to talk.”
“Yes please,” said Enne. “I can’t wait.”Though she normally seemed completely and utterly devoid of emotion, Enne was visibly excited by the prospect of having Leila continue to educate her. The sight brought a smile to my face. It was picturesque. Seeing kids smile sure does soothe the weary soul, huh? I wonder why that is?The agent we were travelling with returned from speaking with reception right as I finished basking in the happy aura radiating off of the small child.“I’m sorry for the delay. Everything is in order now. We’re free to board,” she said.
“Alright then, leggo. Up you go, Enne.” The entrance to the so-called coach was a bit far off the ground, so I lifted Enne onto it.
“Thanks Master.”
“No problem.”After getting the little one onboard, I took Leila’s hand and helped her climb in as well.“Thank you very much, My Lord.”
“Don’t sweat it.”Only after that did I finally board with Enne’s real body in tow.“Oh, hey!” I was greeted by a familiar face the moment I climbed into the cabin. “I’m pretty pawsitive I recognize you, you’re the guy that was meowggling me! I remember you getting real furantic because both the kid and busty girl you were with got really mad at you!”
“Could you not put it like that?” I replied. “You’re making me sound like some sort of deplorable degenerate.”As I entered, I realized that the cat-eared beastkin I had spotted last night was sitting right there beside us in the coach’s cabin.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. I know, I know, it’s been forever, but I have a good reason. Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers released a couple weeks ago and I’ve been playing through that. Got the main story done, and my character geared up with the best current gear, so I’m doing pretty well. Patch 5.01 should be releasing the 15th-16th of July, which should release the current set of 8 player raids, Eden, so I’m looking forward to that. It was such an amazing game, I was in so much awe of the skill that the developers had. Definitely a must play for any JRPG fan, even if you’re not an MMO fan. Many headpats to me and Nirvash, for some godforsaken reason… and thanks to CaTastrophy427, Anime Dragon, John Watson, Mischa, and kx for your questions. And if you have a question for me, leave it below with the hashtag #AskJoker and I’ll reply. See y’all in the next chapter! (Maybe)<– Prev — Next –>

Road Trip — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerAs our coach slowly lumbered along, we naturally began to speak to the other passengers in order to pass the time. Wait, it’s not really a coach, so like… oh forget it. I don’t care anymore. Coach or not, I’m calling it one anyway.“Wow, Yuki, are you fur real? That’s hissterical! Your wife really made you bring a maid with you just so you’d keep your tail in your pants? You’ve gotta be kitten me!”The cat beastkin, Naiya, practically laughed her ass off as she learned of my circumstances. There wasn’t much I could say. The only two responses I could offer were a dry laugh and a wry smile.Them cat puns though. Oh, what am I thinking? Of course, a catgirl would use cat puns. Duh! As much as I wanted to believe that cat people and cat-based wordplay naturally went hand in hand, I knew it wasn’t true. The cat puns stemmed from my Translation skill. In reality, cat beastkin just spoke with a heavy accent. My skill accounted for it and localized her speech by removing the distortions created by her dialect and replacing them with cat-based gags. Kek. Skill pls.“So is she your daughter? And did mew have her with your wife?” Naiya grinned as she directed her gaze towards Enne, who was remaining vigilant of the beastkin girl while sitting on my lap.
“More or less, yeah.”I quite literally made Enne. And since she was partly made up of Lefi’s fangs, one could say that we both played a role in her synthesis. Calling her our kid was well within reason.“I’m your daughter, Master?”
“I think so, at least,” I said. “Er, if you’re okay with it, that i—”
“I’m okay with it.” Enne cut me off in order to voice her agreement before I could even finish my sentence. “And I’m very happy.”
“A-Alright. I-I guess that’s that then.”I couldn’t help but stutter, mostly because I was taken aback by the sheer extent of her enthusiasm. You know, now that I think about it, Enne doesn’t really let it show that much, but she’s practically bursting with emotion, isn’t she? Not that I mind, of course. It’s adorable.“Wait a second, furrends. Does that mean mew two aren’t actually related by blood?”
“There are some… extenuating circumstances,” I said.
“…I’m sure there are,” said Haloria. She glanced at the sword I had strapped to my back as she muttered under her breath. It still didn’t seem like she was over the whole personification thing.
“Come on, Naiya! You really need to start respecting other people’s privacy.” Mille, the girl sitting next to Naiya, scolded her.Mille looked the part of the archetypical mage. She had a robe, a pointy hat, and a large gnarled wooden staff. She belonged to a race of demons known as witches. Demons were, in general, gifted in terms of their magical abilities, but witches were even more so. Unlike most other demons, witches didn’t have any visible distinctive characteristics. Mille more or less looked no different from the average human girl unless I made use of my Magic Eye. The only trait I could note was that she was so tiny and pitifully flat that not even her robe could hide her complete and utter lack of curves. Though, that might be more of a Mille thing than a witch thing.“What is it?” The girl in the pointy hat questioned me as she noticed my gaze.
“N-Nothing, really,” I said. “I was looking at your staff. It’s huge.”
“Oh, this? All witches are given staves like this when we reach adulthood,” she said. “They really help when it comes to casting magic. Our spells still work even without them, but having one makes it much easier for us to keep everything under control.”
“Huh… Neat.”So that’s what staves do. I should probably try making one some time. My gut’s telling me that I should be able to pull it off if I use Weapon Transmutation.“Wait. Did you just say you’re an adult?” I cocked an eyebrow.
“What are you trying to say!?” complained Mille. “I’m a full-grown adult! I’m even going to say it one more time just in case you didn’t hear me clearly enough. I. Am. An. Adult.”She got really close and more or less shoved her face into mine, completely violating my personal space as she pressed her point.“Alright, alright. I get it. You’re an adult and you’re all grown up.” Only after I nodded did she finally back away. Seeing that I was once again in the green, I immediately muttered a certain thought under my breath quietly enough for her not to hear it. “How old do you need to be to be an adult anyway…?”
“Fifteen, My Lord,” whispered Leila.Oooohhhh. I see how it is. As far as I could tell, there were ultimately two possible reasons as to why she was acting the way she was. The first was that she was frustrated because people kept labelling her as a child, either by mistake or intentionally because they wanted to tease her. The alternative was that she had only just come of age. Whatever the case, the end result was the same. She desperately wanted everyone to know that she was an adult, hence the insistence. It’s alright, Witchling. If it’s option two, then you might still be fine. Being fifteen means you’ve still got plenty of time to grow. And if that’s the case, then I’m sure you’ll get to say goodbye to that pitifully flat chest of yours eventually.Of course, while Mille looked like she was still just a teenager, I knew better than to assume that to be the truth. I happened to live with someone that looked like they were still in middle school despite being over a thousand years old, after all. Lefi might be a bit of a special case, but I’m pretty sure there are at least a few races out there that stop growing once they hit a certain age. If that’s what’s going on here, then all I really have to say is well… tough luck.“Witches like her don’t tend to get very big. Aren’t they just adorable?” Another girl, one belonging to the Tentill Devil race, suddenly began hugging and fondling the tiny girl with the pointed hat.
“S-Stop that Rouinne! Come on! Stop it!”Rouinne had two racial traits. The first was a pair of horns. They extended from the side of her head and pointed forwards. The second was a thin, devil-like tail growing from her rear. Unlike Mille, Rouinne carried an aura of seduction. She was so full of feminine appeal that it practically oozed off of her. One could even say that she was the very embodiment of the term MILF. And to make matters worse, she was dressed in a skimpy, provocative outfit that only served to emphasize her curves.Most of the other male passengers practically had their eyes glued to her. Their slovenly expressions made their thoughts as clear as day. They only ever looked away when they felt the need to send me a jealous glare or two, as unlike the rest of them, I was actually talking to her. Rouinne please, can’t you wear something a little less revealing? Having the guys stare daggers at me isn’t exactly what I’d call comfortable.Rouinne aside, the witchling was doomed. The fact that her race basically consisted entirely of little girls meant that she didn’t have much more of a chance to grow; she had no choice but to live a life of eternal flatness. How tragic. Poor little thing.“W-why are you looking at me like that!?” Sensing the pity in my gaze caused Mille to react with a start.
“Stay strong, Witchling, stay strong.”
“Witchling!?” The tiny mage screeched her new nickname at the top of her lungs as Naiya and Rouinne both broke into hearty laughs.The three women were companions. They were all adventurers and they had apparently been working together for a long time. In fact, their choice of career was the reason that the girls were here to begin with; they had been tasked with guarding the coach. Composition wise, their party had a vanguard, a rearguard, and a scout. These roles were fulfilled by Rouinne, Mille, and Naiya respectively.It turned out that Rouinne’s class was sword dancer. I didn’t know too much about it, so I referred to the handy dandy maid-shaped encyclopedia I happened to have at hand. According to Leila, sword dancers danced around while casting spells that inflicted harmful status conditions before moving in for the kill with a pair of blades. They had the tendency to dress lightly in order to draw in their enemies’ eyes as it was easier to cast spells that caused mental abnormalities if the spells’ intended targets were staring right at them.The tactic was extremely effective, especially when men were involved. Evidence of its success could be seen from how well it was working on the coach’s other male passengers. I, however, was safe. Enne would move to block my line of sight each and every single time I so much as looked in the MILF’s direction. It turned out that my sword happened to be enchanted with charm resistance. And much to my displeasure, it was working perfectly.Allowing the adventurers responsible for guarding the coach to casually laze about inside of it may have seemed to defeat the purpose of employing them in the first place, but that wasn’t the case at all. The coach actually had two parties worth of guards and they were working on rotation in order to ensure that both remained rested and up to the task. The other party was currently outside and the two were set to swap shortly. I guess only having one group just doesn’t cut it for a trip this long. The passengers probably feel a lot better knowing that the people trying to keep them safe aren’t totally worn out, huh?The fact that the demon realm even had adventurers in the first place was something that had left me quite surprised. The guild in the demon realm was, of course, not affiliated with the guild in the human world given to the hostile nature of the political landscape. However, they were functionally identical. The jobs listed were apparently pretty much the same, and there would even occasionally be an exchange of human capital. Literally. Human adventurers particularly keen on seeking thrills would occasionally venture out from the human world and find themselves employed in the demon realm.Fortunately for these individuals, the demon realm ran on a merit-based system. Race was irrelevant. No one was looked down upon so long as they were strong and capable of getting the job done. That said, there were only a few souls brave enough to try. I felt as if I could probably count the number of human adventurers I saw on one hand.“Witchling? Witchling!?” complained Mille. “What do you mean witchling!? That’s so rude! Please take that back right this instant!”
“Oh, right. My bad. You’re a lady, a full-grown adult,” I said. “Here, take some candy and cheer up, alright?”
“Wow! Can you believe this man!? How could anyone possibly be so rude!?”Well, someone doesn’t like candy. Oh well, that’s too bad then. I guess I’ll just give this to Enne instead.“Oh man, that was purrfect!” cackled Naiya as she gave me a few slaps on the shoulder. “That catitude of yours, Yuki? It’s hilarious! It’s clawful too, but I cat stop laughing!”Just like that, we continued to idly chat the hours away as the coach slowly rumbled along.<– Prev — Next –>

Road Trip — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Hmmm…” I directed my gaze outside the coach as my ears picked up on a series of shouts and stomps. The suspicious nature of the sounds drove me to stick my head out and take a peek at our surroundings.“What’s wrong, furrend?” asked Naiya.
“We’re being attacked,” I said. “Seems like it’s bandits.”
“Oh, okay.” She didn’t react at first, probably in part because I had said it in such a casual, matter-of-fact tone. But the moment the words finally clicked, the adventurer practically leapt out of her seat and did a perfect double-take. “Wait, bandits!? That’s a cat-astrophe!”A group composed of all sorts of different races was closing in on us. They were just about as varied as could possibly be, but the fact that they were all outlaws was obvious from a glance. The only other uniform point was that each bandit was riding a massive boar. By massive, I meant massive. The four-legged creatures were so large that they stood as tall as horses. The thick, obtuse fangs protruding from their jaws made them look as vicious as porkers possibly could.It didn’t take long for the guards situated outside the coach to realize what was happening. They kicked their horses into gear while shouting at the driver to do the same. A moment later, we began to accelerate. Rapidly.Tensions ran high within the vehicle’s carriage. People started to scream and panic as they were jostled about.Even the two beside me, Leila and Naiya, made a bit of noise. Neither had been able to brace themselves for the sudden burst of speed, so they ended up with their bodies pressed against my own. Ahh… Paradise.“Careful there,” I said as I basked in the sensation.
“Master…” Enne stared at me reproachfully.
“O-oh come on! That wasn’t even my fault! It was totally out of my control!”
“But you’re grinning like you’re really enjoying it.”
“T-That’s not my fault either! It’s what any healthy man would do!”
“Why are you guys still so relaxed!? We’re being attacked by bandits, you know!” Mille reacted to the casual conversation Enne and I were having with an expression that screamed, ”What the fuck!?” at the top of its lungs.
“Well I mean, I don’t really see much of a point in acting all terrified,” I said. “Besides, this is totally helping people take their minds off the situation. Gotta break the tension somehow, right?”
“You’re not fooling me, Master.” Enne called my bluff before it even had a chance to really get off the runway.
“Sorry Ma’am. I understand. You were right and I was wrong,” I said.Fine, I admit it. Yes, I was trying to make up a bunch of random bullshit to hide the fact that I was totally basking in the sensation of having two girls all over me.“I take it you have the means to get us out of this situation?” Haloria directed a question my way as she drew a series of throwing weapons out from her pockets and glared in the direction the bandits were coming from.Oh shit, that’s pretty badass. I had yet to see the secret agent in action, so I had no idea as to exactly what she could do, but seeing her equip her weapons was enough to impress me in and of itself. They served to emphasize the fact that she really was an intelligence operative after all.“Well, yeah. Of course,” I said. “I mean, I know it looks bad and all, but at the end of the day, they’re kinda just bandits. I can take care of them pretty easily.”Our attackers were stronger than the human bandits I had run into on my way home from the capital, but not by much. Bandits were bandits. Try as they would, they would never amount to anything beyond trash. Admittedly, there was a good number of them. It looked like our guards would probably end up taking casualties if it came to a head-on clash. Yeaaaahhh, letting them get hurt and maybe even die probably isn’t the best thing for my conscience, so I guess I might as well do them a favour and wipe the bastards out. Sorry, Agent McHoodface. I know it was finally about to be your turn to shine and show everyone just how much of a badass you are, but I’mma steal the spotlight. You can have your turn next time.“Should I change?” asked Enne. The word change, in Enne’s case, meant changing bodies. She was basically suggesting that she cancel her skill in order to move her mind back into the blade that was her true form.
“Nah, it’s fine. How about you stay here and keep Leila safe?”I casually grabbed a dagger from my inventory and handed it to her as we spoke. As a sword herself, Enne was great with bladed weapons. In fact, she was far more skilled than me despite not having the Sword Mastery skill. Cutting down incoming arrows was a task she was sure to find as easy as pie.For the record, I had tried to get her to teach me how to use a blade. The sword girl had told me that all I had to do was listen to the voice within the weapon I was using. It would then guide me and tell me what I needed to do. Unfortunately, her method turned out to be something that I simply could not pull off no matter how hard I tried. Sorry Enne. Daddy isn’t enlightened enough to hear voices in everything just yet. I’m still a bit too far from Nirvana for that.“Okay,” said the sword. “I’ll keep Leila safe.”
“Thank you very much, Enne,” giggled the maid.Enne tightened her grip on the dagger I gave her, positioned it in the center of her body, and moved from my lap to Leila’s. It seemed that her newfound position was based on practicality. She only sat back into Leila’s arms because she felt that it was where she needed to be to keep the other girl as safe as possible. Practicality aside, seeing the two of them in what was basically a warm embrace was a wonderful sight for sore eyes.I felt the urge to smile, but fought it back as I grabbed onto the side of the coach and got to my feet.“Curiosity kills cats, Yuki!” said Naiya. “It’s clawfully dangerous up here, you really need to stay down!”She did her utmost to continue fulfilling her duty by placing herself between me the incoming bandits, but I tapped her on the shoulder to tell her it was unnecessary and moved my way past her. Alright, time to send these assholes to hell and get back to enjoying my road trip.The first thing I did upon reaching the coach’s rear exit was grab an incoming arrow out of the air. I casually chucked it away before raising an arm in the direction of our assailants. And as I did, I cast a spell.My magic warped the road; the dirt twisted about as it rose and took shape; the path our wagon had just passed over became a literal giant dragon.There was a roar. The first thing the earth-based puppet did as it spawned was to raise its voice and imitate the cry of the creature whose form it borrowed. With the assertion of its presence completed, the dragon turned its eyes on its soon-to-be victims.The bandits weren’t in the best of shape. The sudden change in the terrain knocked their mounts off balance and left them in a state of disarray. There wasn’t even a chance for the vanguard to react. Every man was thrown off his boar and sent spiralling down into the crater created by the dragon’s advent. The rearguard was subjected to a similar scenario. They too weren’t able to stop or divert their mounts in time to avoid the pit. Or their allies. The oversized pigs crashed into their off-balance associates and once again flung the people on top of them all over the place. It was a mess. The bandits and boars had ended up in a massive dogpile.That alone was enough to cull the herd. The number of red dots on my map shrank as the bandits were crushed underfoot by their own companions.“Consume.”Obeying my orders, the dragon opened its mouth wide, bore its fangs, and swallowed the entire bandit crew whole. The move was awfully telegraphed; they knew it was coming. Many of those that could still move tried their utmost to crawl to safety. But it was already too late. The dragon gulped the boars and bandits down before crushing their bodies with its throat. And then, once every last one of my foes wound up in its gullet, it returned to the earth and vanished. Those unfortunate enough to have survived the stone giant’s bite were buried alive and left to suffocate.I had only attacked once, but every last bandit was gone. The entire troop had been annihilated.“Heh.” I smirked. “So, whaddya say, Leila? Pretty fancy new spell, huh?”
“It was magnificent, My Lord. It appears even more powerful than the others you have shown me,” said the maid.
“Mhm,” agreed Enne. “That’s my Master for you.”The spell I had just cast was one I came up with during my disagreement with the oversized lizard Lefi had watched me murder. Its original purpose was to keep larger foes in check. But as was just demonstrated, it could also be used to put smaller targets six feet under. You know, I almost kinda feel bad for these bandits. Getting buried alive must suck. It’s a bit more than just a bit inhumane. But you know what? It’s their own fault. Like, have you seen their titles? They were all murderers. And many were far worse than just that. People like them don’t deserve to be pitied. Hell, the only thing they deserve is to be put down.As could be inferred from its scale, the spell ate a lot of mana, but as far as I was concerned, its fuel efficiency wasn’t all that important. I had enough MP to cast it several dozen times back to back. This is great. I feel like a friggin’ one-man artillery battery. Hell, I could probably fire off enough stuff to turn a battlefield into a literal bullet hell if I really wanted to.Now, you might be wondering something like, “Hey Yuki, why’s it have to look like a dragon?” Well kid, the answer’s simple. It’s cause it looks cooler that way. Why else?Now that the bandits were gone, I was free to return to my seat, so I did exactly that and plopped myself right back down only to realize that everyone, and I mean everyone was looking my way. Leila and Enne aside, every single passenger was staring at me with a look of dumbfounded disbelief.Mwaha…. Mwahaha… Mwahahahahahahahaha! You see this, plebs? This is what we call a demon lord’s might.Alright, now listen up kiddos, ‘cause I’mma learn you a real one. You know how, in novels and stuff, main characters like to make dumb excuses and pretend they’re not as strong as they really are because they don’t want to stand out or kick up a fuss or whatever? And you know how they always go ahead and fucking do it anyway?Yeah, that’s called being fucking retarded.Idiots like them need to grow a pair.The whole point of being a man is to do your goddamn best to make yourself look like a total badass. You want to stand out. You want to show off. You don’t want to be another fucking dumb beta.The point of being a dude is to not have a fucking pussy. Be proud. Seek thrills and adventure. Don’t be the emo kid that sits in a corner sucking dick.You wanna get laid? Then stop fucking wasting your time fantasizing. Don’t let your dreams be dreams. Just do it. Get up, get out there, and just fucking do it. Be a real man, and you’ll get as many bitches as you want. Hell, even guys’ll swarm to you.You hear that, newfags? If you wanna be a high IQ chad like me, then you gotta act the part.“My Lord, we understand that you’re incredibly powerful and that you enjoy basking in your glory, but might I suggest not allowing your emotions to show so easily…? They are currently written all over your face,” said Leila.Right away, ma’am. I’m terribly sorry. I swear it won’t happen again.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. And thank you, Yuki, for addressing the main problem I have with some isekai novels: the beta as fuck protags. I like the ones where the protag just comes out and says “I’m strong as shit, so don’t fuck with me, and I won’t fuck with you”. And if the kingdom has a problem with that and sends an army after you, well, they can’t send an army after you if the army’s dead. *insert guy pointing at his own head with a smile meme here* Buck up, gird your loins, and stop being such a pansy. Ok, thanks Tonatsi and HeadpatFacepat for your questions, even if you added headpats to them.  See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Arrival
Editors: Sebas Tian, SpeedphoenixThe three adventurer girls were the first of the passengers to recover from a state of mute amazement and react to my awe-inspiring attack.“Wow! That was pawsome, Yuki! I don’t think I’ve ever seen a spell that meowssive before! Litterally!” said the catgirl. “You’ve gotta be some sort of famous mage or something if you got spells that pawerful!”
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone handle anything like that with just one hand either,” said the witchling with her eyes wide. “Not even back home.”
“Really, Mille?” added Rouinne. “That’s incredible.”Hearing their praises prompted me to smirk, internally, of course. The umpire sitting on my lap was currently in the middle of deciding whether I was safe or out. Attention-whoring was very obviously going to put me in the latter of the two categories. Getting too friendly with our guards was probably one of the poorest ways I could go about handling the situation. It was possible that going too far would make Enne think poorly of me. Hell, she might even start thinking of me as nothing more than just another piece of shit. And that, that would be bad. Like, seriously, please no. I’d probably get sent into a week-long coma if she ever told me that she couldn’t stand me anymore.As such, I opted to casually shrug whilst voicing a line that made it seem as if I wasn’t nearly as full of myself as I really was. “Thanks, girls. I sure am badass, huh?”Oh, fuck. I think I just said the wrong line. Great. Now I look like a pompous douchebag with his head stuck in his ass. Yeah, no. I’m supposed to be the cool, nice dad, not some praise-mongering retard. Alright, Yuki. Let’s try again. Now imagine yourself as the dad that plays with his kids at the park. Then talk.I coughed to try and dismiss my prior statement, flashed a kind, picture-perfect smile, and then started to speak.“Thank you girls,” I said with a light chuckle. “But that’s just what dads do.”
“My Lord…” The first thing my revised statement elicited was a response from Leila. She paused to indicate her exasperation and even heaved a sigh for effect. “You have already stated your true feelings on the matter. It is a bit too late to be attempting a facade.”
“You’re easy to read, Master,” added Enne. “Your thoughts were all over your face.”W-what!? A wave of confusion washed over me as I reflected on the actions I had just taken. What do you mean!? I’m pretty sure I just pulled off a perfect impression of the kinda smile handsome guys flash all the time. How was that not just what I needed to gloss things over!?“…I think I understand you much better now, My Lord,” said Leila. “You often appear rather level headed and reliable in front of Lefi, but the truth of the matter is that the two of you are of the same variety.”
“Wait, wait. I think I know where you’re going with this, and I’m just going to say that I don’t just look reliable. I am. I’ve totally got my shit together,” I said indignantly. Oh, please. Me and Lefi? Same variety? Hell no. Like, sure, I love her and all that, but that doesn’t mean I’m anywhere near as hopeless as she is.
“I’m sure you do, My Lord. I’m sure you do.”Wait. Leila, please. Why the sudden unamused stare!? What the heck did I ever do!?“Oh, man!” Watching us interact caused Naiya to once again break into a cackle. “You’re pawsitively hilarious, Yuki. I think you’re purrty much one of the meowst interesting people I’ve ever met!”She gave me a few smacks on the shoulder as she continued to roar with laughter. Is it just me, or is it just super easy to light Naiya’s fuse? I swear, she’s been doing nothing but laugh her ass off since the moment we started talking to each other.“T-That’s enough about that! Let’s talk about magic!” shouted the witchling. “How did you manage a spell like that without even chanting!?”The tiny “adult” grabbed me by the shoulders and once again invaded my personal space as she frantically demanded answers.“H-Hold on, calm down,” I stuttered.
“Too close.”Fortunately, Enne was there to resolve the issue. She grabbed the witchling’s shoulders and pushed her away. Well, can’t say I didn’t expect that. Witches being really interested in magic sounds just about right if you ask me.“And uhhh, to answer your question…” I paused for a moment as I tried to think up an answer. “Something along the lines of spirit, I guess…?”
“I see… That does make sense. Ancient demons used to think of casting spells as an action as easy as breathing. Which means there might be some sort of spiritual key. Current theories express our magical techniques as more akin to magecraft than true magic, which implies a difference in our approaches. Chantlessly casting large scale spells appears to be something I will probably need to consult ancient texts in order to better understand as a result of the substantial differences between the systems employed…”Seeing the witchling descend into what was basically a mumbled rant brought a wry smile to my face. I wasn’t able to hear the end of her soliloquy, however, as I was soon distracted by an abrupt sensation. Something soft, warm, and springy had suddenly wrapped itself around my arm.“Wow, Yuki. You’re so strong,” said Rouinne, who had snuggled right up to me.
“Errr… Thanks, I guess.”
“What do you say the two of us find some time to get to know each other a bit better?” she said.I could feel my heart begin to thump. I had already more or less built up an immunity to little girls but never before had anyone like Rouinne actively attempted to charm me. The combination of her soft body and her bewitching smile was almost too powerful to resist. God damn it, Yuki. Calm down. Don’t let yourself get swept away. Lefi’s the only one for you, remember? No other girl can even come close to matching up to her.Winning the game of internal tug of war I had going on in my head was only made more difficult by the fact that Rouinne had started to seek even more body contact.“No. Bad. Stay away.” Fortunately, Enne tore the MILF off of me and then shielded me by wrapping her arms around my face before I lost control. She even went as far as to do me the favour of rejecting the sword dancer for me.
“What a shame,” giggled Rouinne.My young bodyguard’s efforts had been just enough to get the MILF and her tits to back off. Whew. Thanks Enne, I owe you one. Oh man, I knew I was right to bring her along. Leila’s great at her job and all, but I don’t think she alone would have been enough to help me fight off tits that big.Yeah! I’m totally “not” disappointed that my arm isn’t in heaven anymore. Nope. Not at all.“Oh yeah, so those bandits, they seemed pretty used to this whole coach raiding thing. Is that kinda thing really that normal around here?” I directed a question at the government agent as the other passengers finally began calming down and getting back to chatting amongst themselves.The attack was sudden. There hadn’t been any loud signals, nor any other obvious tells. They had basically just come out of nowhere like it was the most natural thing in the world for them to do. Though on second thought, I guess it kinda is. There isn’t really much of a point to bandits telling you they were coming in advance. That would just be dumb.“It’s… about as normal here as it is everywhere else…” said Haloria with a grimace. Her voice was filled with distress, almost as if she felt personally responsible for the situation at hand. “It’s all a result of our incompetence. Normally, the army is responsible for dealing with criminals and outlaws, but they haven’t been able to do much about them at all lately. The political climate is highly unstable. War could break out at any moment, so we need to keep as many troops as we can on hand in the case of an emergency.”Yeah, thought so. Rampant banditry pretty much sounds like the kinda thing that’d happen if the law-keepers were too busy to step in.I was glad that I hadn’t insisted on bringing the kids with me. The demon realm seemed like it was still a bit too unsafe for anyone but Lefi. That said, the vacation we had planned was still going to happen, which meant I would have to try my best to ensure that law and order were restored before I returned with the rest of the dungeon’s residents in tow. Well. Looks like I’ll have to put on the big boy gloves if I want that trip of ours to actually work out.***Our encounter with the bandits more or less marked the last incident of note. The rest of the trip went by as per schedule. We spent a night in the city we had planned to stop in, got on the coach again the next morning, idled a day away, and finally reached the capital as we found the evening upon us.“So this is what the capital of the demon realm looks like…”The first impression I had of Regighihegg, our destination, was that the city may as well have been a maze. The roads were unpredictable. They would lead upwards, only to suddenly drop into a steep downward slope without any indication. Many of the city’s streets were curved. In fact, they meandered so much I couldn’t help but think of them as obnoxious. There were even roads that literally led nowhere; they were encased by buildings of all shapes and sizes on all four sides.Upon looking a bit closer, I found that not all sidewalks were even on the ground level. Some were placed on the roofs of the buildings that loomed over the street. And they weren’t just there for decoration. People were actually using them.I didn’t even want to call the damned place a city. It was more of a maze that just happened to be constructed with a city theme in mind. Whoever designed the place had clearly wanted to give the very concept of city planning a big fat middle finger to the face.One of the structures that stood deep within the city’s heart was a single massive castle. From what I could gather, it belonged to the lord that presided over the demon realm and was therefore our final destination.Damn. This is some nice scenery. Seeing the city-cum-labyrinth illuminated by the oranges and reds of the evening sunset filled me with a sense of thrill and adventure. The whole place looked like it was made up of countless hidden passageways and shortcuts. I could only imagine what it would be like to explore. That said, I knew that the place hadn’t been intentionally engineered to look the way it did. It seemed more like the result of the demons just randomly building shit wherever they felt like it. But whatever the case, I still felt as if it was done in good taste.Of course, arriving at the city meant more than just gazing upon its sights. It also meant parting with our escorts.“Well, bye Yuki. Mew two were real fun to be around. I don’t think I’ll be furgetting either of you anytime soon,” said Naiya. “I really hope we’ll have the furtune of getting to see each other again! Take care meow!”
“Bye Leila,” said the witchling. “I would love to talk with you again about magic in the future.”
“Of course, Mille,” said Leila. “I’m always open to discussion.”We said our goodbyes to the adventurers as soon as we got off the coach. Apparently, they were planning to stay in the capital for a bit. That said, it wasn’t as if they were looking to do anything special. The only real plans they had were to visit the adventurer’s guild and find themselves some work.I was glad to have run into them. The reason the two-day trip hadn’t ended up written off as something dull and boring was largely in part thanks to them. We were planning to visit the demon realm’s adventurer’s guild and check it out ourselves, so there was a bit of a chance we really would end up running into each other again.“I will now show you to the castle,” said Agent McHoodface.She had visited a military outpost located near the coach’s drop off point and borrowed a large capybara-like creature. The massive rodent had a pretty decently sized saddle placed on its back, the kind that could seat multiple people at once. The agent, Leila, and I were sitting on the creature in that exact order while Enne had positioned herself on my lap. One of the first things I noticed about the massive mount was that it was incredibly soft and fuzzy. That said, it wasn’t anywhere near as fluffy as Rir.“Oh yeah. That reminds me, Leila,” I said to the maid.
“Yes, My Lord?”
“You said you’ve been here before, right?”
“I have,” she said. “I’ve visited the capital several times for the purposes of my research.”
“What kinda research were you doing anyway? Did you focus on magic? Or something else?”
“I’ve looked into many different subjects. Magic was one of them, yes, but I wasn’t ever truly focused on a single field.”It appeared that, rather than specializing, Leila instead chose to just pursue her interests and look into whatever happened to have a grasp of her curiosity at the time.“Leila is one of the demon realm’s most famous scholars. She’s so famous that people who study fields she’s worked in are considered incompetent if they don’t know her. She’s left so many incredible papers on such a wide variety of topics that I couldn’t even begin to count them all.”The hooded government employee spun around and flashed me a sort of glare as she spoke. It was obvious that she was trying to criticize me for making someone so incredible do something along the lines of housework. Oh come on, it’s not like I’m forcing her to do it…Thinking a bit about Leila’s past led me to realize that she was probably only still with us right now as a result of the pursuit of her own interests. There was a chance that she would pack her bags the moment she grew bored of whatever it was in the dungeon that had caught her eye. I knew that it was inevitable, but a part of me was stricken by a sudden case of loneliness nonetheless.“What’s wrong, My Lord?” The demon girl immediately seemed to notice the change in my mood, as she turned around and spun me a question.
“Well, you know. I was just thinking that I was probably going to be sad to see you go,” I said. “I mean when you lose interest in whatever it is you’ve got your eye on back home.”
“I wouldn’t worry about that,” she laughed. “I don’t think I would ever lose interest in it so long as I continue to live in that labyrinth of yours, so I’ll be continuing to serve you to the best of my abilities, My Lord.”
“Just what exactly are you interested in, anyway?”
“That is something I’m going to have to keep a secret.”Leila turned around to face me, put a finger on her lips, and flashed a smile I could only describe as bewitching.<– Prev — Next –>

Lord of the Demon Realm — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, SpeedphoenixUnlike the rest of the city, which was bustling with noise, the castle’s interior was deathly silent. It was decorated with all sorts of furniture, but the lack of sound made the long corridor Haloria guided me through almost seem lonely in nature. The still atmosphere stemmed in part from the fact that the castle was almost empty. There were so few people around that I couldn’t help but get the impression that there were barely any in its service to begin with.The only other individuals anywhere in our vicinity were the hooded agent’s colleagues—or at least that was what I assumed they were. There were two of them, and they were both quite good at the whole stealth thing; both stayed concealed as they tailed us through the palace. That said, my magic eye allowed me to see them clear as day despite their best efforts. The sight of them making themselves out to be hidden despite obviously being right behind us was almost funny, in a surreal kinda way.Another factor that contributed heavily to the complete and utter lack of noise was the fact that, guides and “hidden” escorts aside, I had come alone. Enne had literally fallen asleep on my lap while we were riding the oversized capybara. It was an adorable sight, but I knew that it meant the long trip had left her exhausted. I suspected that Leila was probably just as tired, so I had the two of them go on ahead. Specifically, I sent them to the room the demon king was lending us in order to let them get a head start on some much-needed rest. I wasn’t about to make them sit through a potentially lengthy audience, especially since I was the only one that the lord of the demon realm had asked for to begin with.Not having Enne with me meant not having my main weapon, but I wasn’t completely unarmed. I had both my gun and my dagger mounted on the back of my waist, and I could always open up my inventory and grab something else even if push came to shove. Still though, I know I said this already, but man, bringing Enne along was a really good idea. I totally would’ve been screwed without her. Literally. And I’m not exactly all that keen on getting my shit kicked in by Lefi the moment I get home. No thank you.Of course, I didn’t ever intend on letting myself get seduced by anyone but the woman I loved. I knew that, even if looks were to be completely put to the side, there was no better girl for me than her. Not in this life, nor my last. I had simply never met anyone else that was just so… perfect.“We’re here.”Haloria finally broke the silence as we reached a massive set of doors. One would normally expect the audience chamber to come equipped with at least one pair of guards, but there wasn’t a soldier anywhere in sight. In their places stood two gargoyle-shaped golems. The magic-infused statues seemed to do the job quite well, as they both craned their necks towards us the moment we arrived before the door. They focused momentarily on Haloria as if to confirm her identity before returning to their original positions and ceasing all further action.Unlike me, the hooded agent seemed to be used to the sight, as she didn’t even bother giving them a glance before fiddling with something and opening the giant-sized entrance. The doorway slowly opened up to reveal an expansive throne room decorated in naught but red and black. Both the left and right sides were lined with demonic statues, ones that looked like they could spring to life and attack me at any given moment. In fact, dealing with intruders seemed to be exactly what they were meant to do, as, like the golems, they seemed to be enchanted with some sort of spell. Oh, maybe this place is only as empty as it is because everything’s just automated or something. They probably just have a bunch of golems guarding everything important.A red carpet ran right through the centre and led all the way to the throne situated at the back of the room. And upon said throne sat a cheerful-looking young man with a head of blonde hair.“Hey there,” he said with a smile. “You must be Yuki. I’m Phynar, Lord of the Demon Realm. It’s nice to finally meet you.”***

***I was expecting him to be rather powerful given his title, but it turned out that he was actually pretty weak. He was wearing a magically enchanted item that made it hard for me to see exact values, but even with the text garbled as it was, I could still get a pretty good grasp of his power level. According to the numbers, he was stronger than most humans but weaker than most demons.I was fairly certain that even Enne could defeat him with ease. Though that’s probably not really saying all that much since she can easily butcher a fair number of the Wicked Forest’s monsters like it’s nobody’s business.Another contributor to his lack of combat prowess was the fact that the demon king didn’t actually have all that many skills that would assist him in combat. His skillset was instead geared towards honing his mind. He was, as his titles described, a tactician. Phynar’s character sheet seemed to indicate that he was the type of guy that you would find in the commander’s tent rather than on the battlefield, which explained why the other demons hadn’t taken so kindly to his rule. That Devious Schemer title though. Yeah uhhh, I probably shouldn’t trust him too much. Especially since he’s handsome. Yeah, no, screw that. He’s definitely a fucking snake.“My King, I have returned,” said Haloria.
“Thank you very much for seeing your mission through, Haloria. You’ve been an excellent asset.”
“I am undeserving of words so kind.”I casually glanced at the agent, who had taken a knee, before turning back to the man on the throne.“So, I guess you’re the guy that wanted to talk to me?”
“That’s right! Thank you so much for coming all this way just to see me! You have no idea how happy I am right now.” Again, the king spoke in a disgustingly cheery tone. If he were typing, then he most likely would have put a colon and a parenthesis at the end of every sentence.Eugh… The thought immediately led me to grimace. The demon king was smiling at me in a way that I would have appreciated had he been a woman. But because he was a man, the only thing I felt was disgust. That’s just gross. Please stop.“I’m sure your long journey has left you quite exhausted, so let’s get down to business right away,” he said. “The reason I wish to speak with you is because I hope to make use of your power, especially after hearing that you were even able to slay a dragon.”Huh. Didn’t expect them to have figured that much out.“Give it to me straight. What do you know?”
“Not that much, my dear friend,” said the demon king with another creepy smile. “All my men have told me is that the fiend faction came up with some sort of scheme in order to ally themselves with the dragons. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite seem to go as planned. The Dragonlord, who slew his predecessor in order to claim the title, ignored their plans and flew off somewhere all on his own. And then, he vanished, never to be seen again.”Oh yeah, the retard did mention something about having subordinates. I always assumed they were dragons, but I guess not, huh?“My people continued to watch over the situation even after he left, but they lost track of him soon after he entered your territory,” he said. “And as I’m sure you could imagine, losing track of a creature so massive is quite the difficult thing to do. Our understanding was that he was killed.”
“I still don’t really see why you’d think it was me,” I said. “Wouldn’t it make more sense to assume that the Supreme Dragon did it?”
“That’s certainly a possibility,” nodded the king. “But you see, my friend, one of my subordinates is quite the proficient analyst. He’s spent a lot of time raising the skill’s level, and it’s reached a point where it’s become quite the reliable asset. I had him take a look at you and report his findings.”
“And what did he see?”
“Nothing. His face turned pale and he told me that he couldn’t see anything at all, and that’s why we thought that you might have been responsible for the Dragonlord’s defeat,” said the king. “We have no idea whether you were always that strong, or if you had only grown as strong as you are now after defeating him, but the fact remains that you’re so powerful we can’t even tell just how strong you really are.”I see… So basically what they’re telling me is that they think I’m strong because they can’t really see my stats. Makes sense. Analyze is pretty level dependent. And based on all the people I’ve seen around the castle so far, I’d say the guy using it probably needs at least level eight if he wants to even begin to see any sort of useful information.“It doesn’t matter whether or not you defeated the Dragonlord,” said the king. “We still know that you are incredibly strong, and as such, we would like to make an ally of you regardless.”
“Alright, I get that,” I said. “But do you really even need me? It seems like you’ve got a good enough head on your shoulders to crush your enemies even without me.”
“So you do have Analyze after all! I thought as much,” said the king. “Let me just say this before you get any funny ideas about me, mkay? I know I’ve got the title, but I’m not really much of a schemer at all, let alone a devious one.”The king shook his head before continuing.“All I’ve ever done is just pull a few strings behind the scenes in order to avoid an unwinnable, head-on confrontation. And that’s it! I really don’t know where this terrible sounding title came from. It makes me look like such a bad person. Even though I’m really not.”His “justification” left me completely speechless. Yeah uhh… all I’m hearing is that you totally deserve it.“But let’s leave that aside for now and get back on track,” he said. “To answer your question, yes, I am good at coming up with all sorts of different strategies. Yes, I’ve made my enemies walk into traps, and yes, I’ve made them turn on and kill each other so I don’t have to. I’ve done plenty of other things too. But no matter what I do, I can’t win an all-out war.”Phynar flashed a bit of a troubled smile.“The problem is that there are more of them then there are us. And each of them is stronger than each of us too. My strategies will allow me to kill a great number of them, but not all in one fell swoop. It’ll be a long, drawn-out battle, and they’ll just keep pushing through everything with numbers and brute force,” he said. “And if that happens, we’ll both lose. Demonkind will lose. Victory will go to the humans. Fighting a civil war is no different from exposing our backs to them.”
“I see…”The king’s logic was solid. It didn’t really matter which of the two factions came out on top if they were forced to fight a long, gruelling war. The country would lose out either way. Humans could come barging in during or after their conflict and mop up the exhausted demons before they had a chance to recoup. And if they did it well, the humans would be able to wipe the demon realm off the face of the map altogether.As far as the demon king was concerned, the moment an all-out war began was the moment he would lose his chance at victory.“Fiends and those like them like to believe in strength above all else. I’m weak, so they refuse to listen to me no matter how logical my arguments appear to be. And to make matters worse, they look down on humans and think that they’ll be able to fight them off with ease,” he said. “Most of the smarter demons have chosen to work alongside me, but demons, in general, tend to be on the dumber side, so I still have many more enemies than I do allies.”
“I see.”Well, that’s what you get when you trade your brain in just to get more ripped. That said, I personally had yet to meet any muscle-brained demons myself. The only ones I knew were Leila, Agent McHoodface, Rouinne the MILF, and the king. Almost makes me wish I could run into a meathead or two. Just to see what it’s like.“That’s why I’ve been working to make sure an all-out war doesn’t happen to begin with,” said Phynar.
“I get that. But what do you want me to do about all this?”
“I take it that you’re interested?”
“Depends. Tell me what you want me to do, and I’ll tell you what I think.”
“I thought you would say that,” laughed the king. “You see, Yuki, my friend. I would like you to become a symbol.”<– Prev — Next –>

Lord of the Demon Realm — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, Speedphoenix“A symbol?”
“That’s right!” said the demon king. “I want you to do something that none of the beastkin or demihumans I’ve allied myself with can. I want you to become a symbol of our strength, demonic strength. I want to be able to use you as an example and show all other demons that the strong believe in my ideals.”Oh, I see how it is.“So… what you’re really saying is that you want me as a decoy while you pull all kinds of bullshit behind the scenes?”
“Exactly! I knew you’d get it.”Holy shit! This blackhearted son of a bitch just totally straight-up admitted he wanted to use me.“Letting the fiends learn of our new, powerful ally will make them much more wary of our actions. Having you around will make their actions easier to predict. They’ll even need more time to make them. And the more time I have, the more cards I can play,” said Phynar. “In other words, I need you to attract their attention in order to make it easier for me to play my hand and constrain my foes.”
“Yeah, I figured it was something like that.”Publicly announcing the fact that I had become one of the demon king’s allies was a surefire way to elicit the opposing faction’s curiosity. They were sure to investigate my origins given that I would have more or less appeared out of nowhere, and they were sure to spend precious manpower keeping an eye on me. I didn’t know much about the lord of the demon realm, but the bit I did know was enough for me to fully understand that he would be able to take advantage of the situation and throw a wrench into his foes’ plans.“Alright, I’m pretty sure I’ve got a good general idea of what you want. But honestly, I don’t really care about this little civil war of yours.” I intentionally twisted my lips into a cruel smile. “I don’t care who wins. I couldn’t really give half a fuck about the death toll either. Numbers are just that to me, numbers. And it should go without saying that I don’t really care who dies either. I’m not about to jump into something dangerous for something I couldn’t give two shits about. And I’m sure you know that already. So how about you skip the small talk and tell me how you were planning to make this worth my time?”It was true that the fiends were my foes. But that didn’t automatically make the demon king my ally. I didn’t need to cooperate with him; I could easily crush the fiends even without his help. And again, that was only assuming that they really were my enemies and that I wasn’t just being fed a bunch of lies.“W-What, y—” The agent’s jaw dropped in an expression of shock. She opened her mouth to voice her indignance, but she was cut off before she could.
“Haloria? Silence, please.” Her boss flashed an intimidating smile and got her to shut up immediately. She even backed off a few steps in deference to his will.“Of course I’ll be willing to make it worth your time, my friend,” said the demon king with his usual creepy rape smile. “I think of my allies as business partners. Cooperating is no different from starting a joint venture, and joint ventures only exist because they benefit all parties involved.”
“Good,” I said. “So how about you tell me a bit more about the details. What exactly have you prepared for me?”
“Well, there happen to be a few things,” chuckled the king. “The first is, of course, information. We’ll continue to send you updates on the enemy we share.”
“Yeah, uh, that much is a given.”The only reason that I had even come to the demon realm in the first place was because I had been promised intel. Not delivering on it simply wouldn’t make sense.“The second thing I have to offer is one I think you’ll be especially interested in,” he said. “I’ve heard a lot about your family situation, and I was made privy to the fact that you would be interested in taking your wife, your daughters, and your maids along on a trip around the demon realm.”
“Yeah, what of it?”
“If you help me, I’ll use my authority to grant you access to more than just the demon realm. I’ll speak to the demihumans and beastkin alike on your behalf and allow you to not only enter their territories but also visit areas the likes of which regular tourists would never be allowed to enter. Take areas considered sacred, for example. They would normally be off-limits, but I’m certain that a few magic words from me would be more than enough to grant you permission to enter them. And I can even get you acquainted with some of the other races’ higher-ups, if you would like.”
“W-w-what!?”G-Goddamn, this motherfucker knows exactly what I want!“I’ll even throw in plenty of information about all of the demon realm’s points of interest. The demon races may not all respect me, but I am still the throne’s rightful heir. My predecessor appointed me to the position himself, and as such, I have the right to let you into most places. And that’s not all.”The tactician’s assault was masterful. He knew exactly where to hit me to make it really count.“Keep talking. What else have you got?”
“My understanding of labyrinths is that they grow by feeding on all sorts of different things, and as a demon lord, I’m sure you would enjoy seeing your dungeon prosper,” he said. “I can provide you with sustenance for your labyrinth in whatever form you’d like it in. I would prefer to avoid turning my people into sacrificial lambs if possible, but I wouldn’t really mind if you insist.”
“Yeah no. I’m not exactly all that keen on sacrifices either,” I said. It was true that death provided the dungeon with exp points, but that kind of thing seemed a bit too evil for my taste. “How about cash instead?”
“Cash? That’s a wonderful suggestion! That’s a type of capital we wouldn’t have any trouble working with.”
“Oh, and just saying, I don’t mean I want your local currency or whatever. I want things that are inherently valuable.”
“Of course. What would you think of an entire room’s worth of gold, silver, and other valuables?”
“Works.”
“Let’s see… what else was there…? Oh, right! How about women?”
“Nah. I’m good.”
“Really? I heard you were quite the… connoisseur.”
“Yeah, no. That’s nothing but a misunderstanding.”I mean, I know I kiiiinda let myself get a bit too far off the rails, but that’s just how men are. Totally wasn’t my fault. Totally. Besides, accepting that is pretty much no different from offing myself on the spot. I’m not exactly all that interested in reincarnating as a butchered corpse.Though Lefi didn’t exactly fall under the canine classification, she had an exceptionally good nose. She would definitely find out if I cheated on her no matter how hard I tried to hide it.“Well, in that case, what do you say to having the women switched out for more valuables?”I spent a few moments silently contemplating his offer. I was more or less willing to accept it given that it didn’t really inconvenience me in any which way. I was probably going to end up crushing the fiends the moment they bared their fangs anyway. The demon king’s offer was more or less just a nice added bonus I got for doing it sooner rather than later. There really didn’t seem to be much of a reason to decline.Of course, there was always the chance that he would betray me. His titles told me everything I needed to know about his propensity for treachery; I knew better than to trust someone labelled as a devious schemer. But uhhh… yeah, I’m not about to go down that rabbit hole. I can already tell that trying to figure him out is going to be an endless headache and a half. You know what? Screw it. I’ll just deal with whatever happens when it happens. If he ends up turning on me, then I’ll just take what I’m owed by force.Though I was more than willing to resort to violence in order to claim my dues, I wasn’t exactly all that keen on making an enemy out of someone known for their tactical genius. Like figuring him out, dealing with his schemes also sounded like a rabbit hole I really did not want to bother exploring.My final concern was that I didn’t know how strong my foes really were. My stats were pretty damn high. I was pretty sure I could bulldoze most of my enemies without any real issue. But there was always the chance that one of the people I was going to end up against would be as strong as the monsters that lived in the Wicked Forest’s deepest depths.Moreover, like the Douchelord, I was still a living thing. They didn’t have to confront me head-on and brute force me to death. I could still be killed through the exploitation of my inherent weaknesses. Still, even that did have a bit of a strength requirement to it. It wouldn’t matter what they did if they were as weak as the bandits we encountered on our way to the capital.You know what? I should probably make sure I check in with Leila before every fight. I’ll make sure to bring her all the intel they give me so we can have a few nice, long chats about risk mitigation. Yeah, that sounds like it’d be a pretty good idea.Oh, and speaking of good ideas, I should totally wear the clown mask I was wearing back in that human city or whatever while I’m here. Wearing it will be kinda redundant if the fiend faction has already figured out that I was Clownman the whole time, but I might be able to mess with them a good bit if they haven’t. Oh, wait a second. Better idea, I’ll just get a new mask. That saves me the trouble of having to figure out if they already knew. I don’t have any other masks on hand, but I should be able to just make one on the fly if I find myself some mats. Weapon transmutation is preeeeeetty convenient, after all. Oh, and I should probably fake my character sheet real quick too. Alright, what should I name myself? I’ve already used Wye, so that’s definitely off the table. Heh. This is going to be fun. Time to be the mysterious masked man messing shit up in the demon realm! I can’t wait to hear the rumours. Everyone’ll totally be like “It’s a bird!”, “It’s a plane!”, “Wait, who the fuck is that!?” Oh man, this’ll be great.“Oh, right.” I narrowed my eyes as I looked at the demon king. “There’s one thing I’ve been meaning to ask you. Were you responsible for all the shit that happened in Alshir?”
“Nope! Wasn’t me!” Phynar spoke in a cheerful tone as he explained everything as if it were just a matter of fact. “My plans are a lot more well thought out than that. If I was responsible, then you probably never even would have realized that there was something going on in the first place.”Whew. That’s some confidence right there. I couldn’t help but react with a forced smile.“Alright. That’s all I wanted to know,” I said. “I can’t give you an answer right away since I’m probably going to need to consult my maid, but I can at least tell you that things are looking up.”
“That’s wonderful!” said Phynar. “The fact that you’re considering it has already made inviting you well worth the effort and investment.”
“Me considering it has already made this worth it? I guess that means you really did have a backup plan or two in mind, huh?”
“Of course, but your cooperation saves me quite a bit of trouble.”Yeah, I figured as much. Banking everything on a single plan sounds like a terrible idea. Especially if it’s something that you’re not even sure will work. No one would ever get anything done if they didn’t think up contingencies.“Then I’ll be hoping for an answer tomorrow. I’ll have you presented with some of the demon realm’s finest delicacies tonight. Sleep tight, Yuki,” giggled the king. “I’ll be looking forward to working with you.”
“Alright, before I go, I just gotta say one thing. Stop smiling at me like that. It’s creepy as hell and gives me the fucking chills.”
“Awwww. How could you be so mean? Can’t you see that I’m just trying to express my affection?”
“Affection? Dude, gross! What the fuck!? Come on dude, at least leave it at friendship or something!” I said as my face twisted in disgust. “Not that I really have any intentions of befriending someone as devious as you anyway. As far as I’m concerned, we’re just working together. And that’s it.”
“It’s okay, Yuki, I understand,” he said with a smile. “Geez, you’re so shy.”
“I LITERALLY JUST TOLD YOU TO STOP THAT!”I couldn’t help but feel as if he wanted to pillage and violate my donut hole, so I ended up shouting as I clenched my ass in fear. And with said shout as the closing remark, my audience with the king of the demon realm finally came to an end.<– Prev — Next –>

Bar — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“So, yeah. All in all, I think it looks pretty good, and I’m pretty much willing to accept. What do you think?” The first thing I did after getting to the room we were borrowing was to ask the girls for their opinions.
“Hmmmm…” Leila paused for a moment to think. “To be honest, my lord, it’s difficult for me to say. I do think that accepting would be the better choice overall, but doing so will put you in great danger.”
“Yeah, that’s not really something I mind all that much.”The danger was something I’d known I would be walking into from the start. Such was the nature of dealing with one’s enemies, and such was the nature of dealing with demons.Survival of the fittest was a lot more deep-rooted in demon culture than I had initially expected. I almost didn’t understand their values. But still, reasons aside, demons had the tendency to obey the strong. I knew for a fact that the demon king wanted me to flaunt my might in order to pacify and potentially even convert those that stood against his regime. Of course, things weren’t going to go that smoothly. Not everyone was going to listen to me just because I was swole. The fiend faction would most likely still see me as an enemy. But that was fine. They had tried to use Lefi, and as far as I was concerned, that put them well beyond the point of redemption. Agent McHoodface was right. I’m probably going to have a run-in with them eventually, so I might as well squash ‘em while I’m here.That was why I was here to begin with. Functionally speaking, visiting the demon capital was no different from visiting the human capital. Both were operations in which I moved to crush my foes before they could inflict any further harm.“It’s okay,” said Enne. “I’ll keep Master safe.”
“Thanks Enne.” I chuckled and gave the kimono-clad sword girl a pat on the head before continuing. “The only thing I’m really worried about is getting stabbed in the back by my so-called allies.”
“While I can’t say for certain that they won’t, I don’t believe that it’s anything you should be too worried about either.”
“Really? Why’s that?”
“Well, My Lord, it’s rather simple, really,” she said with a nod. “You are only one of the many allies that the lord of the demon realm has made, and I doubt the others would be as willing to trust him if they caught wind of a betrayal.”
“Makes sense…”I frowned as I contemplated the implications of his actions. As far as I could tell, Leila had hit the nail on the head. He probably didn’t want to lose any credibility given the situation he was in. He was already short on allies. The loss of even a single one could result in the tides turning against him. That was why I didn’t have to worry about trusting him on a personal level. Betrayal wasn’t even on the table. Phynar had no choice but to remain as honest and trustworthy as he could given his position. That went double given his propensity for peace. The demon king’s foreign policies suggested that he preferred reconciliation as opposed to angering others and fueling the fires of war. And, honestly, most people in charge tend to have a bit of the whole devious little bastard thing going for them anyway. Yeah, I guess I might as well trust him.“Another thing I was a bit worried about was keeping my associates, namely you two, safe. I’m obviously going to try to make it so people don’t go after you two, but take this, just in case they do anyway.”I handed each of the girls a necklace. Both were plain, silver chains featuring a small translucent crystal. There was a tiny device at the back that let one adjust the accessory’s length to suit one’s needs.“What’s this?” asked Leila.
“It’s just a little something that’ll let you warp back to the dungeon. I know it doesn’t look all that flashy or anything, but you’ll have to forgive me for that. It’s more for function than it is for decoration.”Leila gasped. “Does that mean this item manipulates spacetime?”
“Pretty much,” I said with a shrug. “But it’s only a one time use kinda thing.”To be more precise, the item would allow the person wearing it to teleport right back to the true throne room, the room containing the dungeon core. It was easy to activate too. All it took to activate was for the person wearing the item to channel their mana through it.I had bought them before leaving for the demon realm, just in case. I was pretty sure they would prove useful, both if something happened in the demon realm, and if something happened back home while we were away. Of course, the necklace itself wasn’t capable of doing something as fancy as telling me that the dungeon was in trouble, but I already had myself covered in that regard anyway. That wasn’t a feature the necklace needed given all the other detection-based mechanisms I had at my disposal. Not that the dungeon’s really going to need my help anyway. I’ve got Rir, the others, and an assload of traps on standby. Lefi’s there too. Hell, I’d even say it’s probably the safest place in the world right now, and it still would be even if it was under attack. Not that I’m planning on letting an attack happen in the first place.“Master, how do I put it on?” asked Enne.
“I’ll do it for you. Come here and turn around.” I took the necklace out of her hands and placed it around her neck. “There, nice and pretty, right?”
“Mhm.”The compliment caused Enne to blush a bit before breaking into a smile. That cuteness though.Enne’s personification skill would undo itself the moment she moved outside its effective range. Her more human-like form would vanish into thin air, and her consciousness would be forced to possess her real body. That exact thing was sure to happen if she were to use the item without first grabbing ahold of the blade currently propped up next to me. There almost didn’t seem to be much of a point in providing her with a method of escape given her circumstances, but I chose to do so regardless. Not providing her with the same thing as everyone else, even on the basis of practicality, would have been a pretty racist decision to make. And bullying poor little Ms. Enne here wasn’t exactly something I was all that keen on.On the topic of Enne and race-related matters, her body was actually quite bizarre as far as properties went. Any clothes she put on while personified would stay on even if she was to turn into a sword and back.“You want a hand too, Leila?”
“I suppose I’ll take you up on that offer then, My Lord,” she giggled.The maid turned around to reveal her beautiful, slender neck. I took the necklace and closed its rear clamp around the base.“It looks really good on you,” I said.
“Thank you very much, My Lord,” she said. “And don’t worry, I won’t tell Lefi that you tried to court me.”
“W-wait, hold up! You’ve got it all wrong! I was just trying to be nice!”
“I know,” said the maid with a mischievous giggle. “I was just kidding.”Can we not? You almost gave me a heart attack.“And as for our earlier discussion,” she said. “I believe that you are in a position to ask for additional compensation, My Lord.”
“Really? I thought I was getting a pretty sweet deal.”
“I am sorry to say this, My Lord, I must say that I find your sense of value questionable. Would you mind leaving the negotiations to me? I’m certain that I’ll be able to negotiate a deal that works more in your favour,” said Leila enthusiastically.
“S-Sure. I guess I’ll leave negotiations to you then.”I was a bit taken aback by how eager she was to jump into negotiations, so I ended up casually nodding along as I continued to ponder my supposed lack of common sense. Am I really that bad at figuring out how much things are worth?***Leila followed through with her claims the next day and spoke with the king on my behalf. The two came to a contract featuring three main clauses. The first was that the demon king’s faction would do their utmost to support and protect me. The second was that they would treat me as a mercenary, and the third was that they would agree to pay me a prespecified amount immediately upon the resolution of the demon realm’s current dilemma.Neither the first nor third terms really came with any further implications. They were exactly as they were defined. The second term, however, involved publicly announcing that I was someone the demon king had hired. Though it didn’t actually seem all that significant at a glance, it turned out that it was actually something very important.Functioning as a mercenary provided me with a greater degree of freedom when it came to flaunting my power. Moreover, the fact that they were hiring me meant that I wasn’t a permanent ally. And thus, those I wronged would be more likely to ignore me as an individual and fault the demon king and his faction for my actions. It made sense the moment I began to think about it. My knowledge of history informed me that grudges were often split between those doing the fighting and those that had ordered the aforementioned onto the battlefield in the first place. And, at least according to my study of the post-world war two era, it seemed that the brass bore most of the burden. You know… I probably really should’ve just left all this talking business stuff to Leila from the start. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and uhhh… let’s just say, when it comes to negotiation, this trusty maid of mine has more than got me covered.Dear Diary. I learned a lot today! I think a bit smarter now. Sincerely, Me.The negotiation itself had been quite a sight to behold. Both Leila and the king had spent the entire session with huge smiles plastered all over their faces despite the fact that they were engaged in one of the most intense verbal sparring exercises that I had ever borne witness to. Both spoke with heavy, deliberate words phrased in ways that carried implication after implication. I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the pressure they were giving off. Even just being there had put me well out of my depth. The same went for Agent Haloria. She had been there too, likely because she was in charge of seeing to our needs, and the intensity of the discussion had quite literally left her trembling.“My Lord, I know that you are the type to attempt to resolve every issue you encounter all by yourself,” said Leila. “And I understand that is just the type of man you happen to be. However, I would like to say that it is still okay for you to rely on those around you. In fact, I think that you should be doing exactly that on a more regular basis.”
“Mhm,” nodded Enne. “Agreed.”
“Yeah, my bad.” I forced a bit of a smile in response to their insistence before grabbing my glass off the table and draining its contents.The three of us were currently situated in a bar, one located in the demon realm’s maze of a capital city. Phynar had more or less told us that he would ask for me later because he didn’t actually have anything for me to do just yet. He suggested that we check out the city and have a bit of fun. I didn’t see any reason not to agree, so we went ahead and found ourselves a decent looking place to grab a bite. Hence the bar.Although most bars had the tendency to be rather small, this one wasn’t. It was a decently sized two-story building, and we were located on the second. There was actually an indoor balcony smack in the middle of the second floor. A bunch of ivy-like plants hung from the balcony. The plants emitted beautiful but faint spheres of light and offered the building a secondary source of illumination. Of course, the primary light sources were the lamps that hung from the building’s ceiling.The combination of the mystical lights, the modern, stylish interior, and the calm song the band was playing almost made the place seem more like a nice restaurant than a bar. But it was definitely a bar. Few people were paying any attention to the musicians on stage. They were instead engaged in the act of making noise themselves. Most of the people present were very obviously drunk.I happened to spot a pair of hooded figures sitting nearby right as we got ready to start eating. At this point, the term “hooded” almost immediately made me think of Haloria and her coworkers. But it wasn’t them this time. The mantles that this pair wore weren’t like the mantles that the demon realm’s secret operatives wore. Even the colour was different.Hooded figures were surprisingly common in the demon realm. I’d seen lots of them wandering the streets, so the pair didn’t actually stand out that much. And they weren’t acting especially suspicious either, but for some odd reason, I couldn’t help but find myself curious as to why they were concealing their identities in a bar with an atmosphere this bright and cheerful. Might as well use Analyze. Why not, right?“Wait. Nell…?”One of the hooded figures immediately span around the moment it heard my voice.“Huh!? Yuki, is that you!?”The face I saw under the cloak’s hood was one that I couldn’t have possibly mistaken for another. The hooded figure had turned out to be Nell, the church’s hero.<– Prev — Next –>

***She seemed to be making use of some sort of item in order to conceal her identity, but it wasn’t anywhere near as powerful as the demon king’s. My level ten skill blew right through the item’s effects and laid everything bare. Her false stats were still displayed, but their original values remained right there beside them, albeit in brackets. Wait a second. When the hell did she get this strong?It had only been about a month since I last saw her, but Nell had grown. A lot. She was already stronger than the adventurer I had fought in Alshir. I was confident that she would have no problem dealing with the demon realm’s residents should they aggress on her given the fact that most of her stats sat at around the one thousand mark. Some had even exceeded it. Even her luck stat had spiked for reasons unknown. What the fuck!? I’m so jealous. Mine basically refuses to budge. And god damn she got stronger fast. Honestly though, I kinda expected it. That’s just how the hero trope goes. You know, I kinda wanna see how strong she ends up getting once she’s done with the whole hero’s journey thing. “W-why are you here, Yuki?” asked Nell.
“You took the words right out of my mouth. Why are you all the way out here?” I cocked an eyebrow. “Are you trying to find yourself a party so you can go on an adventure or something? You know, seeing as how this is a bar and all that.”
“Huh…?” She gave me a confused, blank stare. “No…? Why would I be doing that?Right. Of course she wouldn’t get the reference. Yeah, nevermind. Let’s just pretend I didn’t say that and move on. Please.“Someone you know?”The hooded figure asked Nell the question in a bit of a suspicious tone. Like the hero, the other person present was also a fairly young woman, one that happened to speak in a tone that made her sound kinda sleepy. Welp. Guess that isn’t Carlotta after all.Although I had initially expected the hero’s companion to be the paladin I had met in the capital, I soon came to realize that such an event was unlikely. Carlotta had been a part of the brass. She probably wasn’t going to be allowed to just randomly up and casually leave the country unless there were extenuating circumstances. Is it just me, or is basically everyone I know a chick? Most of my friends are girls. In fact, I don’t think I have a single male friend at all. The ratio seems kinda skewed. Does that mean I just so happen to have a lot of female friends? Or is it more like my friend count is just kinda low to begin with? Okay, you know what? I’m not really sure I want to find out, so I’mma just stop.“Uhm… I… Uhh…”
“Yeah, calling us acquaintances pretty much sums it up.” I noticed that Nell was struggling to explain the nature of our relationship given the fact that I was a demon, so I stepped in and gave her a bit of a hand. “We just happened to get to know each other and hit it off a while back.”For some odd reason, the hero ended up flashing me a dissatisfied frown. She didn’t seem all that happy with my explanation. I don’t get it. I’m pretty sure I didn’t say anything offensive. Why’s she so mad?“That’s right,” said Nell with a humph. The hero turned away from me as if to express disinterest before picking up her cup and sulking as she slowly sipped away at its contents. Nell sure is a bit of a weirdo, isn’t she?“Oh, right.” Only after pouting for a bit did she realize that she had totally forgotten to introduce us despite being the mutual acquaintance. “Yuki, meet Ronia. She’s a good friend of mine. Ronia, meet Yuki, another good friend of mine.”
“Nice to meet you, Ronia.”
“You too,” said Ronia with a bit of a nod.Ronia reminded me a lot of Enne. They both spoke in shorter sentences and seemed to carry a bit of a taciturn aura. However, unlike Enne, Ronia came off as drowsy. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see her clock out at any given moment.Her stat page was disguised in much the same way as Nell’s. It could be summarized as follows:***
Name: Ronia Lucidor
Race: Mid Devil (Human)
Class: Skilled Sorceress (Court Mage)
Level: 42
***Ronia was a court mage, and she had stats to match. Most of her numbers, like strength and the like, were pretty average as far as humans were concerned, but her magic and dexterity were both through the roof. She was sure to prove useful in anything that even remotely resembled a magical slugfest.That said, all her stats were lower than Nell’s. She failed to surpass the hero even in the areas in which she was most gifted. Comparing the two really served to emphasize just how special Nell was. She was so divorced from human standards that her raw stats could completely eclipse those of a court mage, an individual I assumed to be high ranking and highly specialized. You know, now that I think about it, she was probably like straight fresh out of training when I first met her, huh? If she had started getting stronger even just a few months earlier, I might’ve ended up getting butchered on the spot. Errrrr, actually probably not, huh? Seeing as how she was so terrified she couldn’t even stand up straight and whatnot. Yeah, you know what? I probably would’ve been fine.Like Nell, Ronia’s character sheet had been subject to disguise. And of course, both of them had altered their physical appearances to match those of the race that they were supposedly a part of. They had small horns on their heads and tattoos on their cheeks. I suspected that they probably had demon-like tails as well, but I couldn’t actually see them due to the fact that both girls were wearing trench coats.“I’m sorry if Ronia ever comes off as rude,” said Nell. “She doesn’t mean it. She’s just not a great talker.”
“Not true,” complained the mage. “People are just bad at listening.”
“But you’re the only one most people have trouble understanding…” said Nell with a wry smile. “You’re so blunt that it confuses everyone.”The hero paused for a moment to emphasize her point before turning towards the people I was with.“It’s nice to see you again, Leila.” She smiled at the maid before turning towards the literal walking sword. “And who’s that? I don’t think we’ve met before.”
“That? Oh. That would be my daughter.”
“Huh!?” The hero’s eyes practically bulged out of their sockets. “Y-You had a daughter!? W-would that make Lefi her mother!?”Nell practically flew off her chair and shoved her face in mine as she pressured me for answers. She got so close I had to lean back to avoid contact.“K-Kinda? I mean technically, you aren’t really wrong,” I said. “And you have met her before. Remember this?”I pointed at the weapon I had mounted on my back.“Is that the weapon you were using last time we met?” she asked, dubiously. “I can’t really tell since it’s all wrapped up in cloth, but it looks to be about the same size.”
“Yup. That’s her.” I plopped the hand I wasn’t using to point at the blade on top of the sword girl’s head and more or less shrugged the reveal off as something that wasn’t too big of a deal.
“Uhh…? What…?”
“To be more precise, Enne is the blade’s personified form. I made her, and she’s literally got some of Lefi in her, so she’s pretty much our daughter.”
“Uhm… Yuki… I don’t understand,” said Nell. “How exactly did you manage to give a weapon the ability to turn into a person?”
“Iunno. We just kinda thought it might work, so we tried it and it did.”
“I…see…” Only after a long pause did the hero manage to squeeze out any more words. She slowly brought her head to her hands and started to rub her temples as she spoke in a pained tone. “You tried it… And it worked…”You want some aspirin or something? I’m pretty sure I have a bottle or two sitting around.“I understand how you feel, Nell,” said Leila. “Please allow me to give you a piece of advice that will assist you greatly in times like these. My Lord and common sense do not, by any means, ever go hand in hand. Attempting to justify his actions and behaviour without a shift in perspective will surely wear you out.”
“Good point,” said Nell. “I would probably go crazy if I started questioning all the weird stuff Yuki does or says.”
“Oh, come on,” I said as I rolled my eyes. “You guys are making me out to be some kinda hopeless weirdo.”
“I’m sorry Yuki, but that’s exactly what I think you are,” said Nell.Woman, you’ve got guts. I’m definitely getting you back for this.“I do apologize, My Lord, but there is nothing I can say in your defence.”Leila, please! Aren’t maids supposed to take their master’s side!?“That’s… not true…” Enne paused for a long while before opening her mouth again. “Master is a really good person.”Enne… I’m glad you stood up for me and all that, but is it just me, or did you very obviously have to stop because you couldn’t come up with anything good to say? And can you like, stop totally averting your eyes and actually look at me? Please? Come on!<– Prev — Next –>

Bar — Part 3
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix“Oh yeah,” Nell reached into her bag and started rummaging around. “I almost forgot, but I actually have something for you, Yuki.”The item she ended up handing me was a letter.“The hell’s this?” I cocked an eyebrow as I took it from her and read the text written on the envelope.To My Beloved Demon Lord“…” I paused for a moment before more or less repeating myself. “What the actual fuck?”
“It’s from Lady Iryll,” said Nell. “She told me to give it to you the next time I saw you.”Iryll…? Oh, right. The princess I saved.“What’s that, Master?” asked Enne.
“J-Just something personal. Don’t worry about it.”I turned my back on the two girls I was travelling with in order to make sure they couldn’t read the letter’s contents before opening it and running my eyes over the page.Dear Mr. Demon Lord,I decided to write this letter as I thought of you while basking in the warm, early afternoon sun. I don’t think that a single day has passed where I haven’t longed to be by your side.I’ve missed you so terribly that I’ve even tried sneaking out of the castle in order to visit you and tell you how badly I’ve wished to see you in person. Unfortunately, I didn’t make it very far. Father’s soldiers caught me in the act and brought me back home almost immediately. Father was so awfully angry he gave me a long lecture on safety. Still, I won’t give up. I’m going to keep trying my best to make it all the way to your home. But, I would be awfully pleased if you came to visit me before I finally succeed.I can’t wait to see you again. I spend every night dreaming of the day you’ll finally kidnap me.Sincerely yours,IryllI could easily tell that the princess had put her all into writing the letter. The handwriting was neat and looked like it had been printed with the utmost care. Reading it led me to pause and freeze up.There was a problem.I didn’t know how I was supposed to react.Iryll had sent me the type of personal note that could only possibly be described as a love letter. It was my first time getting one, so I simply didn’t know what I was supposed to think or how I was supposed to feel. I was, of course, happy to know that she liked me as much as she did, but that aside, I was just confused.Silence aside, the only reaction I could muster was to get rid of the evidence before it caused any trouble. I slowly folded the letter back up and dumped it right into my inventory.“I’m going to be here for a while, but could you make sure to write a response before I leave?” asked Nell.
“Do I really have to?”
“Not replying would definitely make Lady Iryll sad,” said the hero. “I can help if the problem is not really knowing what to say.”
“…Yeah, I’ll be taking you up on that then.”Nell had immediately pinpointed one of my greatest concerns. I had no idea how I was supposed to respond to a love letter addressed to me by a little girl, and there was no way I could possibly consult either of the two I was travelling with. Telling them that I was agonizing over how I was supposed to respond to a kid indirectly confessing her love to me was no different from stabbing myself in the face with a rusty knife.“Right.” I coughed to cover up my lack of composure. “So I know we kinda got off track, but what did you say you were doing here again, Nell?”
“Hmmm…” She paused for a moment to contemplate the ramifications of divulging her mission. “I don’t think His Majesty or Carlotta would be too mad at me if I told you, so I guess I might as well. But you can’t tell anyone else, okay?”
“Yeah, I know.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yup. I think it’ll be okay. Yuki’s an ally, and a reassuring one to have at that.”
“Okay. If you say so.”Though she had stepped in to pull the brakes on the conversation if necessary, Ronia backed off the moment Nell confirmed her intentions. The speed of her retreat was undoubtedly a result of trust. Wow, Ms. Hero. Look at you, all reliable ‘n trustworthy ‘n stuff.With the other girl’s complaints silenced, Nell quickly scanned her surroundings and made sure no one was listening in before starting to speak. “Honestly, it’s not really that big of a secret. I’m guessing you already know who the people behind the incident in the castle really are, right?”The terms she used were pretty obvious as far as I was concerned, but they were a bit too vague for those that lacked context to understand.“Yeah.”
“The incident made us realize that we couldn’t stay passive, so we started sending people over in order to gather more information. The only problem is that we couldn’t send too many. The only people that can really get by around here are those that are a bit stronger, so it’s just me, Ronia, and a few others. The reason only she and I are here right now is because we’re all working on different tasks.”
“Sounds like a pretty bold move,” I said.Being the hero meant that Nell was one of her country’s most powerful and influential pieces. In fact, I wouldn’t have been surprised to discover that she was amongst the strongest human beings alive. Sending someone so important deep into enemy territory was about as risky as playing with fire. Though if you ask me, this seems more like a stroke of fate than anything. As far as tropes go, heroes are more or less destined to be sent to demon realms.“I think so too,” said Nell.
“Was the king the one that came up with this crazy plan?”
“Mhm.”Wow. I’ve really gotta give it to him. That man’s got balls of steel.“So that’s why I’m here. Why are you here, Yuki?”
“Apparently, the demon realm’s king wanted to see me for something.”
“Really?” said Nell with her eyes wide.
“Yeah.” I nodded. “You remember how I crushed some dumbass’ plans or whatever last time I saw you? Yeah, so apparently, there’s a group of demons that kinda don’t really like me because of it. The king doesn’t really like the people who don’t like me, so he wanted to check if we could lend each other a hand.”
“I see… So does that mean that the people who don’t like you are…”
“Yeah, it’s pretty much what you’re thinking,” I said. “Do you know how the demon realm has been split into two main factions?”
“That was one of the first things we uncovered after getting here.”
“Good. That means I can keep this short and sweet. So basically, one of the two factions is the one the king is in charge of. The other is made up of my enemies, and I guess yours too. I hear it’s headed by a group of fiends.”Hearing the details caused Nell’s expression to turn more serious.“Hey Yuki, can I uhm… ask you to do me a favour?”
“Lemme guess, you want intel? Yeah, sure. I’ll pass on whatever the demon realm’s king tells me.”
“Really!? You will!?”
“Yeah, sure. Why not?” I said with a shrug. “The king said he’d tell me a bunch of stuff, but he never said anything about not leaking it. I can pretty much say whatever I want, so it’s all yours as long as you keep me up to date on what you’ve got figured out too.”
“Okay!” said Nell. “That works for me, but are you really sure you won’t mind?”
“What do you mean?”
“The people we’ve brought with us are good at what they do, but we don’t really have that many connections in the demon realm just yet, so we probably won’t really have that much information to share to begin with, so it kind of feels like you’re going to be getting the short end of the stick.”
“Don’t sweat it,” I said. “I already benefit plenty.”Cross-referencing what I learned with what Nell learned might not have seemed like the best of ideas at first glance, but having a variety of sources meant that I would be able to be more confident in what I knew. Moreover, it also made me less dependent on the demon king and his lackeys. I didn’t know how skilled Nell and her friends really were at gathering information, but I believed it was safe to assume they were at least fairly competent.Moreover, trading information more or less made Nell and I allies. Having weak allies probably wouldn’t help much, but Nell was far from weak. I assumed that most of the others dispatched with her were probably around Ronia’s level, which meant they were decently powerful, even with the demon realm’s standards in mind. Chances were, I would be able to count on them should anything ever come to pass.“Is that all, Leila?” I whispered.
“I believe so, My Lord,” responded the maid with a smile.Yeah, that’s right. You guessed it. All that smart sounding stuff? Nope. Not me. Leila had basically been whispering into my ear throughout the entire conversation. And in doing so, she once again proved that she was a master of negotiation and that her foresight far eclipsed my own. Yeah, you know what? I’mma just leave this kinda stuff to her from now on.I was so impressed that I felt the urge to pull a Lyuu and submit to her while say something along the lines of, Wow Leila! Thanks for always tellin’ me what to do!“Thanks, Yuki,” said Nell. “Knowing that you’re here to help makes me feel a lot less nervous and a lot more motivated.”
“No problem,” I said with a chuckle. “And I’d say that this is pretty much as good an opportunity as any other for you to start referring to me as Mr. Chic the Stylish Badass.”
“I think that’s probably the one thing I’d never call you.”Oh, fine. Have it your way then. Though I felt the urge to grumble about it, I didn’t actually mind the fact that Nell wasn’t going along with my whims. In fact, I probably would have been more bothered if she had.<– Prev — Next –>

Barfight — Part 1
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix“Whaddya say to using this bar as our meet up spot?” I asked. “’The food was pretty damn good.”
“That’s a great idea,” said Nell. “I really liked it too.”Nell and I finished discussing the details of our arrangement over an amazing dinner. I ended up giving her two orbs of correspondence, magical items that facilitated long-distance communication. Unfortunately, they weren’t capable of something as complex as enabling chat. The orbs came in pairs, and each orb’s primary feature was to cause the other member of its pair to glow whenever magical energy was channelled through it. In other words, it was more of a remote doorbell than it was a cellphone.They were, however, still far superior to other forms of communication. Quickly relaying large quantities of information over a long distance was a field the world I had reincarnated into had yet to really explore. A part of their relative convenience stemmed from their size. The orbs were slightly smaller than tennis balls, which made them easy to carry around.Moreover, it was possible to compensate for their lack of an ability to send and receive messages or make calls through other means. The reason I had given Nell a pair of orbs was because I wanted to make sure we could send different types of messages. That was why the two orbs I had given her were different colours. One was white, and the other was red. Making the white orb glow indicated that we just wanted to get in touch. The red orb, on the other hand, indicated that there was an emergency.Obviously, there being an emergency meant that we probably wouldn’t be able to head all the way to the bar just to figure out what was up. That was where the enchanted device’s secondary function stepped in. Each orb was able to vaguely denote the location of its pair, which meant Nell and I would be able to come running to each other’s aid if one of us was to ever find ourselves in trouble. Neither of us had many allies in the demon realm, and thus, we agreed to help each other out as much as we possibly could. Heh. The hero’s power is mine! This’ll probably help a bunch with the whole safety issue. Nell’s probably thinking something similar. Now this, this is what we call a win-win situation.There were two minor problems with the whole orb system we had going on. The first was the fact that the orbs had to be kept out at all times. I couldn’t just shove them in my inventory and forget about them like most of the other junk I had in there. But again, it was much more convenient than having to go through the trouble of tracking each other down every single time we needed to talk.The second problem had less to do with the orbs themselves than the people using them. Nell’s court mage friend started to mess around with the pair that I had given them with bloodshot eyes. Dude. Chill. I don’t mind you fiddling with them, but like, can you please at least try not to break them? They cost a good bit of DP, and I really don’t want to have to spend any more. Speaking of curious people, Ms. Incarnation of Philomathy over there is looking pretty damn calm. But only because she already had her fill of messing with it earlier. That said, she still seems pretty interested in them so I guess I’ll just let her hold onto ours or something. So yeah, Leila. That whole don’t break them thing? Totally goes for you too.“Oh and… uhmm… about that ring you’re wearing…” said Nell in a questioning tone.
“Oh, that?” I paused for a second in order to contain my embarrassment. “Lefi gave it to me.”
“Does that mean what I think it does…?”
“Yeah. Lefi and I got married.”
“M-m-married!?” stuttered the hero.
“That’s a bit of a weird reaction.” Seeing her act all flustered and confused led me to force a smile.
“W-When did that happen?”
“Shortly after I got back from the capital, so it was actually a pretty recent event.” I said.
“I-I see…” She stared fixedly at the accessory for a good bit before continuing to stutter. “I-I knew you two were close, but I didn’t know you were that close.”Her voice seemed to be tinged with a sad air of loneliness and despondency. I didn’t quite get why, so I opened my mouth to ask—only to be interrupted by a loud bang right before I could.The bar’s front door had been kicked wide open by a bunch of mean-looking men. They strutted right in as if they owned the place, one after another as they cackled in a manner that no decent person could. I had a pretty good view of the entire establishment from my seat, and as a result, I could easily see just how much attention the group grabbed. Every single pair of eyes turned towards them the moment they made their way through the door. Someone sure seems popular.“Is that who I think it is?” asked a customer.
“Aye, it’s Gej and his guys,” replied another. “They’ve been pretty active lately. The bastards do whatever the fuck they want and act like they own every place they visit.”The bar’s clients were speaking in whispers, but my sharpened senses allowed me to easily overhear their conversations regardless. It turned out that my initial assumption was correct. The guy in question was infamous. He was the kind of person everyone knew for all the wrong reasons.“Where the fuck do you think you’re looking?”One of the men who everyone’s eyes were on began shouting the moment he noticed that he and his buddies were getting attention. Getting involved with the group seemed like a suboptimal choice and most of the customers didn’t quite seem interested in trouble, so they turned their heads away and forced their gazes elsewhere immediately.“Tsk…” The man clicked his tongue before turning towards the guy the group was centred around. “I think the place is ready for you now, sir.”
“As do I,” replied his boss.The boss’ appearance was weird, to say the least. He was muscular, but in a way that made his body almost seem unnatural. He almost looked like a prop, specifically the kind people left in laboratories and classrooms in order to aid newcomers in the study of muscle groups and other aspects of the human body—just with a thin layer of skin on top. I wouldn’t have been surprised to find out that he was actually just a mass of muscles with a consciousness doing its best to emulate the human form. And that wasn’t even the strangest thing about him. Oh god, what the actual living fuck!?Bossman and his lackeys moved through the bar, waltzed up to the second floor, and plunked their asses down in their seats without a hint of grace.“Where the hell is the waitress!? Woman, get the fuck over here and stop wasting our fuckin’ time!”
“R-right away, sir!”A waitress with fiend-like horns and a fiend-like tail dashed over the moment the men started shouting for her. I couldn’t help but pity her. Poor girl. Man, the service industry fucking sucks. I know exactly how it goes. Most people are at least decent, but you’re pretty much guaranteed to run into entitled assholes like them at least once a week. Feels bad man.“If my memory is to be trusted, Gej is the son of one of this country’s dukes.” My maid relayed me a few key bits of information via whisper as she continued to direct a cold glare in the group’s direction. “His authority is further backed by a significant degree of personal strength. And as such, he has the tendency to follow his whims while disregarding the desires of those around him. He is not exactly the type of man the average citizen considers well-liked.”Oh, I totally know that trope. It’s the whole retarded son born with a silver spoon shoved up his ass and whatnot. Though in his case, it might have a little more to do with his uh… personal circumstances than his upbringing. He must have turned out the way he did because people were too afraid to say anything about it given his authority and whatnot. You know what, I almost pity him, ‘cause this looks to me like it’s pretty much a textbook case of the Emperor and his “new clothes.” I mean, I know it’s totally not any of my business, but I feel so bad for him that I kinda want to point out the fact that he may as well be parading around the town with his junk hanging loose.After a bit of internal debate, I ended up coming to the conclusion that someone needed to speak with the kid before it was too late. And since no one else was going to do it, that someone had to be me. With that in mind, I got to my feet and slowly started moving towards the man and his buddies.“Huh? W-Wait! Yuki!? What are you doing!?”Nell seemed to think I was planning to start a fight, so she started shouting in an attempt to stop me. You got it all wrong, Ms. Hero. I’m not hurting. I’m helping.“Hey,” I called out to the men as I approached their table.
“What do you want?”One of the poor, pitiable man’s lackeys responded to me in an obnoxious tone the moment I voiced my presence, but I ignored him. I looked right past the underling and made eye contact with his boss before stating my business.“Dude, you, me, we’re both men. I get it. I totally know how you feel.” I spoke in the most compassionate, concerned, and inoffensive tone I could muster. “But some things are just beyond saving. You really need to get yourself some wax or something.”
“What…?”The man clearly didn’t seem to understand me. He was so confused I could almost see a group of question marks floating right above his head, so I stopped being as vague and started speaking in more concrete, easy to understand terms.“I’m talking about your hair, man. I’m a man too. I know the struggle. It sucks. It stresses you out, and the stress only makes it worse. It’s an endless cycle where all you ever do is slowly lose. But it’s time to let go. You don’t have to just keep desperately clinging to what little bit you have left. Sometimes, you just have to accept the inevitable. It’s okay, bro. It’s okay. I understand. We all do.”I continued to focus my eyes on the crown of his head, the source of my pity, as I spoke. The reason I couldn’t help but feel bad for the man was one that all men could understand. Though he was still young, the duke’s son was already balding. Chronically. He had already lost all the hair that was supposed to go on top of his hair. It was gone, gone with the wind and never to return. But for some odd reason, the hair that grew on the side of his head was still thick and bushy.That alone was enough to make me feel sorry for the poor kid, but it wouldn’t have been enough to prompt me to give him the talk. My problem with the scenario was how he was wearing what little bit he had left. I didn’t know if it was because he was desperate, or if it was because he felt like he needed to do something out of a sense of rebellion, but either way, the oddly muscular young man had intentionally done his best to show off the bits of hair that he had left. He was so desperate that he had the long hairs that decorated the sides of his head french-braided into pigtails. His hairstyle reminded me of the Chinese queue. The only difference was that he had two of them, and they were on the sides of his head as opposed to the back.It was a terrible, hideous sight to behold. I was convinced that the man’s hairstyle had drawn more eyes than his rude, flashy entrance, that his notoriety must have at least in part stemmed from how dumb he looked. A single glance at him was enough to justify any number of chortles and spit takes. The only reason I hadn’t broken into a cackle was because he had taken it so far it wasn’t even funny anymore. It almost looked to me like an expression of self-harm, like he was using his hair to tell the world that he was running a knife across the street a few times each night. Exaggerated self-harm jokes weren’t funny. Taking suicide-related gags too far made them nothing but cringy.For a while, the man continued to stare at me with a blank look on his face. There was an awkward pause as he tried to process the combination of my pitiful gaze and the words I voiced. And then, only after a long moment of silence, did he finally understand what I was trying to say.He slowly turned red and his veins began to bulge as he slowly rose from zero to his boiling point over the course of a few seconds.“How dare you! Men, kill him! Lynch this impertinent peasant immediately!” he shouted indignantly.
“Huh?” I blinked a few times as I was overcome with surprise. “Wait, what? Why!?”What the hell!? All I did was point out the fact that his hair’s fucked! Is it really that much of a sore spot!? Like, come on, he has to know already! I wasn’t even trying to make fun of him! I literally put it as nicely as I could!As I was unable to get through to the bald guy, his lackeys immediately sprang up and began demonstrating their loyalty by coming at me. Although I was fairly panicked, I managed to evade their strikes and slowly retreat back towards the table I had been sitting at while raising my hands in a display of nonaggression.“Hold on, hear me out,” I said. “I wasn’t trying to make fun of you or anything. Just, looking at you makes me real sad. I couldn’t help but try and help you.”
“Do not let him escape under any circumstances! I’ll have you fed to the arena’s monsters if you dare!”
“Wait, why’d that make you even angrier!?”Understanding these youngsters and their short fuses is beyond an old man like me! Not that I’m actually old enough to really be justified in saying that kinda stuff, but whatever.“Geez! Why do you always have to be like this!?” shouted Nell.
“What do you mean!? How was that supposed to be insulting!? I was literally trying to help!”
“My Lord, I believe a… quick lesson is in order,” said Leila. “The man you addressed is a member of the muskle demon race. The helmets their ancestors wore in combat mandated such a hairstyle, and as such, it has been passed down as tradition. Many amongst them still wear it to this day.”
“Bruh. You serious?”
“As unfortunate as it is to say, My Lord, I am,” replied the maid. “Or as you would put it, ‘I’m totes serious bruh.’”Though modern slang wasn’t exactly what one could call prolific given the less than modern nature of the world I had reincarnated in, my frequent use of it had long allowed Leila to pick it up. Wait, so you’re telling me that he did that to himself because he wanted to? He actually wanted that cringy ass hairstyle? And he’s not balding!? You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me! Though, now that I think about it, topknots used to be a thing a few hundred years back. I mean, me and most other modern people would find them weird as hell, but samurai rocked that shit all the time. So yeah, with that in mind, french-braided twin tails on a balding man might not really be all that weird after all, huh?Only after a moment’s delay did I realize that I may or may not have done something that I shouldn’t. Yeah uhh… my bad. I’d totally be willing to apologize, but uh… he looks a biiiiiit too fired up for that, huh? Well, whatever the case, I can’t be backing down. It doesn’t look like he’s going to forgive me. I can’t just give up and let them do whatever either, since Leila’s here.The only choice I had left was to help the agitated group “calm down.” Yeah, I’mma do just that and uh… slowly “resolve the misunderstanding” once they’ve regained their cool.<– Prev — Next –>

Barfight — Part 2
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, JokerMan… I really need to stay out of other people’s business. I sighed internally as I dealt with the incoming attacks. I grabbed the first man’s fist as it flew towards my face and tugged it down and to the side. The sudden change in his momentum left him off balance and out of position. He wasn’t able to move quickly enough to avoid the punch that his friend had thrown in my direction.He groaned as the attack smashed itself into his face and sent him flying with so much force that he ended up plastered against one of the bar’s walls. It was a sight that I hadn’t really ever expected to see outside of manga and other forms of media, but as far as demon on demon combat was concerned, it was a pretty common sight. Their stats were just that inflated.“Miguel!” The man that had slugged his friend in the face clicked his tongue. “Damn it!”I used the fact that he was too agitated to act to tap him in the jaw while making sure to hold back just enough to avoid snapping his neck. The sudden shock to his brain stole the man’s consciousness and caused him to crumple to the floor in a sad but calm heap.Speaking of concussions, you know how everyone who’s had them says everything goes dark? Yeah, that’s actually pretty accurate. You can still see things, but you don’t know what it is you’re seeing. You can still hear your friends’ voices too, but you can’t really tell what they’re saying. It happened to me once when I was playing basketball with my buddies. Oh man, shit was spook.“Take this!”“Careful with that thing.”One of the men drew the knife he had dangling from his waist as I let my mind wander. He swung it at me, but I twisted my waist and avoided it before he could pierce my flank. I then struck his hand with my elbow and smashed him into a nearby table. The action was accompanied by a pair of sounds. Up first was a loud crunch, one that denoted my attack had crushed the bone in his hand. Following right after was the clattering of his knife as it fell to the ground.“You should know better than to use a blade in a street fight, dude. That shit could get someone hurt real bad,” I said.I walked over to him while he was still groaning in pain and calmed him down the same way I calmed his buddy down—I hit him in the jaw and knocked the living daylights out of him.“Don’t get cocky, asshole!” A third guy shouted as he approached me from behind.Glancing over, I found that he was trying to give me a big, warm hug. I wasn’t exactly all that keen on hugging it out with another guy, so I ducked to avoid it. Once I was clear, I grabbed him by the arms, rolled him over my back, and chucked him. The judo-like technique sent the man spiralling over the edge of the balcony. Gravity continued to speed him up until the moment his face smashed into one of the tables on the first floor. He screamed in pain as he made contact with all the plates, cutlery, and glassware. Only after a few moments of spasming and shouting did he finally “calm down.” O-oh shit. I was trying not to break anything, but uh, there goes that, I guess.“Damn, brother. You’re one helluva fighter!” said one of the other guests.
“An event as interesting as this one calls for another drink!” shouted another. “Barkeep, get me another mug!”I had been expecting those on the first floor to start panicking and screaming the moment the body suddenly fell on them. That, however, was quite literally the opposite of what happened. The other customers were only continuing to cheer and egg the fight on. Keyword: continuing.They had immediately gathered around and started playing the part of the peanut gallery the moment I had started talking to the guy with the messed up hairstyle. To the crowd, the fight was nothing but a source of entertainment, a side dish that happened to go well with their booze. I had at least expected the owner to care, but stopping the fight turned out to be the exact opposite of what the owner-cum-barkeeper had planned. Ever a merchant at heart, he had turned the opportunity into one to make bank by getting out his notebook and taking bets on the battle’s outcome.Even the band had bought into the situation. They switched from the nice relaxing tune they were playing to a livelier piece with a faster tempo. Holy shit, dude. Demons have balls. I guess this kinda stuff must happen so often around here that they’re just kinda used to it.My party stood out from the crowd. Unlike everyone else, they weren’t cheering or getting wasted. Leila and Enne were calmly observing the situation, whereas Nell and her mage buddy were a bit less so. Both were on guard. They had their hands on their weapons and were ready to draw them at a moment’s notice. Sorry for getting you guys involved in this. Especially if it ends up screwing with your plans and whatnot. Like, seriously. My bad.“How are you all so useless!?”The guy desperately in need of either a buzzcut or a wig clicked his tongue after watching each of his subordinates get taken down in turn. Having grown impatient, he decided to take matters into his own hands by tearing a leg off the table he was sitting at and entering the fight himself. His braids gently swayed back and forth as he lumbered over. Oh come on, man, what the hell? You can’t just break stuff like that. Don’t blame me if the owner sends a hefty bill or two your way, alright?Contemplating the relative cost of a table led me to recall that Braidy was the son of a duke. To him, the table in question was likely nothing more than chump change. I, on the other hand, was actually in trouble. I had broken both a table and a bunch of tableware. Welp. Here’s to hoping the demon king’ll cover for me.“Fine. I’ll make you regret running your mouth myself!” shouted Braidy. “And unlike those miserable weaklings, I’ll make you atone for your insults with death!”
“Man, come on. It was just a misunderstanding and I already said sorry,” I said. “How about I treat you to some food and booze and we call it a day?”
“Shut up! Before I make you!”The man had literally no intention of even trying to listen to me. He disregarded my attempts at making peace and immediately leapt into a running tackle.I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. Ughhhh. This is starting to piss me off. Come the fuck on… What the hell dude, I’ve already apologized, and I’ve even offered to try and make up for it. What more do you want from me? Like, I know that you value your traditions and that they’re really important to you because you were brought up with them. And I know that they came from a time where bloodshed was normal, so you’re a little bit quick to jump the gun. But like, I’ve already tried defusing the situation. And the only reason it isn’t working is because your dumb ass isn’t listening to me. Let me guess. You must be the type of retard that is never satisfied unless you get to beat the shit out of everyone that you don’t agree with, so you’re not going to let up or shut up until I let you sock my face in. Fucking moron.More and more resentment started to build up within me as I tried considering Braidy’s perspective. But his stupidity failed to make up even half the reason I was as angry and annoyed as I was. The larger issue at hand was the one that had driven me to speak with him in the first place.“Fuck! I can’t take this anymore! Fuck this! There’s so much wrong with that stupid looking hairdo you’ve got that I don’t even know where to fucking start!” I dodged his charge, grabbed one of the stupid braids on the side of his head, and gave it a forceful yank as he passed by.“My hair! My hair!! The pain!” He cried in anguish as the combined force of his momentum and my “attack” caused one of his braids to tear right off, hair roots and all.
“What the ever-loving fuck is wrong with you!? What kind of man braids his goddamn hair in the fucking first place!? Have you seen how stupid it looks when you fucking move? It sways! It fucking sways! You know how disgusting that is!? Fuck you! Fuck you for wanting this! Fuck! You! I feel like a fucking moron for even trying to sympathize!”
“Is it just me, or did he just have a total sudden change in attitude with absolutely no hesitation!?” Nell made a retort from the corner of the second floor that everyone had evacuated to.
“Ughh…” Braidy groaned as he rubbed the place where his hair had been just a few moments prior. “H-how dare you! How dare you do that to my hair!?”
“Shut up, retard!” I shouted. “You know what, fine! If you like this stupid looking hair so much, then you can have it right the fuck back!”I opened up my palm and shoved the hair I’d torn off of him back on his mouth.“And get the fuck out of here while you’re at it!” I spun around and gave him a good old roundhouse kick to the face as I continued to complain. “I don’t want to see you or your gross ass hairdo ever again!”The force of the blow caused him to go flying over the edge of the balcony. He tried to right himself in midair, but hit the ground before he could. The impact knocked him out cold and caused him to go limp.“Well boys, this match is over!!” I wasn’t sure exactly when we had gotten ourselves a commentator, but one of the bar’s patrons had apparently stepped up to the plate. “The winner is… the challenger!”His words caused all the drunks present to break into a series of cheers. I, on the other hand, was still in the middle of complaining about the idiots I had just finished dealing with. Ughhhh… That was a pain in the ass.“He’s over here!”Correction: the idiots I had thought I was done dealing with.The shout almost seemed to function as a cue. A large group of mean looking men suddenly flooded into the bar.“The idiot up there is the one that thought he could get away with picking a fight with the boss! Get him and kick his ass!” The man barking orders was the first I had thrown off the balcony. He had apparently gone to get backup while I wasn’t looking.His orders caused all the other grunts that joined him to momentarily look in my direction before marching towards the stairs. Oh greaaaaaat. Seconds! Yeah, I totally ordered those. Siiiiiiigh… Well, I mean it is actually my fault this time. I guess I’ll make up for my mistake by making sure I have all these new friends of mine get sent right home, I guess. Haaaaaaaahh…I stepped forward in order to dive right back into the fray, only to find that I didn’t need to. The bar’s other customers had already moved up and gotten in the punks’ way. Though many of them were drunk, their eyes seemed to brim with a sort of wild enthusiasm.“Come on boys, you ain’t new to this. This may be a brawl, but it’s still got rules,” said one of the bar’s customers.
“If you want him, then you’re going to have to go through us first,” added another.
“W-What the hell kinda beef you have with us!?” asked one of the confused punks.
“It isn’t beef,” laughed a drunk. “But did you seriously think we could just sit around after watching a fight like that? Hell no! Our blood’s boiling, brother! And our fists are itching for a go!”
“Oh, hell no! No way I’m letting you get a march on me! These punks are mine!”
“Damned drunks!” The punks seemed to falter in the face of the raw enthusiasm emanated by the crowd.The situation was an odd one to behold. I couldn’t help but feel as if the drunks were actually the bad guys, and the punks were the protagonists given that one group was just trying to be loyal, and the other was actively getting in their way for naught but their own selfish desires. But whatever the case, the results remained the same. The two groups ultimately ended up clashing in a massive melee.It was a mess. People punched each other, kicked each other, grappled each other, and threw each other all over the place. And it wasn’t as if the bar’s customers had actually stopped drinking either. They kept pouring liquor down their throats and smashing the empty bottles against the people they were fighting. There was even a pair of guys going around grabbing punks and literally removing them from the store by chucking them out the front door.The already lively atmosphere, filled with shouts and laughter, was only emphasized further by the band. They had shifted to playing another fast, upbeat song in light of the situation. Dude. What the hell? Is this supposed to be a bar owned by pirates or something?“So what exactly are we supposed to do about all this?” asked Nell.The hero and I were standing by the second floor’s balcony and looking down on the mess below. Rather, that was what I was doing. She was instead taking the opportunity to stare at me reproachfully. You ask me, who do I ask? Like, seriously. Iunno.“…” I paused for a moment to contemplate the alternatives. “What do you say we just get the hell outta here?”
“Huh!? You’re just going to leave!?” She was completely taken aback by the fact that I was just going to avoid resolving the situation despite being responsible for causing it.
“Hey, barkeep!” I didn’t bother answering her. I instead turned towards the bar’s owner, who was situated downstairs, and shouted in his direction. “I’m going to leave what I owe you for food and drink over here! Have the guys that got their asses beat in pay for the tables and shit!”
“Sure thing, brother! And good job kicking those brats faces in! Made my day, right there!” he shouted back as he smashed an empty bottle into a random nearby punk and broke into a cackle. “You’re always welcome here, so I’ll hope to see ya soon!”Oh, great. Even the barkeeper thinks I was just out for a fight. I know it might’ve seemed like it, but I really wasn’t trying to mess with them or anything. That was all just a huge misunderstanding…For a moment, I felt awful. All Braidy and his buddies wanted was to go out and have a meal somewhere, but they were subjected to a horrible experience the moment they arrived at their destination. Some random guy came up to them, made fun of their boss, and beat them all black and blue. Wow uh… yeah, that makes me sound like a terrible person, doesn’t it? Yeah, yeah, I know. I did something that I maybe, okay, fine, definitely shouldn’t have. But whatever. Fuck it, I don’t care anymore. I’m a fucking demon lord. Why the hell do I care about what other people want or think? I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. Well, with a few caveats since I basically got myself collared and whipped, but whatever. Doesn’t change shit. If people start trying to hit me, I’ll hit them right back. And if they don’t like that, well too fucking bad. It obviously isn’t my fault. It’s always either theirs or just a case of bad luck. Screw feeling bad about it.“Alright girls, let’s get back to the castle. It doesn’t really look like we can get through the door anymore since uh… yeah. So what do you say we take that instead?” I asked as I pointed to one of the windows on the second floor.
“My Lord, I believe a bit of a chat is in order upon our return. Do make some time for it,” said Leila with an intimidating smile.
“U-Uhh… don’t be too hard on me, alright…?” I could feel myself wince in response to the maid’s dreadful aura. Oh boy. “I can’t wait!”
“Uhm, Yuki? That’s a window,” said Nell. “How are we supposed to leave through a window?”
“What do you mean how? A window’s still an exit. You can pretty much use it the same way you use everything else,” I said before turning towards the pair I was travelling with. “Mind if I borrow you two for a moment to demonstrate?”
“Okay,” said Enne.
“Please feel free,” said Leila.The window was already open, so I beckoned the girls over as I approached it. Once we were all accounted for, I picked up Enne in my arms and grabbed her sword form with the same hand. I wrapped my other arm around Leila’s waist, placed a foot on the windowsill, and leapt right out. The cool evening air rushed by as I experienced a moment of freefall.I bent my knees right before I landed in order to direct the force into the ground before standing up and putting both girls down.“See? Perfectly fine,” I said as I turned to face the window. “Now come on, jump! I’ll catch you!”
“Uhhh… I don’t really know if I wa—Wait! Ronia!?”Nell looked on hesitantly and even fought back against the idea, but she was the only one. Ms. Court Mage stepped onto the windowsill and leapt out without a moment’s hesitation. And she did more than just that. She had jumped out in a way that had left her sideways; she was sure to smash her face right into the ground if I failed to catch her. Damn. She’s got guts.I grabbed her out of the air before slowly letting her down.“Thanks.”
“No problem,” I said. “Well, just you now, Nell.”
“Ughh…Fine” she groaned hesitantly before finally assenting. “O-okay! Here goes nothing!”Though her stats were high enough to prevent any injuries even in the case that she fell, she still seemed a bit unwilling given the fact that she was literally jumping out of a two story building, so she closed her eyes, took a moment to muster up as much courage as she could, and jumped.I gently caught her in my arms as one would a damsel in distress. I had one arm under her thighs and another supporting her back.“See? I told you you’d be fine.”
“Y-Yeah. Thanks,” she said. “Wait! Why am I thanking you!? You’re the reason I had to do this in the first place!”
“Yeaaaaaaah. Can’t say I’m not. My bad.”
“Don’t you worry, Nell,” said Leila. “My Lord and I are going to have a nice, long discussion about his decisions as soon as we return.”
“Thank you, Leila,” replied the hero. “I hope you’ll finally be able to drill some common sense into that thick skull of his.”
“Oh, come on, girls. I already said I’m sorry. I could really do without the lecture.” I forced a bit of a smile as I let the hero down.
“Aw…” said a disappointed Nell.
“Aw what?”
“N-nothing! Just pretend that never happened!” said the hero. “Anyway, do you think that meeting here is still a good idea after all that?”
“Hmmm…” I deliberated for a moment. “Yeah, I think so. It’s the only place we both know. I mean, I’m sure it’d be easy for you to find us if you just hit up the castle, but you don’t really know enough people to arrange for anything like that yet, right?”
“Not yet. I’m pretty sure that we would be able to make peace with the demon realm’s king based off of what you and Leila have told us,” said Nell. “In fact, we might even be able to forge an alliance. But that’s not a decision I’m authorized to make, so I’d prefer to stay away from the castle for now.”
“Yeah, then I guess this is pretty much the only place we can meet up. I mean, we don’t actually have to go inside if you don’t want to. We could always just use it as a rendezvous point and head somewhere else after.”
“Okay,” said Nell. “Then I guess I’ll see you later, Yuki! I’ll make sure I use the orbs you gave me to get in touch if anything ever happens!”
“Yeah, feel free,” I said. “See ya.”With our farewells said, Leila, Enne, and I made our way back to the demon king’s castle.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: The Return Trip
Editors: Sebas Tian, Speedphoenix, Joker“Geez…” Nell heaved a sigh as she and Ronia walked under the moonlit sky. “Yuki sure loves causing trouble.”The path to their destination, the inn they were staying at, was kept lit both by the stars and by the magical items placed along the side of the road. The dim, faint illumination led to the creation of a wondrous atmosphere. So beautiful it was that it looked like a scene straight out of a painting, a cityscape torn directly from an artist’s mind.Neither girl seemed to be paying much attention to their surroundings. They looked completely off guard, and in their minds, they were. But both had been trained so well that they didn’t even notice the fact that they were unconsciously scanning the backdrop for any signs of danger. The pair was sure to notice should they be tailed or approached.“He’s always doing the craziest of things,” complained Nell. “I don’t think he even knows what common sense is.”
“But you still seem to be enjoying yourself,” said Ronia suspiciously. “Especially for someone with so many complaints.”The mage’s response stemmed from the look on her friend’s face. Her words had been sour, but her smile told a different story altogether.“D-do I really?” Nell’s voice quivered as she responded to her sleepy-sounding friend.
“Were you really that happy to see him?”
“Y-yeah,” the hero. “He’s really strong. I didn’t expect to see him here, but knowing he is is reassuring.”
“He’s that strong?”
“Mhm. He was always really strong. I’m not really sure why, but now he seems even stronger. I don’t think I would be able to put up much of a fight against him anymore, no matter how hard I tried,” said Nell with a nod.The claim caused Ronia to give the other girl a look of disbelief. The scuffle in the bar had proven to her that the man was strong. But she couldn’t believe that he was even stronger than the person walking at her side. It was no exaggeration to say that Nell was one of humanity’s finest. Only the strongest orichalcum adventurers were able to match her. And that was in spite of the fact that she had yet to reach her peak. Nell was still growing into her role. She would only get stronger.It was commonly understood that demons, the demon realm’s inhabitants, were more powerful than humans. They were much more capable of exerting brute force, be it physical or magical. But that wasn’t to say that humanity was doomed, for the human race had technology and technique. It was by no means strictly inferior.With all that in mind, Ronia knew that Nell was strong enough to hold her own, even here in the demon realm. And yet, she claimed that she couldn’t hold a candle to the man the two of them had just met. Though none present had made the man’s race known, it was obvious that the man was no human. He had to be a demon, and one of the realm’s most powerful at that.That was only one of the many facts that the mage had deduced. The conversation he had with Nell had been riddled with clues detailing his identity. And Ronia had already finished putting them together. One of the most significant bits of information was that the two spoke of a girl named Lady Iryll. Ronia knew: there was only a single Iryll in all of Allysia that even the hero would think to address by title.This meant that the man named Yuki was not only stronger than a literal hero, but also acquainted with one of the country’s most important VIPs. And that was enough to tell her that he had most likely been the man that had put an end to the prince’s rebellion, the mysterious, masked entity that had shown up in the capital a month prior, only to vanish as quickly as he had come.Unveiling his identity revealed the reason it had been kept a secret. Ronia now understood exactly why the king had kept his mouth shut and his lips sealed whenever he was asked for more information. It was because he was a demon. The fact that a demon had saved Alshir was one that could never be revealed; public outcry was sure to ensue should it ever come to light. Allysia would once again be plunged into a state of instability despite only just having been restored to order. Likewise, there was a chance that the church could suffer if it was known that Nell, the hero, was on friendly terms with a demon.Ronia herself didn’t particularly mind, however. Her friend was willing to trust him in spite of his race, and she too saw no reason not to do the same. There was a chance that the rest of their allies might not think the same, but there was no need to tell them everything. All the others needed to know was that they had found someone willing to cooperate. And that was probably all they wanted to know about the individual in question anyway. There was little chance they would ask for too many details.“Was that really the only reason?” Ronia pressed the other girl for answers. She highly doubted that the man’s strength alone would have caused Nell to respond in the manner she had.
“D-did I really look that happy?”
“I think so.”Ronia could easily tell that, while Nell really had felt reassured by the man’s presence and willingness to help, there was much more than just that to it. The look in her eyes had been filled with affection, with a longing that could only be described as love.“I see…”Nell tried to force a smile, but it came out in a way that put her embarrassment on display. The truth of the matter was that she was overjoyed by the unexpected encounter. She saw him as an absurd and selfish man whose thoughts and ideals were entirely beyond comprehension. The event that had occurred within the bar was a perfect example of exactly what that meant to her. Though it was entirely his fault, Yuki had suddenly and inexplicably changed his mind, pinned the fault on the man he had verbally assaulted, and rendered all of his assailants unconscious.The people he fought weren’t the best behaved. They were hot-blooded, and there was a chance that the events that followed his insults may have very well unfolded regardless of whether or not he had initiated them. But whatever the case, the fact was that the fault lay with him and not any other.It was unreasonable. He was unreasonable. But that was a part of why she found it so entertaining to be around him. With him around, there was never a quiet moment. There was always something going on.She felt like it was almost as if something was drawing her to him. She didn’t know whether it was because of something to do with his abilities as a demon lord, or whether it was something that originated from the person in question. But she did know that, like her, the goat-horned girl and the girl he called his daughter felt the exact same way.And so did the girl that he had married.It had finally happened.She had always known that the two were perfectly compatible despite their propensity to argue. And as the thought passed through her mind, so did a pain through her chest. But she shook it off. She chased the thought out of her mind as she spoke to the other girl in what she believed to be an energetic tone.“That’s just because he’s fun to be around. I’m sure you’ll know exactly what I mean if you spend enough time with him,” she said. “Now let’s hurry up and get back to the inn. I’m sure everyone else is already on their way back too.”With that said, Nell once again began to “happily” walk along the side of the road.“…Okay” Ronia paused for a moment before assenting. Her friend seemed to think that she had hidden her emotions away. But the mage saw right through her. Ronia opened her mouth to speak, but she didn’t know what she was supposed to say to the other girl, nor how she was supposed to say it. The only thing she could muster was to agree to follow the other girl back to their temporary residence.<– Prev — Next –>

The Operation Begins
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerA meeting between a certain pair of individuals began as Yuki ran amok in town. One sat atop the throne reserved only for the lord of the demon realm while the other genuflected before him in an expression of subservience.“Well, Haloria?” The king addressed his servant. “What did you make of him?”
“Yuki is an odd man, my king,” responded the agent. “Travelling with him has taught me that he is nothing if not inconsistent and bizarre.”
“And what, precisely, is that supposed to mean?” The unexpected answer caused the king to cock an eyebrow in interest.
“Like many other demon lords with dungeons at their disposal, he is confident in his martial prowess. However, to my knowledge, it doesn’t appear as if he is drunk on power. Unlike others of his kind, he remains fully rational. This is something that can easily be seen in the way he treats those that he holds dear. He appears to be rather intelligent as well, as evidenced by how easily he saw through your words and read your intentions. Despite seeming smart, however, he completely skimped on negotiations. He thoughtlessly went along with your suggestions without even bothering to question them,” said Haloria. “In summary, My King, both the retention of his rationality and the disparities in the level of his intelligence lead me to believe that he is a man of many contradictions.”
“Putting it like that certainly does make it seem that way,” chuckled Phynar. His subordinate’s observations had him quite amused.
“I believe that the issue may stem from his outlook on life. It is so different from my own that I cannot see him as anything but strange.”
“I can see that. I guess the best way to summarize your observations would be to say that his values differ from ours. The only way we can really understand him would be to change the way we think.” Phynar put a hand on his chin as he spoke. “He doesn’t act like any of the other demon lords I’ve met. Not even those that were of the demon race were nearly as eccentric. He’s so different from everything else in this world that I’m tempted to think he might have come from another.”Little did Phynar know, his conjecture had hit the nail on the head.“Surely you jest, My King.”
“I suppose I do,” laughed the blonde.A shadow approached the two individuals situated in the throne room as they continued to converse.“My King, I have returned. The stage is set, and my mission is complete.” The hooded man spoke in a respectful tone no different from Haloria’s. “I have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that our newfound collaborator is now free to take action at any point in time.”
“So it’s done? Did it all go as smoothly as expected?”
“Of course, My King. Everything is as per your orders. Our collaborators can expect to take action in relative safety.”
“Great. I wouldn’t want him to turn on us because we can’t keep our promises,” smiled Phynar. “In fact, I’d like him to continue working with us even after all this. I’m going to be counting on you to make sure everything goes as planned.”
“I understand. I will ensure that his experience remains positive,” said the hooded figure. “I do have one other thing to report.”
“And what would that be?”
“The demon lord has made contact with humanity’s hero. The two appeared to have met in a bar. Do you have any further instructions?”
“Humanity’s hero? Oh, you must be talking about the girl you mentioned in the report you made the other day. I’d say that you probably don’t need to worry about it. He did know he was being watched, right?”
“I believe so.” The king’s subordinate nodded. “We happened to make eye contact. He stared right at me even though I was supposed to have been hidden.”
“Then it should be a-okay. That was probably just his way of telling you that he thinks it’s okay for us to know that they’ve made contact,” said the king, cheerfully. “Besides, her enemies are our enemies. Sharing enemies doesn’t immediately make us allies, but it does mean that our foes will be worse off. And that, that is something I appreciate. I believe that it’s safe to leave things as they are. Let Yuki deal with her. I’m sure that whatever he has in mind will be to our benefit.”
“Understood, My King.”The subordinate bowed, which led Phynar to nod in satisfaction.“Thank you for the report,” said the king. “If all the preparations are complete, then I suppose I’ll send for him tomorrow and tell him what it is I’m going to have him do.”***“Well, Yuki? What do you think of participating in a martial arts tournament?”The demon king called me in for another audience the day after Leila sat me down and nagged my ear off. He was situated on the throne with the same big smile on his face as always.“A martial arts tournament?” I asked, skeptically.
“Mhm! That’s right! It’s a huge event. All of the demon realm’s proudest warriors gather to show off their strength and compete to be named the strongest. It only lasts a few days, but it’s still considered one of the most important events that the capital is home to. It livens up the city the same way any other festival would.”
“So it’s basically a festival? That sounds fun.”I paused for a moment to contemplate the possibilities. There’ll probably be food stalls all over the place, which means Enne’ll be in for a treat. Literally. But uh… so people come from all over just to “show off their strength?” Yeah, that sounds like a… mild way to put it. Iunno about you but that sounds downplayed as fuck. I’m pretty sure the whole thing is just going to end up as a bunch of violent fights where people try to almost kill each other.“The fiend faction is participating. They’re dispatching some of their finest warriors in order to demonstrate their strength and gain public support. That’s where you come in. I want you to not only crush them, but also stand out as much as you can. I want you to win first place and take home the title of the demon realm’s most powerful combatant.”
“Look… I know that sounds pretty simple on paper and whatnot, and I don’t really want to throw a wrench in your plans or anything. But, just sayin’, I’m not exactly the greatest fighter. I mean, I’m pretty decent and I’m not about to just fall over. I’m totally fine with chewing bubblegum and kicking ass and all that, but I can’t say for sure that I’ll be able to win. Especially if I don’t really know what I’m going to be up against.”While I wasn’t the worst fighter, I only really knew how to brawl. I was more or less incapable of approaching any sort of combat scenario with anything but brute force. I could use a sword and I could cast magic, but I relied much more on my stats than I did any sort of technique. I was fairly confident that I would be able to easily destroy anyone else that relied purely on power, but I had no confidence in taking down martial masters that spent their lives perfecting the finest details of their craft. Ehhh, you know what? If I end up stuck against someone like that, then I’ll just fly around and bombard them with magic from up high. Obviously won’t work if they’ve got wings too, which is uh… bad. I don’t really have a plan B right now, but fuck it. I’m sure I’ll figure something out if push comes to shove.“I’m sure it will be just fine,” said the king. “I made use of my authority and had all the other participants examined at the time of your registration. You should be the strongest of the bunch.”Wow. Talk about abuse of authority. Dude’s literally doing whatever he wants.“There happen to be a few individuals you might want to pay a bit more attention to, but we’ll tell you everything you need to know about them a bit later. We have their weapons and their styles documented already, so you don’t have to worry.”
“Thanks. So I’m guessing you guys will be working behind the scenes while I do all this shit and get their attention up front?”
“You sure are quick on the uptake,” laughed the demon king. “Oh yes, that’s right. I believe you said you were planning on wearing a mask?”
“Yeah, what about it?”
“Then I suggest you take this.” The king handed me a ring.
“What’s this thing supposed to be?”
“Why, it’s an accessory, of course,” he said. “It is enchanted with the ability to allow you to change your hair and eye colours at will. You’re free to keep it even after you finish helping me, if you’d like.”The first thing I did was analyze the item and check its stats.***
Ring of Transfiguration
Quality: A+
Description: Pouring magical energy into this ring allows its bearer to freely change the colour of their eyes and hair.
***Long story short, it was a handy little high-performance tool that would allow me to better my disguise. Hair and eye colour weren’t exactly things that one could readily change under normal circumstances. Most would probably assume that whatever hair and eye colour they saw me with was natural.“Cool. Thanks.”I put the magically enchanted item on one of the fingers on my left hand. Of course, I made sure to avoid my ring finger, which was already decorated by the gift I had gotten from Lefi. Alright, let’s give this thing a whirl. I should probably make it a totally different colour from usual to add to the effect. Something really bright and eye-catching would probably work best.With a few criteria in mind, I began thinking of different colours before finally arriving at a conclusion. I focused on the one I ended up choosing and began channelling my magical energies through the ring. A faint bit of mana coursed through my eyes and hair. And as it received, my transformation found itself complete.“Huh… neat” I looked myself over in the mirror brought to me by one of the maids in the demon king’s employ. My black hair and my red and black odd-eyes were both gone. Everything had instead been dyed silver. Yeah, this’ll work. This plus my fake stats’ll make it pretty damn hard for people to figure out who I really am.The serious contemplation I was in the midst of was interrupted by a giggle. I turned away from the mirror and spun around in order to look at Leila, its source. The sheep-horned demon had an even bigger smile on her face than usual.“What?”
“I’m sorry, My Lord. I couldn’t help myself,” she said whilst stifling another snicker. “Your hair matches Lefi’s quite well, I must say.”Only after Leila’s remark did I come to realize the implications of my decision. All I had wanted was a bright colour. I could have picked anything else. Blonde, red, and orange were all within the realm of possibility. And yet, I had picked silver. And it wasn’t just that. I had subconsciously picked the exact shade of silver that Lefi’s hair shone in.“Uhhh… So, just saying, this wasn’t intentional. I just wanted something that stood out. And this is just how it ended up. I wasn’t actually trying to make myself look like Lefi or anything, alright?”
“Of course, My Lord. I totally understand.”Although Leila claimed that she caught my drift, the way she was looking at me made it obvious that she really hadn’t. Please cease and desist. You’re making me feel all awkward.“Anyways.” I faked a cough, drained the ring of its mana, and changed my hair back to its default colour before turning to face the demon king. “As I was saying, I hear you loud and clear. I’ll do what I can to nab first place. So when exactly is this tournament thing happening anyway?”
“It’s set to start in five days. I’m sure you have some last-minute training to do, so I’ve prepared the parade grounds for you. Please feel free to use them.”Training? Yeah uh, I’ve kinda never actually practiced martial arts or anything. Like, tell me to train all you want, but I’m not actually going to get anything done since I kinda don’t know what I’m even supposed to be doing. Oh wait, I got an idea. I’ll come up with some flashy looking spell that goes with the whole festival mood the city’ll have going for it. Yeah, that actually sounds pretty nice. I’mma do it. Oh, oh, another idea. I could totally make it into a combination spell, one that’s actually a bunch of smaller spells weaved together into a combo. You know, it’ll be like setting things up in a P*kemon Contest for extra points. Yeah, you know what? I’m really starting to look forward to this whole martial arts tournament thing. And just to be clear, it’s not because I’ll be working to further King Faggot’s agenda. It’s time to show the masses what a demon lord can really do.<– Prev — Next –>

The Arena
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerMy surroundings were filled with naught but noise. The streets were crowded, and the people that filled them continued to shout and laugh as they basked in the city’s celebratory atmosphere.“Wow…” Enne, whose hand I held, opened her eyes wide as we moved through the city. She was so impressed by how lively it was that she couldn’t help but raise her voice in admiration.
“I know, right? Seems like the king was right. This place is looking pretty festival-like right about now,” I said in a tone indicative of my good mood.The demon realm’s capital was bustling with so much energy that a single glance was enough for me to feel the excitement radiating from its people. As could be assumed from the sight that lay before us, it had been five days since I spoke to the demon king about what I was going to do for him.We had finished getting everything ready and set out in order to make our way over to the arena. As we had already spent a decent amount of time wading our way through the streets, we were already almost there. One of the things I had noticed was that every single person that had ventured out of their homes was wearing either a smile or some other expression of joy and excitement. This, of course, included more than just the people wandering the streets. Those looking to profit off of them felt the same way. Countless stalls had been opened up by aspiring and established entrepreneurs alike. The shopkeepers advertised their products by shouting at everyone that walked by. Their merry cries only served to add to the already vibrant atmosphere.I had sensed a gradual buildup over the past few days. The capital had slowly gotten noisier as more people rolled in. But today, today was different. Everyone’s excitement had suddenly spiked all at once. A part of me was surprised. I had thought that the demon realm was in a situation that wouldn’t have allowed for its people to kick back and relax the way they did. But apparently, I was wrong. And I was fine with that. As far as I was concerned, this was just how festivals had to be.Logically speaking, it did make sense. Unlike the world I used to live in, this one was suffering from a severe lack of entertainment. People were starved for it. Events like this one were so rare, so few and far between that everyone who was anyone would do their best to enjoy them.“Does that mean you’ve taken part in festivals before, My Lord?”
“Errr, kinda.”I gave a vague, non-committal answer while smiling to gloss the topic over before turning towards the agent left in charge of us and asking her a question. “So, Agent McH-, er, Haloria, what exactly did you say we needed to do again?”“You need to speak with the arena’s staff and complete your registration at the front desk. Unfortunately, we are unable to exert our influence on the tournament itself, so we have no idea as to who you will be fighting. Match placement is completely random, and the event’s staff will be responsible for guiding you through the rest of the process.”
“Alright, works. And I think you guys said something about the preliminaries being like some sort of battle royale or something?”
“That is correct,” said Haloria. “It is a fifty person free for all. The last three left standing are permitted to participate in the rest of the tournament. With your strength, surviving the preliminaries should be a breeze.”Welp. Time to give it my all and see where it gets me.“Some of our subordinates have mingled in with the tournament’s staff. We will be happy to assist you, so please ring the bell you were given whenever you wish to call for us. Someone will see to you as soon as possible.”
“You’re talking about the bell that doesn’t actually make any noise when I ring it, right?”Like the ring, the bell I was given was an item imbued with magical properties. It wasn’t capable of carrying out a regular bell’s primary feature, but it could release mana at a very specific frequency. Man, the demon king sure does have a whole bunch of cool stuff. Though I guess it’s only natural seeing as how he’s literally in charge of a whole country.We spent a few more minutes walking and talking as we moved down the main street before finally arriving at the arena. The building was large, round, and for some odd reason, reminded me of the baseball stadiums we had back on Earth. The town had been noisy. But the stadium was even noisier. There were tonnes of people packed into the area. Though some of them were armed, they were all standing in neat lines. Man, seeing people with their weapons and armour out standing around all civilized and shit is pretty weird. Seriously. This shit’s surreal as fuck.Standardization apparently wasn’t something that demons cared much for. People were holding all sorts of different weapons. One example was a broom with its bristles replaced with needles, and another was a scythe with a hammer on the other end of its snath. It was almost as if each race had its own unique selection of equipment; the line was filled with all sorts of different people wearing and holding all sorts of different things. All in all, the resulting scene almost appeared to be chaotic and disorganized in nature despite the orderly line the warriors stood in. Is this really supposed to be a martial arts tournament? Looks more like a weapons exhibition or trade show to me. Not that I’ve really got the right to actually say anything seeing as how I’ve got myself a Japanese-style sword with a big ass blade.“Oh yeah, I should probably get myself disguised before I see the receptionist, huh?” I said. “Sorry Leila, but I’m going to have to ditch you. Make sure you use the thing I gave you to get yourself back to the dungeon if something happens.” I reminded her of the necklace in an indirect manner in order to throw off any would-be eavesdroppers.
“Of course, My Lord,” nodded the maid in understanding.Unfortunately, we couldn’t be seen together in public after I put on my disguise in order to stop people from making the connection between me and the alter ego I had devised for the sake of the operation.“Well, Haloria, it looks like it’s going to have to be your job to keep Leila safe while I’m out. I know she’s kinda famous and whatnot, so make sure no one ends up bugging her too much, alright?”
“Don’t worry, you will be leaving her in good hands,” said the secret agent. “I’ll keep her safe even if it means putting my life on the line.”Her words caused a sweatdrop to appear on the back of my head. Yeah uh… she’s totally just going to warp out if she gets into any trouble, so you should also probably focus on getting yourself to safety.“That looks like it would probably be a good spot to change.” The agent pointed me to a piece of cover I could probably use to get out of sight. I followed her prompt and headed over with Enne whilst checking my surroundings both by looking at my map and by actively focusing on my enemy detection skill. Only after I was completely sure that we were out of sight did I make use of the Ring of Transfiguration and grab the mask I had stored away in my inventory.My new mask was quite different from the one I had worn back when I was helping the humans. This one didn’t so much resemble a clown as it did the mask worn by the molecular manipulator known as the black reaper. Oh wait, it’s missing the thunderbolt that’s supposed to be running through one of the eyes.Leaving the mask as nothing but a blank slate with eyeholes and a fake mouth made it seem a bit too creepy for my tastes, so I ended up embedding a random star-shaped gem just under its left eyehole. Like basically every other fancy thing I had picked up in the demon realm, it was something I had gotten from its king. He had casually handed it to me without a care in the world the moment I asked for it. Man, Iunno if it’s just me, but he seems hella loaded.Like everything else I made with Weapon Transmutation, the mask was a weapon. Technically speaking, it was a boomerang, just a dysfunctional one. I could totally throw it at someone and use it to hurt them, but it probably wouldn’t ever turn around, let alone come back. Not that it really matters. I’m probably never actually going to throw this thing, so yeah.While the clown mask came in a pair, I only had one reaper mask. I didn’t make a second with the mouth area exposed this time around because it wasn’t necessary for me to keep the artificial face on at all times.“Okay, looks like I’m just about ready to be seen in public.” I said before turning to the sword girl by my side. “I’m sorry you have to miss the festival, Enne. How about I make it up to you by letting you pick what we do in the evening?”
“Okay,” nodded the kimono-clad weapon. “And I don’t mind, Master. Anything is okay as long as we’re together.”She spoke a series of words that made me extremely happy whilst allowing the slightest bit of shyness to tinge upon her usually expressionless face. Ermagawd. Isn’t she just the cutest thing ever? That’s a rhetorical question, by the way. Don’t actually answer it.“Thanks, Enne. I like spending time with you too.” I smiled and patted her on the head as I spoke. “Could you do me a favour and go back to possessing your main body?”
“Okay.” She nodded and touched the weapon I held in front of her. And as she did, she disappeared. It almost looked like she had fused with it the moment she and it made contact.I hoisted her over my shoulders and sighed after confirming that the process was over. “Welp. Leggo.”***I arrived at the desk after sitting through the line. There, I was greeted by a receptionist that seemed to belong to one of the demonic races—she had both a tail and a pair of horns. “Good morning, sir. If you’re here to complete the signup process, then please present the document you were given at the time of your initial registration.”I handed her the card that served as the proof of my registration.“Please give me just one second to confirm the details.” The receptionist paused to look over the documents. She stopped each time she went over a major detail and asked me to confirm it. “To sum things up, Mr. Ypsilon, you were born here in Regighihegg, and your weapon of choice is the greatsword? Would the weapon you have mounted on your back be the greatsword in question? That’s quite the impressive blade. It says here that you’re participating on the king’s recommendation. Is that correct?”I nodded in response to each of her inquiries. Ypsilon was, of course, the pseudonym I had chosen for the operation. Yeap, you got it. It’s just the letter Y again, but in like German or something this time.“Great. I look forward to seeing you in action then,” she said. “The last step in the registration process will be for you to channel your magical energy through your ID card. Could you please do so to confirm your identity?”I did as she said and cycled my mana through the card in order to make it glow to confirm that I was in fact Ypsilon. Man, these are some in-depth checks.Contrary to my expectations, the checks they ran at the gate weren’t actually anywhere near as half-assed as I had expected. I had thought that it would be fine to have a proxy finish up the registration process on behalf of the actual participant, but it seemed that I was wrong. My impression stemmed from the initial registration. I had been allowed to fill in all sorts of fake details, and no one had been any the wiser. Though now that I think about it, that might’ve just been because the demon king was pulling the strings behind the scenes. I mean, I already know that he’s not doing this the legit way. He seemed way too confident in his intel for that. Especially when he was telling me about all the guys I had to watch out for.“Thank you very much for your patience. Your registration is now complete,” said the receptionist as she handed me a wooden, rectangular block the size of a stick of lip balm. “You will be contestant number 113. Please make sure not to forget or lose your number. We will be calling it when it is your turn to fight. The waiting room is just over there. A member of our team will be waiting at the end of the corridor in order to provide you with further instructions. Thank you again, and good luck, Mr. Ypsilon.”I raised a hand to thank the bowing receptionist before leaving the overly crowded entranceway and heading down the corridor the receptionist had pointed at. The area meant for fighters was separate from the area reserved for spectators, so I was finally given a break from the crowd.After following the path for a bit, I eventually ran into a middle-aged man who looked to be one of the event’s employees.“Good morning sir. You have arrived at a waiting area reserved for the tournament’s fighters,” he said in a professional-sounding tone. “Would you happen to be here to compete?”I answered him by nodding and showing off the card and the numbered stick.“Excellent. All of the rooms in this area are waiting rooms. The ones with red “no vacancy” signs hanging in front of them are already at their max capacity, so you will not be allowed to enter them. However, you are free to pick any room that is not fully occupied.”Well then. And here I thought I was going to be getting a private room. Though I guess it kinda makes sense. The preliminaries exist just to cut down the number of participants. It’s literally a battle royale. They’re not going to have enough rooms to give everyone their own private quarters.“This place… is interesting.” Enne spoke to me telepathically as I headed down the corridor.
“Right,” I chuckled. “This is the first time you’ve ever been anywhere like this, isn’t it?”
“Mhm.”
“You’ll probably be even more amused once we get to the arena. The arena’s where they actually hold all the matches. That said, it probably reeks of blood, so try not to let yourself get too amused, alright?”I knew that bringing a child to a place where violence was enacted on a regular basis wasn’t the best of ideas. It was sure to be a poor influence going forward. That said, Enne wasn’t an ordinary child. She was quite literally a weapon. Enacting violence had, at one point, been her sole purpose. I was confident that she wouldn’t end up growing addicted to bloodshed given the fact that she knew to fear it. The time that she had spent as a magic blade had tempered her to know the insane nature of brutality. There was a chance that experiencing the tournament would be good for her; it would let her see the act of combat in a new light.“Don’t worry, Master,” said Enne. “I’ll only use my power when I’m with you.”
“Thanks for that, by the way,” I said. “You’re a huge help.”Only after wandering around for a bit did I finally find a room with a vacancy. I opened the door and stepped inside, only to find that the whole room’s eyes were on me. Some were giving me glares sharp enough to kill. Others looked on in an expression of amusement. A third group, a group of edgelords, was pretending not to care for what everyone else was doing. They were observing me out of the corners of their eyes while trying their best to blend into the background. Wow. This is nice. The atmosphere this place has got going? Yeah, I like it. You know how the room feels the moment before you step out onto the field in order to participate in some sorta sport? Yeah, it’s kinda like that. There’s this vague sense of excitement buzzing all around the place. Oh, man. This is just how festivals like this have gotta be. This is fucking great.A big smile unfurled under my mask as I slowly looked around the room in a provocative manner whilst moving forward and finding myself an empty seat.<– Prev — Next –>

The Preliminaries Begin
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome, to the one hundredth and seventy-sixth Martial Arts Tournament, the one hundredth and seventy-sixth Destia Trome! Today finally marks the day where our festivities will once again begin!”The master of ceremonies appeared to be using some sort of magic in order to amplify the volume of his voice. It echoed throughout the massive stadium even though he wasn’t shouting at the top of his lungs. The crowd seemed used to it, however, as his voice functioned as a cue that led it to cheer.Unlike the spectators, who were situated in seats located all around the stadium, I was leaning on a guardrail with Zaien slung over my shoulders. But like them, I too was focused on the act of observation. Specifically, I was panning my gaze around the arena and taking in the sights. The excellent view I had was enabled by my current position. I was located on a viewing platform connected to my waiting room. It was placed in close proximity to the arena that would soon serve as the stage in which the tournament’s participants would vie for superiority. And as such, I could easily see every seat on the opposite side of the tournament so long as I chose to direct my gaze upwards. Many had already been filled. It was just the preliminaries, but a large number of people had eagerly come to observe the battles that would soon unfold nonetheless.“A pair of special guests will be joining us this afternoon,” continued the MC. “Both our very own King Phynar and Gojim, Chief of the Fiends, will soon be joining us!”Hearing the announcement led me to cock an eyebrow. I was more surprised than not to hear that the king would be participating in the event, as I had assumed that he would have taken the opportunity in order to work behind the scenes. I guess that means he’s probably done everything he needs to personally attend to. I mean, it’s not like he’s gotta personally take command of every little thing, right?Another equally surprising fact was that I would finally get to see the enemy faction’s leader in person; I hadn’t expected him to show up either.The way he had been addressed was indicative of the sheer extent of his authority. The master of ceremonies thought of him as someone so important that he had mentioned him alongside the king, the person that supposedly lorded over the demon realm. I wonder what he’s like.My original understanding of the fiend faction was warped. I had thought that the term fiend denoted a specific race or group of races, but I was wrong. I would have been more correct a few hundred years ago, as the term used to refer to ancient demons that spawned through spontaneous generation. They were the individuals that Lefi often referred to when she spoke of the demons she had met in her past. As such, I had assumed that modern fiends were their descendants, that they were demons that happened to be more powerful than others as a result of their lineage.But alas, again, I was wrong. It was true that many modern fiends had descended from ancient fiends, and that they judged others based purely off of their bloodlines and pedigree, but it was more than just that. The individuals that labelled themselves fiends were more Jehovah’s Witnesses than they were anything else. The product that they sold was akin to a religion, one that worshipped the concept of power.While they did believe that blood was important, they weren’t completely unwilling to change their own definitions of what was and wasn’t good blood. Fiends had the tendency to label all those willing to support them as pure-blooded fiends and denote their enemies as mudblooded weaklings. These definitions and the cult’s willingness to adjust them was what had made the faction and its adherents so widespread.Most ancient fiends apparently had their races end in demon, so I had assumed that all individuals with races that followed the aforementioned pattern were a part of the modern faction. But again, I was wrong. That said, it was, in fact, more likely than not for any individual with demon in their race to be a part of the faction than not. You know, if this whole thing’s just one big cult, then I’m pretty sure the guy in charge is probably the type of dude that radiates charisma.My thoughts were poised to continue wandering all over the place, but they were interrupted before they could get much further. The door connecting the deck to the waiting room swung open to reveal a member of the event’s staff, one holding something that seemed to resemble a ledger.The staff member took a few moments to explain the day’s agenda. Being outside, we were naturally exposed to the audience’s ridiculously loud cheers. But as I could hear him clearly nonetheless, I didn’t bother leaving the guardrail. To summarize, we were going to be called chronologically by number. One through fifty made up the first group, fifty-one through a hundred made up the second, and so on and so forth. The first round was set to start at ten in the morning, and each was prone to taking anywhere between one and two hours.“Looks like we’re going to have to wait a bit,” I said.
“We’re third?” asked Enne, telepathically.
“Seems like it. We’re probably going to have to fight somewhere around lunchtime,” I said. “We might be able to start around noon if the first two rounds are fast.”Blech. Talk about bad timing.“We’re going to have to fight hungry,” said Enne.
“Probably, yeah,” I said with a light chuckle. “Why don’t we grab something good to make up for it later.”
“Okay,” said Enne. “I can’t wait.”Though I hadn’t realized it at the time, the people around us were giving us a series of stares. They were weirded out by the fact that I was talking to my sword, but I continued to do exactly that regardless.“The first preliminary round will now begin!”The MC’s declaration raised the curtain on the martial arts tournament and led the audience to explode into a series of wild cheers.***Watching the preliminaries hadn’t proven all that entertaining. The real tournament wasn’t set to start until tomorrow, so we were stuck with nothing but a series of messy battle royales. Anyone that had ever won a round in anything beyond the preliminaries was seeded, which in turn meant that the fights we watched contained nothing but a bunch of weaklings. The whole fifty man free for all aspect made the endeavour a lot more interesting from a visual standpoint, but it didn’t change the fact that each individual was still incredibly weak. To make matters even worse, the entire thing was more or less just a massive slugfest, a contest of brute strength where people charged at each other and kept punching until one of the two parties collapsed. There were a few guys that seemed somewhat impressive, but not because they were particularly strong or skilled. They just happened to stand out because they happened to have a thing for acrobatics.The average fighter was basically nothing next to the adventurer I had fought back when it was prince season. Man, thinking back, he really was pretty damn strong, huh? Though I guess there’s not really much of a point comparing him to these fools, seeing as how this is still just the prelims and whatnot. You’d probably have to wait until tomorrow if you wanted to see anything interesting.“The third preliminary match will be starting shortly. All participants, please head over to the stage immediately.”Like everyone else set to participate in round three, I adhered to the announcement and made my way out towards the massive stage in which the fights took place. A single step was all I needed to exit the hallway and step into the arena, but the difference between the two zones was stark. Taking the step felt like putting a foot into a whole other world. The first thing I felt upon exposing myself to the outside was a rush of excitement. And not just my own. The crowd was raring for the fight to begin, and their energy was focused entirely on the stage. Likewise, the other fighters were so tense and worked up that one could almost feel their spirits burn just by being in their proximity.Looking up, I noticed that a large crystal orb was suspended in the air above me. It was about the size of the massive screen one would find in a baseball stadium, and like said screen, its function was to provide a magnified view of the stage with a focus on actions of interest. Man, this world sure is weird. Most of their tech is like stuff out of the dark ages, but then they’ve got shit like this. What the actual fuck?“It looks like all of the third preliminary round’s participants have gathered. So without further ado, let the fight begin!”A low resonant note rang throughout the stadium as one of the event’s staff members struck a large gong.The sound caused the amount of excitement in the air to suddenly spike. And with it rose the temperature. Everyone leapt into action and immediately engaged in a sweaty, all-out brawl.People shouted war cries as their weapons met.Of course, I too was the subject of some degree of aggression. A pair of assailants drew their weapons and charged at me with the spirits blazing despite the fact that I was more or less standing still and not really doing much of anything at all.“Drop dead, brat!” roared one.
“I’m going to murder you!” screamed another.Welp, time to do the thing. We’ve yet to have lunch, so I’mma just wrap this up real quick and then go meet back up with Leila.“Hey Enne?”
“Mmnn?”
“Cover your ears real quick, will ya?”
“Mmk.”Wait. I know I literally just told her to do it, but does Enne even have ears when she’s just a sword? How the hell does she even hear in that form anyway? Man, you know, this is coming pretty late, but Enne sure is one mysterious creature, isn’t she? I smiled wryly as I entertained a few thoughts before taking a deep breath.And then, upon turning towards the two out for my head, I released all the air I had taken in at once.With a roar.The ground shook.The air shook.Everything shook as my primal cry rang loud as thunder.One by one, the other fighters began dropping like flies. Those closest to me were first to fall, but the others further away soon followed suit. The more distance between us there was, the longer it took the individual to fall. But fall they did.A few seconds was all it took for me to end up as the last man standing.All that followed was a moment of silence. None of the other fighters could so much as make a noise. The same went for the crowd. It had stopped responding in its entirety. Well then. And here I was thinking that there’d be at least a few left standing. Oh well, whatever. Works for me.The skill I had activated was none other than the one I had obtained after murdering the brain-damaged dragon supposedly crowned his species’ king. Its effect was to intimidate all foes in range, and in doing so, dull their movements. In other words, it provided crowd control in the form of a slow. However, as demonstrated, it was also capable of knocking out my foes if they were too much weaker than me.“I-I can’t believe it! The match is already over! One of our contestants has defeated all forty-nine of his peers with nothing but a roar!”The MC’s voices served to snap the crowd out of the trance that the sudden change in the situation had left them in. Its members once again began to cheer just as vigorously as they had the moment the match began. Well, demon king, there you are. You wanted me to stand out, so I stood out. But don’t you think that this is all I have in store. Heh. Now listen up, plebs, ‘cause demon lords have got way more juice in them than just a roar or two.And so, I won my preliminary match without so much as drawing Enne from her sheath.***Two men stood side by side in one of the walkways between the seating zones meant for the event’s spectators. The preliminaries had already begun, and as such, they were the only two still in the area. Each was observing the stage with a pair of sharp gazes, gazes completely devoid of all the excitement that possessed the rest of the crowd.“Who’s the guy in the mask?” asked one.
“Phynar snuck him into the competition a few days ago,” replied the other. He claims to have been born in Regighihegg, but that’s most likely false.”
“You think he might be the mercenary that everyone’s been talking about?”
“That certainly does seem to be the case,” spat the second man in a spiteful tone. “And that means that he is only here to sully our honour. Despicable.”The term honour may not have been one that seemed all that important at first glance. But as a matter of fact, it was. As men that believed in a doctrine supporting power over all else, the two discussing the masked man’s identity felt that honour was something to be valued and preserved. The loss of one’s honour was akin to the loss of one’s power. And that, in turn, was no different from the loss of one’s rightful place in the world.“He certainly does seem strong. Do you have any clue who he really is?”
“That’s something we’re still investigating. We’ve yet to figure out the details.”
“He looks like the type to be beyond the reaches of our control. But it doesn’t matter. If he’s going to get in our way, then we’ll crush him the way we would any other obstacle,” said the observer. “Erase him. Erase him before his first real match.”
“Your orders are my will.”
“What a barbaric conversation you two are having.”A third voice suddenly joined in on the conversation.“What!?” Its presence caused both fiends to spin around in surprise.And as they did, they were greeted by the sight of a hood. One of the two immediately reached into his pocket, drew a knife, and launched an attack, but it never reached its target. His arm fell right from his shoulder before it did. Blood immediately began to erupt from the cleanly cut stump.Neither of the two knew exactly when he had drawn it, but the hooded figure had in his hands a naked, bloody blade.“Graaaaaaaagh!?” The man that lost his arm began to scream after a brief delay. It was a loud shout that normally would have attracted plenty of attention. But the crowd drowned it out. Their cheers were so loud that none could hear the expression of his anguish.Upon seeing his comrade fall, the second man immediately turned around and began to run.“No, no, no, get back here. I can’t have you doing that. I’d really rather not be yelled at for letting you get away.”The moment the man took his first step was the moment his head flew from his shoulders. There was a shower of blood, and then, nothing. He collapsed before he even had the chance to scream. That wasn’t to say that there weren’t any screams, however.His companion began to squeal like a terrified piglet.“Oh, don’t you worry. I won’t be killing you. The two of us? We have plenty to talk about,” the hooded figure laughed in a dark tone as he grabbed the armless fiend by the scruff. “I really do appreciate My King’s newest ally. He’s making my job much, much easier.”The moment he finished speaking was the moment the hooded figure suddenly disappeared. And it wasn’t just him. The corpse, the blood, and the armless man were gone too. All of it had, in an instant, vanished without a trace.<– Prev — Next –>

Lunch
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“That was absurd.” The first thing the hooded agent voiced was a complaint. “Do you not understand what it means to have restraint?”
“Your boss literally told me to show off and stand out, so I did.” I responded to her reproachful glare with a shrug.
“…I suppose I cannot deny that. You certainly did draw as much attention as you possibly could have. I don’t think anyone else could have possibly done better,” she sighed. “You did so well that I couldn’t help but complain because it felt as if you were on the verge of overdoing it. Our enemy’s intelligence operatives are sure to leap into action and provide My King with the opportunity he was seeking.”
“Which means I did good, right?”
“That is correct.” Haloria heaved another sigh. “I’m sure that My King is currently in the middle of happily providing us with additional orders despite the fact that we’re far too understaffed to handle even our regular duties. My colleagues are more than willing to give their all for him. They would even die for him, so they are sure to happily accept it all without a word of complaint. In fact, they would probably find themselves elated by the fact that they’re being assigned additional duties. Of course, I feel the same way, but work is still work. Having so much of it remains a cause for concern…”
“I… uh…” I fumbled over my words for a bit as I looked for the right ones. “My bad.”In the end, I gave up and went with a simple apology. Agent McHoodface seemed to be a few years my junior. Hearing a girl that was younger than me complain about being overworked made me cringe. I couldn’t help but pity her. Yeahhh… I should probably send her a care package or two. I’m feeling pretty bad for her right about now.“There’s no need for you to apologize,” grumbled the secret agent. “You did nothing wrong. You’ve done an excellent job carrying out your role as our newest ally. Sorry, and don’t mind my grumbling. I was just exercising my right to complain.”
“Well uh, it sounds pretty rough. Feel free to hit me up if you need someone to talk to. I’m sure me and Leila would both be more than willing to sit down and help talk you through things.”
“It is as My Lord says, Haloria. You’re free to come to me if you ever need any sort of advice.”
“Thank you… Thank you so much, Ma’am.”Haloria almost seemed to sniffle as she thanked my maid. She was evidently deeply moved by her offer. Wait. Did she just say ma’am? The fuck happened while I was away? Actually, you know what? I don’t really need to know, so I’mma just not even ask. It looks like they’ve got a pretty nice dynamic going on, and that it’s working for them. As far as I’m concerned, that’s all that really matters. Whatever bonding they did while I was sitting around and fighting can stay between them.I forced a smile as I shrugged off my theories and turned back towards the super-sized steak I had laid out before me. The hunk of meat was irresistible—it was lightly dripping with fat and all the other juicy good stuff you’d normally expect from a steak. I jabbed a fork into a piece of it and took a bite. Likewise, Enne, who was sitting right by my side, was stuffing her cheeks as quickly as she could. Ermagawd! She’s so cute!We were currently situated in a special area meant exclusively for VIPs. The seats were, for the most part, reserved for nobles and other similarly important people. First-class seats were, of course, accompanied by first-class service. All we had to do if we wanted anything was ask one of the maids stationed nearby, and they’d go fetch it for us. That was exactly how we had gotten our hands on the delicious steaks set out in front of us. We asked the maids for food, and they relayed our desires to the chefs stationed out back.The people running the tournament had literally gone out of their way to hire a bunch of professionals from local restaurants just to ensure that the VIPs had the best experience possible. And as a VIP, I was quite grateful for it. I felt like I was being treated like a king. That said, the service I was getting was by far inferior to the service that the king was getting. Unlike me, he was getting treated like a Super VIP. The area he had booked was even more glamorous and extravagant. Of course, I was barred from visiting it without my disguise. Doing so would be no different from exposing the fact that I was Ypsilon. The king had stated that he wanted to show us a reasonable amount of hospitality. He would have happily welcomed us to his area had we not been concerned about keeping our secrets secret. As such, we settled for the VIP box.“The man in the mask seemed rather powerful. Would you happen to know anything of his identity?” One of the nobles nearby asked a question that concerned me, so I perked up my ears and listened in.
“I was told that he was a mercenary in the king’s employ,” responded his friend.
“A mercenary, you say? Do you suppose he might consider working for me then?”
“I suppose he would, but I believe the king has him paid off for quite some time, so it would have to wait.”I turned to the friendly neighbourhood CIA agent and began speaking in a whisper. “Looks like everything’s going smoothly on your end.”
“Of course it is. My King never fails once his plans are set into motion. He is more than capable of walking his enemies into his traps and wiping them out before they even realize that they have been caught. I can assure you that we have yet to demonstrate the full extent of our strength. The rate at which the pieces fall into place will only continue to rise.”Yeah, sounds good to me. Oh wait, speaking of the king…“You sure it’s fine for the king to be here? It seems like he’s got a lot of stuff on his plate already.”
“Unfortunately, the chief of the fiends is sure to take this as an opportunity to appear in public. My King has little choice but to do the same.”Ahhh… So that’s how it is. I get it. He’s gotta show up to keep the other guy in check so he doesn’t use it as a chance to spread half-truths behind his back and make him look bad. As I understood it, politics was a game in which competitors spent a good amount of time trying their utmost to smear any dirt they had on their rivals all over their faces. And as such, showing up to a public event this large was more or less mandatory if one wished to avoid defamation in the form of biased propaganda.Phynar had to show up to keep his political rival in check. The demon realm was already on the verge of conflict. There was a chance that the chief of the fiends would say just the right words to light the fuse if the king chose to stay holed up in his castle. And that was the one thing the demon king couldn’t afford. Unlike his opponent, he wished to put an end to the situation before it came to an all-out war.“I am sorry to disturb you in the middle of our lunch break, but ladies and gentlemen, the special guests you’ve all been waiting for have finally arrived!” My thoughts were cut short as the master of ceremonies began to speak. “Please, put your hands together and give a warm welcome to King Phynar and Lord Gojim!”The floating crystalline sphere that served as the stadium’s screen suddenly changed perspectives right as the crowd began to clap. It was now focused on the king with his usual smile. I glanced over at the part of the stadium reserved for super VIPs only to see that he was in fact present. When the hell did he get all the way over there? I could’ve sworn that he wasn’t just a few moments ago.His appearance prompted a pair of distinct reactions. The women began making fangirl noises. They screamed and squealed excitedly as soon as they saw him. The men, on the other hand, jeered at the top of their lungs. Their reactions immediately provided me with a much better understanding of exactly how his subjects saw him. So that’s how it is…“Heya everyone! It’s me, Phynar, your king! Today finally marks the start of the festival that we’ve all been waiting for, so let’s all play nice and have plenty of fun.” The blonde demon spoke in a seemingly innocent, boyish, happy-go-lucky tone. He paused for a moment halfway through his speech to look in my direction. “I called one of my friends and had him step in to help make the event a bit more exciting for everyone. He’s really strong, so I’m sure you’ll all just love seeing him in action! That’s it from me. Have fun!”Thanks for the sales pitch, I guess.“Thank you very much, King Phynar. Ladies and gentlemen in the crowd, the individual that our king spoke of today was the mysterious masked fighter who has yet to draw his sword, the man who ended his match with nothing but a roar. Like many of you, I’m itching to see just how powerful he really is, and just how far he’ll go. Once again, that was your king speaking. Please give him another round of applause!”Again, the audience did as instructed and put their hands together for the king.“Next, we have another short speech from our second special guest.”The display switched from the king to another man, one with a short, red butch cut, eyes as sharp as those of a hawk, and a grin as big as that of a snake. He was so beefed up that I could easily make out his muscles even from under his relatively thick clothes. The combination of his ridiculously well-built body and his two-meter tall frame almost made him seem like a giant.Like Phynar’s, his appearance was accompanied by a series of cheers. Or more accurately, war cries. The vast majority of the arena’s men welcomed him by raising their arms and shouting at the top of their lungs.They were so loud that they caused the girl stuffing her face beside me to leap out of her seat in shock. Dude, what the fuck? Don’t be scaring my daughter like that, you pieces of shit. Don’t make me come over there and slit your fucking throats.“Thank you.” All of the cheering died down the moment the fiend lord spoke. “Thank you all for the warm welcome. My name is Gojim, and I have only one thing to say. This competition exists for warriors to demonstrate their strength. Enjoy their displays of valor to your heart’s content!”All of the men in the stadium once again began to clap as he raised his arm and concluded his proclamation. The applause was much louder than the one that the king had received. It even seemed to cause the stadium itself to shake.I see. So he’s the guy the fiends call their chief, huh? I’mma just check out his stats real quick.…Or not. I can’t see jack. It felt like my spell was being repelled by some sort of magical shield. I couldn’t tell whether it was some sort of magical item that shut out other magic in general or whether it was something that repelled analyze in particular, but either way, it was powerful enough to prevent the spell from activating altogether. Is it just me, or does he actually seem pretty demon lord-like. Seems about as charismatic as one too. I can’t really tell how strong he is, but whatever the case, the point stands. Appearance wise, he looks more like a demon lord than both me and the demon king. Fuck, thinking about this is giving me an identity crisis. Feelsbadman. Alright, you know what, fuck you, dude who looks more like a demon lord than me. I won’t forget this. One of these days, I’ll prove that I’m way more of a demon lord than you’ll ever be.***“It has been a while, Phynar.” The chief of the fiends sneered to the man standing beside him. “I see you are still playing the part of the fool.”
“That it has, Gojim. And I see that you’re still playing the part of a muscle brained idiot with a stupid looking face,” The king parroted the other man’s sentence structure for the sole sake of mocking him as he spoke with his usual smile. Even those that knew him well would likely have been surprised to see him spitting venom without so much as even the slightest change in his expression.
“Hmph.” Gojim answered his insult with a snort. “The only man in this realm that would dare call me that is you.”
“Aw, you poor, friendless little thing,” said Phynar. “Unlike you, the people around me care enough not to lie when I ask them what they think of me.”
“It is not I who deserves pity, but you, Phynar. Not even your own men respect you,” said Gojim. “It is a mystery that they obey you to begin with. I see not why anyone would take orders from a mere boy.”
“That would be because my men know how to think for themselves. Unlike the idiots flying your banner, they’re not stupid enough to mistake obedience and absolute submission for loyalty.”
“Hah!” Gojim scoffed. “Let us see how long that confidence of yours holds. Do you truly think that a mere mercenary whose lineage is clear as mud will bring you victory? He will fall, Phynar. It is only a matter of time.”
“Wow, Gojim! You’re such a nice guy! But it’s okay, you don’t need to worry. He’s way stronger than all of those precious little pawns you’ve played.”
“Do not mock my brethren, boy!”Though the two men were engaged in a heated argument, neither’s voice was heard over the crowd. Not even the master of ceremonies, who was standing right in front of them, had realized that they were in the midst of a psychological duel. As such, he turned around and cheerfully smiled at both while approaching and making a request.“Could the two of you please follow through with our agreements and shake hands for the crowd?”The question caused an expression of indignance to momentarily flash accross Gojim’s face, but he honoured his agreement and went forward with it regardless. The crystal orb once again focused on the two guests of honour right as they reached to clasp each other’s hands.Their handshake was quite an image to behold. One of the two men wore a bright but ghastly smile, while the other featured a scornful grin.“Good luck, Phynar. I cannot wait to see that unbecoming look that will soon decorate your face.”
“The best to you too, Gojim. I hope that you’ll enjoy your last few days of freedom, because once this tournament’s over, your life will change forever.”There wasn’t any audio feed; the crowd had no way of knowing that the two were talking each other down despite exchanging what appeared to be a handshake symbolizing goodwill.<– Prev — Next –>

The Main Event Begins: Yuki’s First Match
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerI stepped back onto the stage the day after my preliminary match. It was time for my first real match. And I was ready. My mask was on, my hair was dyed, and my trusty sword was slung over my shoulder.“First up, we have the man that single-handedly ended his preliminary match without even drawing his weapon, a mysterious cutthroat sent by the king himself to eliminate everyone in his way! Ladies and gentlemen, I present you a man whose abilities have yet to be unveiled. Please give it up for Ypsilon!”The MC’s intro led the crowd to break into cheers.“And up against him is a giant of a man who uses his large frame to deliver all sorts of different attacks, one that always surprises us with a series of new moves. I would like to extend a warm welcome to a man that has participated in Destia Trome a total of ten times! To Paragrowe!”
“Paragrowe! Paragrowe! Paragrowe!”
“Kick his ass, Paragrowe! You got this!”The crowd broke into a much louder set of cheers the moment my opponent stepped in from the opposite side of the area. Wow, okay. Fuck this guy. I’mma totally murk his ass.Paragrowe was just about as big as the master of ceremonies had described. He was a hulking mass of a man dressed from head to toe in nothing but pure muscle. The way he lumbered onto the stage almost made me think that he was some sort of gorilla.“Winning. The. Preliminaries. Like. That. Must. Have. Felt. Good.” He spoke in a deep, throaty voice. Listening to him seemed like more of a pain than not given the fact that his speech was distorted. He had to take a moment to inhale after each word. “But. Don’t. Get. Cocky.”
“…”
“All. You. Did. Was. Crush. A. Bunch. Of. Weaklings. Any. Of. Us. Regulars. Can. Do. That. With. Ease.”
“…”“Hah. You. Scared? How. About. You. Say. Something?”
“Oh, my bad. I wasn’t really paying attention since I can’t speak gorilla. You’re probably going to need to learn to stop snorting each time you say something if you want me to actually understand you.”The gorilla’s veins began to bulge as his face twisted in anger. The look he had on his ugly mug clearly conveyed his thoughts in a manner that his dysfunctional mouth couldn’t. My taunt seemed rather well-timed, as the gong signifying the start of the match rang throughout the arena the moment I pissed him off.Spurred on by the bell, the Gorilla charged right at me. Each of his steps was accompanied by a tremor; he was so swole that the earth shook in response to his actions. He pulled his fist behind him and launched it with all the force of a cannon as he loosed an angry battle cry. The oversized monkey turned out to be exactly what his gear, or rather lack thereof, suggested. He was the type of fighter that preferred the use of his body to any sort of artificial weapon.“I! Will! Shred! You! To! Bits!”The cannonball that was his fist flew straight for my face. But it stopped in its tracks before it could reach me.“What!?”King Kong screamed in surprise as he realized that his full force punch had lost all of its momentum the moment it came into contact with my open palm.“You know, that wasn’t a bad punch,” I said as I began to grin (not that he could see it given my mask.) “Well. My turn.”I smashed Zaien, sheath and all, into the side of his gut. I would have loved to draw the blade I thought of as my daughter, but I couldn’t. He was too weak. Tanking a hit from her was sure to end his life.The tournament was freestyle, so most things were allowed. Killing one’s opponent, however, was not. Doing so was considered foul play and would result in immediate disqualification. In other words, I was probably going to have to keep Enne in her sheath for quite a few fights unless I wanted to get myself booted out of the tourney. I wonder if anyone’ll actually be strong enough to force me to draw her?Fortunately, my sheath strike wasn’t heavy enough to flat out kill my enemy. That wasn’t to say it was weak, however. The tap had not only knocked the wind out of him but also sent him skidding across the arena. He kicked up clouds upon clouds of dust as he slid.And that was only the beginning. I wasn’t about to be done just yet.I dashed past him and moved behind his needlessly large frame before he could so much as fully hit the ground. There was only one thing any reasonable person would do from such a position: smash his fucking head into the ground. And I did exactly that. I placed a foot on the back of his cranium and pushed hard enough to slam his face against the arena’s floor. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure he was out, so I gave him another stomp for good measure.When the dust cleared, it revealed that the match was over. His eyes had rolled back into his sockets; he was out cold.“W-what!? What just happened!? I couldn’t even see what happened! Paragrow was supposed to be the one on offence, but it looks like his attack didn’t connect! The ten-time participant is on the ground, down and out for the count!”The MC immediately described the situation to the audience, which promptly responded with a series of boos. They didn’t seem to like the fact that I was using my foot to grind the gorilla’s face into the dirt. Well, fuck you too!I raised my free hand and gave the crowd the finger, an action that only led to even more booing.“W-what a display of arrogance!” Apparently, the MC wasn’t quite done shoutcasting, as he continued to narrate the events that occurred. “Ypsilon has not only disrespectfully stepped all over his opponent’s face, but also agitated the crowd!”Wew. This is fun. You know how wrestling has heels? Fighters that like playing the part of the big bad evil guy? Yeah, I think I’m starting to get why they act the way they do. Like, holy shit. Doing whatever the fuck I want is so fun I think I might already be hooked. Woo! Plus one to being a fucking villain, and plus one to doing whatever the fuck I want!On a related note, I know I’ve said this already, but I would have made a terrible hero. Thank god I didn’t end up stuck as one of those, right?With my first round won, I casually began waltzing off the stage. The crowd was still booing me, but I didn’t care. If anything, their jeers only made me feel all the better.***The first thing I did after getting back to the waiting room assigned to me was to reach into my inventory and grab the bell that the demon king had given me. Unlike the room I had sat around in before my preliminary match, the room I was currently in was private. I was the only person in it, so I was safe to more or less do whatever.“Welp. Time to summon me a CIA agent, I guess.”I gave the strange, silent apparatus a quick shake. A series of magical waves emerged from within it and spread throughout my surroundings. One of Haloria’s coworkers responded to my summons immediately. One of the room’s corners rapidly distorted. Everything within a predefined space seemed to contort before coming together to form a single hooded man.“Huh, never seen that before,” I said. “Was that spatial manipulation?”
“Wow, colour me impressed,” said the hooded man with a wry smile. “I didn’t think you would be able to see through me that easily. You even seemed to know exactly where I’d appear despite never having seen the spell before.”
“Ehhhh, yeah, I’m pretty good with that kinda stuff. It’s no big deal.” I shrugged.Magic Eye allowed me to perceive anything that happened to involve mana. Seeing through a teleport or two was a piece of cake. You know, now that I think about it, that skill sure is batshit broken, isn’t it? It’s probably the most OP thing I’ve got. Man, I should preach this shit. In fact, I might as well start going door to door and asking people if they’ve got time to talk about Magic Eye, my lord and saviour.Speaking of looking at things, I decided to analyze the secret agent as he appeared. His stats were as follows:***

***The assassin that had appeared before me was incredibly strong. Monsters and dragons aside, he was undoubtedly the strongest individual I had ever analyzed. A part of his strength stemmed from his particular skillset. How the hell are you supposed to stop someone capable of manipulating spacetime? Shit dude, I can’t even begin to imagine how you’re supposed to deal with that kinda bullshit. Sound magic seems pretty useful too. I can swear I didn’t hear jack shit when he first showed up. Dude was totally dead silent. Looks like the demon king’s got some pretty competent men working under him, huh?“So? Did you need me for something?”
“Yeah. Iunno if you know already, you probably do, but I just wanted to tell you that it seems the enemy’s got a few guys in the crowd. They were obviously trying to find a chance to attack me. I’d like you guys to do me a favour and take ‘em out whenever you get the chance.”As far as I could tell, the individuals in question either were fiends or were working for them. They were standing by with spells at the ready. My ability to see mana had clearly informed me that they were looking for a chance to strike, but the battle had ended before such an opportunity had reared its head.“You were able to notice them despite being in the midst of a fight? Impressive. I should have expected nothing less of the man the king deemed a necessary ally,” said the agent. “Would you happen to recall their positions?”
“Uhhh… let’s see…” I looked outside the waiting area and turned my gaze on the audience. “You can actually see them from here. You see how there’s a guy with a buzzcut sitting in the third row from the top in the section right across from us? He was the first guy. The second guy’s to the first guy’s right. He’s in the next area over. He’s the guy with the glasses in the front row, and he’s seated right next to the couple with the kid.”I pointed out the first two I recalled before putting a hand on my chin.“I feel like there were a few more, but I can’t remember where they were off the top of my head. Sorry.”
“No need for any apologies. You’ve already provided us with more than enough information. I’ve already been informed of where all the others are located. We’ll have them taken care of shortly,” said the assassin. “And thank you once again for your cooperation. You’ve been very helpful.”
“Don’t worry about it. Getting rid of them helps me as much as it helps you. Anyway, good luck.”I dismissed the man with a wave of my hand. He bowed to express his gratitude before using the power of spatial manipulation to vanish into thin air.<– Prev — Next –>

The Main Event Begins: The Old Butler — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“And the winner of this round is once again the man that almost appears to be an unstoppable force, Ypsilon!”A mix of cheers and jeers erupted from the crowd the moment the MC announced the fight’s results. Heh. Looks like Operation Stand The Fuck Out is moving along pretty smoothly.Discounting the preliminaries, I had already fought in a total of three matches, and I had played the part of the heel in each. In wrestling, heels had the tendency to scream at their opponents, call them weaklings, and proclaim that they would never be defeated by the likes of whoever it was they were up against. I, however, had not. I had instead drawn the audience’s ire through the actions I took in battle. Strangely enough, a good chunk of the crowd had taken a liking to me regardless. Talk about having weird tastes.My supporters weren’t the only ones growing in number. Those that wished to interfere with my matches were too. More and more red dots appeared on my map after each of my fights, but they never got the chance to actually do any harm. The hooded agents that served as my allies were doing their jobs well; they would always erase my would-be assailants before they could do any harm. The reason that the enemy count was increasing regardless was because the person in charge of deploying them was sending an even larger wave each time the last was destroyed. Man, having good allies sure makes life easy. They’re handling this way better than I ever could have. And yeah, I know what you’re thinking. You want to smack me and say, “What the fuck, dude? Weren’t you just bitching about how your allies were going to be weak and useless a few days ago?” I can’t lie. You’re totally right. I was being stupid and looking down on people I hadn’t even met yet. I was jumping to conclusions when I really shouldn’t have been. I probably owe them an apology.“So what do you think, Enne? Of this whole tourney thing, I mean.” I turned to the girl sitting beside me as I spoke. The two of us were currently located on top of a bench inside of my personal waiting room. Naturally, we had made sure to check that no one else was around before she changed forms.
“It’s…” She paused for a moment to think. “Really loud.”
“Yeah, it totally is,” I laughed.
“And I hate that people are booing you.” She looked towards the audience as her face warped in disappointment.Seeing her like that led me to start scratching one of my cheeks with a troubled smile; it took me a good few moments to formulate an explanation.“Well, if it makes you feel any better, they’re not actually doing it because they hate me. I’m doing mean stuff on purpose, and they’re just playing along,” I said.As Enne didn’t know much about wrestling or any other combat-based sport, she lacked the knowledge required for her to understand that booing wasn’t necessarily representative of genuine hate. I didn’t expect her to immediately come to understand that heels and booing went hand in hand. The audience was an important part of the performance. A strong negative reaction was needed to contribute in order to perfect the beauty that came with the art of acting like a badass villain. I mean, at least that’s how I think it works. I’m pretty sure they don’t actually hate me, right? Right…?“Really…?”
“Y-Yeah, I think so,” I stuttered. “You know how you girls play pretend? It’s basically the same thing.”They would pretend to be demon lords, while I would pretend to be a hero. And then they would proceed to defeat me.“Then you can’t do it anymore,” she pouted. “You have to make everyone see how cool you are. Like a real demon lord would.”
“Uhh… I’m pretty sure playing the bad guy is way more demon lord-like than just being cool.”
“Still. You can’t. No more playing the bad guy.”Enne turned her gaze upwards and looked right at me as she made the demand.“Alright, alright, fine. I get it.” I flashed a strained smile as I patted her on the head. “I’ll act more like a demon lord and make everyone think I’m cool. Okay?”
“Okay,” she said with a satisfied nod.Our conversation seemed to have ended at just the right time, as Enne’s expression of content was immediately followed by a knock. I had the blade girl return to her real body before opening the door. Standing in the doorway was one of the event’s staff members, a demon girl with horns and a tail.“It’s almost time for your next match, sir,” she said. “Please make your way to the arena’s entrance once you’re ready to go.”It was just the usual announcement, so I did the same thing I’d done the past few times and used my hand to signal that I had received the message. All of the other staff members understood that it was my way of dismissing them. They would immediately leave in order to attend to the rest of their duties. This one, however, did not. She remained in the doorway and fidgeted about for a bit before finally plucking up enough courage to see her intentions through.“Y-Your matches are some of the most exciting I’ve ever seen, Mr. Ypsilon!” she spoke in a bit of a rushed tone, fumbling over her words as she presented me with whatever it was she had been holding behind her back the whole time. “C-Could I please have your autograph?”There was an item in each of the girl’s hands. In her left was a freshly-inked feather pen, and in her right was a piece of parchment that looked more durable than usual. I guess that must be what they use in place of autograph sheets.Oh, I see now. It wasn’t that she didn’t get the hand signal or anything. She was just hanging around ‘cause she wanted an autograph. Wait… She wants an autograph…?I hadn’t thought my actions through until after accepting everything she wanted to hand me, so I ended up freezing up the moment I finally processed the fact that she was asking for my signature. Crap. What do? How am I supposed to sign something for her if I don’t actually have a god damned signature? …Alright, fuck it. I’mma just write Ypsilon in katakana and call it a day. She probably won’t know the difference anyway.With that decided, I pressed the parchment against the wall, “signed” it, and returned it to its owner.“Thank you so much!” she squealed excitedly before running right off.
“What a weirdo…” said Enne, telepathically.
“I know, right?”So uh… I should probably practise my signature, huh? You know, just in case I ever get asked for another autograph.***There wasn’t much for me to do in terms of getting ready, so I headed over to the stage right after the demon girl left. Upon entering it, I found myself greeted by even more noise than usual. The audience was hyped, with a capital everything.“And against him is a man not to be underestimated, a man whose appearance belies the extent of his strength! His blade is so charming and graceful that it can be likened to a vicious, deadly dance! Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a man that has one-sidedly destroyed every single opponent he’s faced despite never having participated in Destia Trome! Please give a warm welcome to Remiero!”The man that entered from the opposite side of the arena could only be described as an old butler. The expression on his face matched his age; he was wearing the kind of gentle smile you would expect to see on an old, refined gentleman’s face. That, however, was the only part of him that looked his age. Despite having lived long enough to justify retirement, his back was straight as a rod and his steps were firm. The composed, dauntless way he carried himself made him seem much younger than he really was. Wait. He’s human.“Are you… one of Nell’s buddies?”
“I suppose you must be the ally that she was speaking of?” said the old man with a dandy smile.
“You could tell?”
“We were given a quick overview of your traits and features,” he said. “The biggest giveaway was your sword. We were told that it was curved, of an absurd length, and had a black and red ribbon on its handle. It gave you away on sight.”Ohhh, I see. So he used Enne to ID me. It was a reasonable approach. I had basically never put Enne away ever since she had become more sentient. That said, it wasn’t as if I paraded her around either. I made sure to keep both her and her sheath wrapped up in a large cloth save for when I was in the arena. Wow. Nell’s got a pretty good memory. Could’ve sworn I only took her out of the cloth for a few seconds when we were back at the bar. I’m surprised that was enough for her to remember so many details.“Now let’s get this match underway!” said the MC. “Ready? Fight!”The gong rang throughout the stadium, but neither of us sprung into action immediately.“Well, I would have loved to continue to chat, but it appears that it’s time for us to begin. Wouldn’t want to keep the crowd waiting, after all,” he said with a smile. “Why don’t we save the small talk for later? I would hate to waste the opportunity to face you in battle. I’m sure it would make for an excellent round of practice.”His aura changed as he drew the rustic blade hanging from his waist. The old butler’s aura suddenly swelled in size; he began giving off an overwhelming sense of pressure and intimidation.“Practice, my ass! Dude, I can totally tell that you’re trying to murder me!”
“Not at all, good sir, not at all,” denied the butler. “Please do forgive me, the hero’s description of you happened to spark my curiosity. I can’t help but wonder the extent of your strength.”
“Oh okay. So when all’s said and done, all you really wanted to do was test me, huh?”
“I suppose you could say that,” he said with a ferocious smile.It was clear as day that the opponent I was faced with was no ordinary Joe, so I analyzed him in order to get a better idea of what I would be up against.***

***Dude! What the fuck!? What the actual fuck!? Dude’s the type of guy you’re not supposed to run into until the tournament’s starting to come to an end! Look at how OP he is! Holy shit! Oh man, this is bad. The assassin I met yesterday has got better stats, but this dude’s definitely way better with a sword. He’s got sword mastery at level fucking ten! That shit’s capped, bro! It literally doesn’t get any higher! Hell, every single one of his skills is at least at level seven. Look at his class too! He’s a sword saint! A fucking sword saint! He’s even got a friggin’ matching title. And don’t even get me started on that dex stat! What the fuck!My newest opponent was so confident in his overwhelming power that he didn’t even bother hiding the fact that he was human. It didn’t take a genius to guess his reasoning. He was strong enough to deal with just about anything, even should a situation ever go sour. And he would probably be respected for it too. As far as the demon realm was concerned, might meant right. Oh, I get it. He’s probably not hiding his humanity because standing out will help everyone he’s working with blend in better with the crowd. Yeah, sounds about right. He seems more than capable of handling any danger that comes his way as a result.Man, I really need to stop meeting OP people. They’re really throwing off my sense of how strong the average person is supposed to be and it’s messing with my head. Though, I guess that is just kinda what demon realms do. They mess with you and throw you off. Not that the old man’s affiliated with the demon realm. Whatever, you get the point.One of the first decisions I came to after seeing his stat page was to avoid pure swordplay. I was almost positive that he would best me ten times out of ten if I relied on my terrible sword arm. My stats were way higher than his, but that wasn’t to say that he couldn’t beat me. Lopping off my head or stabbing me through the heart were both easy ways for him to ensure my death. Errr, wait a second. I think I might be jumping to a few too many conclusions there. Honestly, I wouldn’t be all that surprised if I managed to survive what would otherwise have been a fatal injury, but I’m not about to go test it. I can’t really imagine anything good coming from testing something like that.While the tourney didn’t endorse fatalities, I had to consider the possibility that it could happen given the butler’s might; I was sure to lose if I didn’t take him seriously. Welp. Time to try my best. Enne did just tell me to show off and make everyone think I’m cool and whatnot, after all.“It doesn’t look like you’re the type of opponent I can go easy on.” I drew my sword, put its sheath in my inventory, and muttered a line under my breath. “Let’s do this, Enne.”
“Let’s,” she replied telepathically.Her crimson blade glittered as it reflected the sun’s rays.“Would you look at that! Ypsilon has finally drawn his weapon! What do you think, ladies and gentlemen? Does this mean Remiero really is just as strong as we’ve all thought!?”The MC began to do his usual commentary, but I didn’t pay it mind. I purged both it and the crowd’s cheers from my mind in order to focus my mind on the foe standing before me.After calming myself down, I let out a short exhale before kicking off the ground with all the force of an explosion and diving right at my opponent.“Come at me, old-timer!”<– Prev — Next –>

The Main Event Begins: The Old Butler — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerMy attack marked the battle’s true start. I backed a heavy, downwards swing with all the forward momentum of my charge. All the power put into the strike made it incredibly fast, but the butler dodged it with ease. His dodge was so practiced and deliberate that it almost made avoiding the blade look the most natural thing to do. With its target missing, my sword ended up cleaving into the stage instead, causing a conspicuously loud crash in the process.I grunted as I pulled the weapon out of the ground and quickly turned the motion into a sideways swing. Of course, that wasn’t the only thing I did. I kicked up some of the debris that my first attack had knocked all over the place at my opponent as I went in to bolster my chances of success.Much to my displeasure, he managed to not only drain my projectiles of their momentum by splitting them to pieces before they reached him, but also dodge Enne’s blade by stepping out of her range. And he did it all with only the slightest bit of effort. The look on his face was literally as composed as it possibly could have been.“Those are some terrifyingly quick attacks,” said the butler.
“Yeah, totally sounds legit coming from the guy dodging them without even breaking a sweat.”I knew that I had to crank my engines up as far as they would go if I didn’t want to lose, so I conjured up a series of water dragons and had them charge at the old butler. The spell was one that I employed often; I was so used to it that it no longer had any cast time whatsoever.Each of the serpentine fabrications roared as they opened their jaws and coiled around each other in the middle of their suicidal charge. Yeah, I know the roaring doesn’t really make sense, especially since it’s not a part of the spell. I’m not really sure when they started doing it either, but they just kinda did.But my opponent cut them down.“The fuck!? Bro, you’ve gotta be kidding me!”A single slash was all he needed to cleave through the spell. He had raised his sword above his head and split my attack into two neat halves as he brought it back down. The magically constructed fluids immediately lost its form before vanishing as if it had never existed in the first place. Bruh. Hold up. I didn’t even know that cutting magic was possible. What the fuck?“I would advise against lowering your guard.”
“Woah!”My reaction speed was dulled by my surprise, so I didn’t notice that the butler had attacked until he was right in my face. I lowered Enne to guard against his blade as he thrust it at me, but my foe reacted to my attempt at defence and negated it. His blade suddenly changed trajectories and slithered over my own. The fuck!?And that wasn’t all. He continued to demonstrate that it was far removed from the norm. Both his arm and his blade seemed to split into two, with one closing in on me from each side.I stepped back far enough to avoid losing my arms, but I took a good bit of damage regardless. He had cut deep enough into my shoulders to cause a spray of blood to erupt from each.“T-The fuck was that!?”As far as I could tell, he had launched a pair of synchronized attacks fast enough to create after images.“Just a clever little trick,” he said. “I’m sure that you too would be able to perform it with a bit of practice.”Uhh… dude. Not everyone’s a superman like you, y’know? My dexterity stat had risen a lot since my reincarnation. And as a result, I had gotten a lot better at using magic. My ability to wield a sword, however, had improved by only a questionable margin. The change it experienced was so tiny that I wasn’t even sure whether I had really improved or if it was all just a placebo. Unfortunately, I was well aware of the fact that I simply had no talent for swordplay. My only option was to fake it by brute-forcing my way through my opponents with numbers and skill levels. Oh, god damn it. I totally would have leveled up both my sword and greatsword mastery before leaving home if I knew this was going to happen. Their effects stack, so boosting both would probably help me a tonne. Er, actually probably not. At least not against this dude.Alright, Yuki. You can do this. Calm down, use your head. I had known from the start that beating a literal sword saint at swordplay was a fool’s errand. I was much faster than him and his old, creaky frame, but he made better use of his body. Unlike mine, his movements weren’t anywhere near as wasteful. He was both efficient and as hard to read as a leaf fluttering its way to the ground.That said, it wasn’t as if I didn’t have anything over him. Alright, let’s see… I’ve got strength on him. I could totally crush him if it came down to a contest of brute force, physical or magical. He can’t fly either, so there’s always that. Oh yeah, and I’ve got Enne. That’s gotta be a huge plus. Alright, I think I’ve got a pretty solid game plan. Let’s do this!“Enne! Activate wind magic!” I barked an order as I materialized my wings.
“Okay!” she said with a telepathic nod. The sword girl had immediately grasped my intentions.I positioned her behind me and began channelling my magical energy through her to wreath her blade in flames. She followed up the action by beginning to eject the air around her. There was a sudden explosion; I shot forward with all the force of a missile.“You better get ready to stop, drop, and roll if you don’t want to burn to death, old-timer!”I literally flew at him and attempted to maul him with my engine. He knew just as well as I did that taking a hit from a literal flaming blade was a recipe for disaster, so he leapt backwards in order to avoid the attack by a large margin. That, however, wasn’t anywhere near enough to avoid me.My swing had caused the engine to momentarily shift in front of me and provide me with a burst of backwards acceleration. It seemed like he was going to gain on me, but I flapped my wings while reorienting my blade in order to make a U-turn and continue firing myself in his direction. I gave my wings another flap right before I reached him in order to change my trajectory in an attempt to subvert his guard.“How irksome!” The old man groaned as he evaded my blade. Wait. Wait! He’s calling ME irksome! Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
“Says the guy that’s stupidly hard to read!”I yelled back at him out of pure obligation as I flew circles around him and continued my assault. Enne’s flames grazed him over and over. The butler uniform he was wearing took severe damage. The man himself, however, did not. He had avoided taking even a single critical hit. The lack of progress started to tilt me, so my attacks lost their form as time progressed. They grew wilder and less thoughtful, a fact the old-timer took advantage of immediately. He made use of the increase in the number of openings I had to counter with a slash to the flank.Ow… I groaned internally. Fortunately, the cut was a shallow one, but it was an impressive feat nonetheless. Even monsters with stats that matched my own would have to get pretty lucky if they wanted to evade my Ennegine based attacks. What the hell, man? The fuck’s up with this guy’s reflexes? I can’t believe he managed to throw a counter while I was moving around that quickly.Frankly, the butler was terrifying. One’s stats had the tendency to drop as one’s body succumbed to age, which meant that he would have been even stronger in his prime. I had the sneaking suspicion that the man before me had once been strong enough to go toe to toe with dragons.“What an amazing display of skill from both sides!” shouted the caster. “Can you believe that we’re only in round four, ladies and gentlemen!?”His voice was immediately followed by a series of cheers. Again, I groaned internally, and not from pain this time. I was starting to get annoyed by both the MC and the crowd. They were too noisy and it was hard to focus.Upon realizing that I was letting myself get a bit too tilted for comfort, I decided to stop and take a deep breath. Alright Yuki, calm down. You can do this. You just gotta stay calm.I dispelled the flames enveloping Enne’s body and got her to stop casting wind magic before taking a moment to erase everything but my foe from my mind.“Master. How are your wounds?” she asked, telepathically.
“I’m fine. How’s your mana holding up?”
“I have about… ten percent left.”Shit. I let myself get carried away and used up a bit too much for comfort. Man, times like these, I really wish potions actually worked on Enne.“So that sword of yours is an intelligent weapon?” asked the butler. “This is my first time ever seeing one in person.”
“I’m surprised you could tell.”
“I could sense it abiding by your will,” he said. “It is quite the splendid blade. Do treat it well.”
“That’s been the plan from the start,” I said. “She’s pretty much the most adorable little thing ever, so I don’t see any reason I wouldn’t.”The air around my opponent eased for just a moment as his expression reverted to the kind you’d see on any other nice old man. Likewise, Enne also seemed to react by doing the telepathic equivalent of squirming around in embarrassment. See what I mean? She’s so cute!“Would you mind doing me the favour of descending and meeting me on the ground?” asked the butler.
“Oh, hell naw. That sounds dangerous as fuck, and I’m not about that life,” I said. You see, up here, I don’t need to worry about you hitting me, oldtimer.
“Well, then I suppose I will have to resort to something a little less orthodox.”Crisis detection suddenly kicked in and warned me that I was in trouble. And lots of it. I didn’t think I could face the incoming attack head-on, so I flapped my wings as hard as I could in order to force myself to evade. The wind roared. A sword beam came at me and cleaved through the airspace I had been occupying just a moment prior. It missed my face by no more than just a few centimetres. THE FUCK WAS THAT!? I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE! IS THAT WHAT MAXING SWORD MASTERY DOES!? GIVE YOU FUCKING SWORD BEAMS!?Though I was screaming in confusion, I had, in fact, processed his attack. My magic eye allowed me to understand that he had filled his blade with magical energy and released it as he swung it. Shit man, that surprised me as much as a jack in the box would surprise a toddler.“I’m surprised you avoided that.”
“Dude, what the fuck! I thought I was about to die, fuck me, holy shit!”The first thing I did after firing off a series of complaints was pay him back in kind. I did the exact same thing he did: I filled Enne with mana and took extra care not to activate crimson blaze. Instead, I imagined the magical energy flying off into the distance as I released it.And that was exactly what happened. I managed to send a sword beam flying right at the old butler. He avoided the attack, but it managed to prove itself a significant source of power by carving a large gash into the arena’s floor. Wow. That worked a lot better than I thought it would.“You have learned the attack just by seeing it?” asked the butler. “How outstanding. I expected nothing less.”
“Mark my words, old-timer, I’m going to wipe that confident smile off your face!”It’s time for round two! Let’s do this!<– Prev — Next –>

The Main Event Begins: The Old Butler — Part 3
Editors: Joker, SpeedphoenixThe old butler was one hell of a foe. I tried all sorts of attacks, but none were able to truly find their mark. If I were to seek a cause, I would likely label his skills. Namely, Mind’s Eye and Blade Seer. It felt as if he foresaw each and every single one of my attacks; I got read like Dr. Seuss.Unlike the butler, who happened to be a true master of his craft, I was just another undertrained whelp. If I were to go back in time and ask the me from a year ago whether I knew anything about martial arts, or whether I got into fights all the time, the answer would be a simple “no.” My lack of experience put me at a disadvantage despite the difference in our stats.It wasn’t as if I was truly helpless. In fact, seeing Lefi’s magic in action had prompted me to develop a spell focused entirely on mass destruction. All I needed to do to delete the butler was use it. But I couldn’t. It was too powerful. Casting it would lead to the obliteration of the entire stadium. The happy, festive event currently underway would end up being warped into a tragic “accident” to be remembered for generations. That, however, did not by any means imply that magic-based brute force was off the table.If large scale spells were off the table, then all I had to do was throw smaller ones at him until one eventually landed. My goal was simple. I would create a literal bullet hell, a barrage so thick that it would be impossible for him to keep up regardless of whether or not he could see through each and every single attack. Alright, time to go all out!“You better brace yourself, old-timer, ‘cause I’m not about to give you any more chances to rest!”
“I really would not take any offence if you were to take pity on these frail old bones of mine.”
“Frail old bones my ass!”I positioned myself in the air right above him and began channelling my magical energy in order to create dozens upon dozens of water dragons.“Go! Attack the old-timer and take from him the few years he has left!” I shouted an order that even I thought was a bit too malevolent as I showered him with projectiles. The dragons that materialized in my vicinity began darting towards him.My attacks were met with an onslaught of blades. It was almost like they were being repelled by a literal barrier of swords despite him only wielding a single weapon. Everything, everything that closed in on him would be split in two. But I didn’t care.“ORAORAORAORA!” I screamed like a man in the midst of a bizarre adventure as I kept up the assault. Every dragon that was destroyed was replaced immediately; I showed him what it meant to play a real shoot ‘em up.That said, I was fully aware of the fact that a few dozen water dragons wasn’t going to be enough to surmount the butler’s strength. He was cutting through them at inhuman speeds and destroying them with ease. That was fine. Because they were just the setup. I used the fact that he was distracted in order to create a massive earth dragon identical to the one I had used against the bandits.My stone creation roared as it joined the fray. The butler tried cutting through it the same way he had with the water dragons, but unfortunately for him, the earth dragon was of a different make. Even the mana that it was composed of was different. Though I had made it in tandem with my water dragons, I had done so using a separate part of my mana pool. He could still slice it into pieces, but it would simply reconstruct itself and continue attacking him regardless.He immediately realized that interception fire wasn’t going to cut it, so he opted for evasive maneuvers instead. He positioned himself such that it was between him and the water dragons and used it as a shield. Damn, he’s good! But this ain’t over yet.The old-timer jumped and rolled around in order to avoid wave after wave of attacks.Only for the ground underneath him to explode as he took one wrong step. Unlike every other attack I launched at him, the butler hadn’t foreseen the one he was just hit by, so he wasn’t able to dodge it; his body was immediately engulfed in fire and smoke. The attack that he had been hit by was one of the many traps that I had planted while distracting him with my draconic onslaught. My battle with the douchelord had taught me that traps were extremely useful, so I learned to make them with primordial magic. The specific trap that the butler stepped on was fairly simple. It would activate whenever someone stepped on it and use magic to create an explosion. As it was buried underneath the earth, the bits of arena above it would be transformed into shrapnel. Long story short, it was a magical landmine, one that benefited from the effects of trap mastery. The skill made it not only more powerful but also more difficult to detect.So powerful was the mine’s output that it would have blown any ordinary foe’s lower half to bits. The butler, however, was anything but normal. Never once had I assumed that a mere trap would be enough to finish him off. But with that said, it still provided me with the perfect opportunity to win the match. If I was going to end this, I would have to do it here and now.I had every single dragon charge straight into the center of the explosion whilst doing the same myself. I flapped my wings, oriented myself in his direction, and dove. Going all-in was the name of the game. Or at least it would have been had my crisis detection skill not kicked in.Danger was headed my way, and fast. I immediately reacted by swivelling around in the air. A blade flew past me with all the speed of a laser mere moments after I dodged. His clothes were torn and his body was covered in soot. But that didn’t stop him. He had leapt right at me the moment I entered his range and attempted to deliver a high-speed stab. Damn. You scary, man.I fixed my posture in midair immediately after completing my dodge and swung Enne. He managed to parry her and ward her off right before he lost all momentum and started to fall.“You’re not getting away!”Flapping my wings, I accelerated downwards and chased with an overhead swing. He blocked and chained his defensive measure into a slash. He managed to draw blood, but the fact that his stance was broken meant that it wasn’t actually poised to attack. The attack ultimately amounted to nothing more than just a graze, so I ignored it as I smashed my foot into his torso from above. I made sure to follow through with the attack; I kept my foot on him and slammed him into the arena.An incredible sense of impact rang throughout my body. The ground beneath us almost seemed to shake.It was a heavy blow. The butler, who had been unable to defend, coughed out a mouthful of blood. Despite having taken serious damage, he continued to fight regardless. He swung his blade, but it was a much weaker swing than usual, so I kicked it away with the leg I didn’t have on his torso and positioned Enne by his neck.“Looks like I win,” I said with a pant.
“It certainly does,” he chuckled. “It appears that I’ve lost despite intending to do the opposite.”He was hurt so bad that there was blood dribbling from his lips, but he smiled regardless. It was a teasing smile, the kind you would see on a child’s face immediately following an innocent prank.“And we have our winner! Ypsilon has taken yet another match by storm!”The audience, which had been left silent by our display, began to roar with cheers as soon as the MC declared my victory.I exhaled deeply as I took my foot off of him and hoisted my blade back over my shoulder. “You should probably hit up wherever they keep the doctor around here, and fast. You’re getting on in years, old-timer. You really shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard.”“I suppose so,” said my opponent with a bit of a laugh. “I will do as you have suggested and head over to the infirmary immediately.”He got up off the ground and began patting off his clothes. The way he carried himself made it seem as if he was completely uninjured.“I was lucky you were so old.” I smiled in a strained manner as I watched him walk away. Though he had borrowed a shoulder from a member of the medical team, he still seemed to have the same firmness in his steps as usual.I hadn’t killed him, but I had done some major damage. And frankly, seeing him just walk it off as if it was no big deal was terrifying, even if he was just putting on a strong front. It was as I said. I was lucky that he was as old as he was. The degradation of his body was the reason I had taken so little damage; I probably would have lost had he still been in his prime.As I hadn’t watched every single fight, I didn’t know exactly how skilled the tournament’s participants really were. However, my duel against the old butler had at least proven that it wasn’t all just fun and games. Some of the event’s participants were at the peak of their game, the top of their class. And that wasn’t the only thing I had learned from the experience either. I now understood why the demon king was so worried about the human threat.They lacked brute strength, but humans had technique. They passed their techniques to each generation that followed, thereby refining them over relatively short periods of time. Every batch of humans would be stronger than the last. Of course, humans weren’t the only ones to hand down their martial arts. Demons, demi-humans, and beastkin were all sure to do the same. But they were longer lived. Their techniques passed through fewer hands in the same amount of time, and the lack of iteration led to a lesser degree of refinement. Races with longer lifespans didn’t evolve as quickly. And neither did their martial arts. That was why the humans, who had started off as a race of little note, had grown into a major power over time. Stats were only one of many measures of strength. I had to make sure to pay attention to more than just the numbers if I didn’t want the rug to be swept from under my feet.“Looks like I’ve learned a helluva lot from you, old-timer.” I muttered a few words of thanks under my breath as I turned my back to the cheering crowd and made my way to the exit.***“Ughhh… I’m so tired,” I groaned. “That old man was mad scurry.”
“Mhm. He was really strong,” agreed Enne. “How are your injuries, Master?”
“I’m fine. It’s just a few flesh wounds. I’ll just rub a few potions into them or something later.”
“Mmk.”Enne and I headed towards the waiting room whilst engaging in a bit of a chat.We weren’t the only ones present, however. I realized that we were being approached from behind, so I spun around to greet whoever was following me. And as I did, I was greeted by a pair of familiar faces.“Oh, hey girls, what’s up?” I greeted both Leila and Agent McHoodface whilst tilting my head and speaking in a questioning tone.Haloria immediately glanced around us in order to check that no one was present before leaning over and whispering into my ear.“Leila said that you’ve received an important message. The red orb of correspondence is glowing. There’s been an emergency.”Wait. What?<– Prev — Next –>

The Wingbearers’ Village — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerNell and Ronia sat in the middle of a large room with a polished wooden floor. Both wide and deep, the dojo-like facility didn’t seem even the slightest bit starved for space despite the fact that dozens upon dozens of winged individuals were crammed within it. The hawk-headed demons lined the walls as if to surround them. Their sharp gazes and deadly beaks were trained upon both the hero and her companion.Their disguises were off and their true races exposed. But they proceeded with confidence nonetheless.“We’re not seeking an alliance. We know that would be asking for far too much.” Nell spoke to the feathered man sitting across from her, the man responsible for the clan and its well being. “All we would like is for you to remain neutral, as you have been.”
“We do not take kindly to requests from the likes of mere humans,” snarled the leader in an ominous tone. He was significantly larger than her, and the feathered wings extending from his back only made his silhouette appear even larger and more intimidating.Nell, however, didn’t flinch. She refused to be overpowered by his aura regardless of how domineering it may have appeared. She spoke right back to him in a firm tone. “I was told that demons obeyed those stronger than them.”
“You were told right. We respect those that are more powerful than us so long as they conduct themselves in a manner we judge to be worthy of our praise.”
“Then obey me,” said Nell. “Because I am stronger than you. All of you.”It wasn’t a taunt. The words had left her mouth in the most indifferent of tones, as if she was merely stating a fact. And yet, it led to agitation. One of the younger wingbearers lining the walls shot to his feet and raised his weapon. It was a naginata, a mix between a sword and a spear. It had a spear’s shaft, but was tipped with a full-length sword. “You dare mock us, girl!? You are nothing but a child!”His sudden act of aggression led many more of his clansmen to ready their weapons in turn. Likewise, Ronia did the same. She raised her staff and began channelling her magical energies such that she would be able to begin casting her spells immediately.A veritable explosive situation. Even the tiniest of missteps from anyone involved could have caused the flames to surge and engulf her. But not even that was enough to faze Nell. Her gaze remained trained on the man before her, unwavering and calm despite the tense air that filled the room.“Your confidence impresses me, if nothing else,” said the wingbearer clan’s leader. “Do you truly believe that you are powerful enough to triumph against all of us at once?”
“I won’t come out of it unscathed. I’m sure to take quite a bit of damage. I might lose an arm, a leg, or maybe even both. But at the end of the day, I will be the last one standing.”
“How dare you!”The first wingbearer to have drawn his weapon continued to shout angrily, but neither the hero nor the leader of his clan paid him much mind. Nell did glance in his direction, but that was it. She turned back towards his boss immediately and continued to speak as if he hadn’t been of any importance whatsoever. “But I’m sure that you would agree to remain neutral even if I couldn’t take all of you at once.”
“And why’s that?” The clan’s head cocked an eyebrow in interest.
“Because I know that wingbearers honour duels. The others wouldn’t interfere if I challenged you to single combat.”
“You are correct. If you were to challenge me, then my people would merely stand by and watch in silence.”
“If we were to duel, I would be sure to give you a wound that would bring you to the brink of death, whether I win or lose. I’m aware that you know I’m at least strong enough to do that.”
“…” The clan’s leader narrowed his eyes, as if evaluating her.
“And if you were to lose or be brought to your deathbed, then your clan would be sure to go through a period of chaos and strife. That’s not something that you can afford given the demon realm’s current state. You don’t want to duel me because you don’t want to risk that. Listening to my suggestion and staying neutral—as you have been—would be the far better choice.”The village head took his eyes off the girl; he closed them and began to contemplate his options. Silent waves of tension pulsed through the room as Nell continued to stare straight at him nonetheless.Only after a long period of silence did he slowly reopen his eyes.“Fine.” There was a grin on his face, a wide one. “I admire your courage, girl. Your bravery makes you worthy. My clan and I will accept you as one of our own and respect your wishes. We will remain neutral, as that is what we had been planning for regardless.”The hawk-faced demon paused for a moment and narrowed his gaze once more. “But do not be mistaken. We are not willing to acknowledge or accept humankind as a whole. You and your companions are the only ones that we are willing to consider our brethren.”
“That’s good enough for us. Thank you very much,” said Nell. She breathed a sigh of relief as her lips curved up into a small smile.
“What!? What are you thinking, boss!?” The man that had stood up and pointed his naginata at Nell began screeching in disbelief.
“Enough!” The village head silenced him with a glare. “My decision is final. Have I made myself clear?
“…Of course, boss. I understand.” The pressure exerted by the village’s head caused the man to back off. He promptly bowed in a display of subservience and sat back down.
“Listen, all of you.” The chief looked around the room as he spoke. “Let it be known that you are not to harm either of these girls or their companions. They are to be regarded as our brethren. Those that do not wish to comply with my decision may now speak. Consider this your one and only opportunity to object.”None of the hawk-headed demons present dared to defy their chief. They all bowed as if acknowledging his order, which led him to nod in satisfaction.“Ah, yes, and before I forget.” He turned back to the two girls. “Were you planning on spending the night in the area?”
“We were hoping to.”
“Wonderful. Then tonight, we feast,” he said with a smile. “We will prepare a room for you at the inn. Do make sure you get enough rest to enjoy the festivities.”
“Thank you, sir. We appreciate your generosity.” Nell bowed.
“I am not doing anything you need to thank me for. I’m merely providing a powerful warrior with the respect she deserves,” said the village’s leader. “Guide! To me! Show our guest and her companions to the inn.”The man responsible for escorting the hero and her companions did as instructed and showed them to the inn. Nell felt as if there happened to be an annoyed glare boring its way into her back as she left, but she didn’t pay it much mind. She had always been fairly ignorant of ill intent to begin with, so she hadn’t thought much of it; the wingbearers were sure to warm up to her in due time.***“Ugh… I’m so tired…” The hero heaved a deep sigh as she flopped onto her bed. “I was so nervous…”
“By the looks of it, everything seems to have gone just fine.” The third member of Nell’s party spoke to the two other girls. Unlike them, she had a mature vibe. She seemed like the type of person that excelled at taking care of others. “Great job out there, you two.”While Nell and Ronia were Allysian in origin, Mekina was not; she hailed from a different nation. Given its status as one of the continent’s greatest powers, the kingdom was undoubtedly one of the greatest contributors to the operation that the hero had embarked on. But it wasn’t the only nation concerned about the demon threat. Many of the countries that Allysia was on good terms with had also contributed forces to the effort. Such was the case with Mekina’s fatherland: the Germanian Union.It wasn’t just countries either. Even some individuals not associated with any sovereign entity had joined the cause. There were all sorts of different people involved, each with their own backstory. But, goal aside, they shared one thing in common.They were humanity’s finest—and not just in terms of strength. In fact, many of them couldn’t hold their own in battle, but they were experts in their own fields nonetheless, extraordinary exceptions that ranked amongst the elite.“Nell did great,” said Ronia.
“I’m not really sure how, but I managed to pull it off,” said the hero. “I think it’s safe to say that the wingbearers will be keeping their beaks to themselves.”The reason Nell and her two companions had visited the wingbearers’ village was because fiends that they had tentatively assumed to be their enemies were passionately venturing all over the demon realm in an attempt to recruit additional allies. One of the races that they had their eyes on was the one that Nell had just finished negotiating with. The wingbearers were one of the demon realm’s most influential groups. And yet, they had chosen not to ally themselves with either of the two major powers. The moment they changed their stance was the moment the balance of power would be broken, the demon realm would be swallowed by war.It was easy to imagine that a massive war in the demon realm would have consequences beyond it. Many human nations were sure to use it as an opportunity to declare war and initiate campaigns far more aggressive than any currently active. Demons and humans would once again dye the battlefields in copious amounts of blood. And the larger the demon realm’s conflict, the more aggressive the humans would become. That was why Nell had to step in. She had to try her best to grow the neutral faction and keep the scale of the conflict to come as small as she could. Bolstering the number of neutrals meant abiding by one of war’s most basic principles: taking away from the enemies’ forces and bolstering one’s own.As demonstrated by the wingbearers, clans that chose to negotiate often were willing to accept Nell, to view her as their own. If she continued to do exactly that, then there was a chance she could very well bring the conflict as a whole to a close, that she could end the long-standing feud between humankind and its nemesis.That was why many nations and individuals had chosen to involve themselves. To crush the smolders that plagued their homes.“I know I have to seem really confident since demons respect strength, but it’s really not my thing.”Seeing Nell complain as she rolled around on top of her mattress led Ronia to giggle.“You messed up badly and made them angry. Thankfully, their boss is smart.”
“Ughhh…I know, you don’t have to remind me,” groaned the hero. “I know I can win if it comes to a fight, but it would be a really close one. I’m glad we managed to avoid it.”
“Why, that sounds terrible,” said Mekina. “Is that chief of theirs really that strong?”
“He is! I’d have a really hard time beating him. But I think Mr. Remiero would be able to win hands down.”
“Well, of course he would. He may have retired already, but he is still the realm’s most powerful adventurer. If he can’t beat someone, then no human can.” Mekina leaked a small sigh before continuing. “I’m sorry girls. I wish I could help, but I’m no good when it comes to a fight.”
“It’s okay,” said Ronia in a matter-of-fact manner. “I’m just as much of a burden. Demons are just too strong.”Her knowledge over the mystic arts was second to none. She was quite literally one of the world’s most powerful human mages, matched only by a few select individuals. And yet, even she was outclassed by demons. That wasn’t to say that every single demon was a more powerful caster than her. There were many different types of demons, and each had different strengths. Some demon mages were far weaker than Ronia. However, those that were more magically inclined had her totally beat.That was why, unlike Nell, she wasn’t meant to be out on the front lines. Her role wasn’t to fight. It was to provide support in the form of cover and backup.“You may not be the best fighters, but you two are still really important,” said Nell whilst pumping her fists. “You can do all sorts of things that I can’t. I know that I’ve still got a ways to go, but I’ll try my best to keep both of you safe.”
“I’m sure you’ll do a wonderful job of it,” giggled Mekina.
“And we’ll pay you back by covering for your weaknesses,” added Ronia.
“Thank you. Both of you.” The hero spoke with a big, happy smile. Having her companions by her side reassured her; the moaning and groaning that she had been so eagerly engaged in even just a few minutes prior was nowhere to be seen.

The Wingbearers’ Village — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe high pitched ringing of steel echoed across the battlefield. For a few seconds, the sound was replicated each time it faded. But then, it disappeared. In its place was a dull clattering as one of the two weapons responsible for the ringing fell to the ground.“…I concede.” A now empty-handed man muttered the two words quietly under his breath. His naginata had been blown away and his enemy’s blade had been pressed against his neck. He was vexed, but there was nothing he could do. The duel was over. He had lost.
“Thank you. It was a good match.” Nell smiled as she pulled her practice sword away from her opponent’s neck.A stir ran through the crowd. Seeing her triumph over the warrior had caused many wingbearers to raise their voices and discuss the results with those next to them.“I expected nothing less,” said the village’s chief. “Even my most powerful warriors have found themselves bested by your blade.”
“I am sorry, boss. I have lost.” The wingbearer moved to the edge of the ring and kneeled before the village head, who happened to be sitting just outside of it with his legs crossed.
“That is fine. She may be human, but she is strong. Do not worry, I am not disappointed in you. All that matters is that you learn from the experience.”
“Then I believe that all is as you wished, sir. It was an eye-opening experience.” Though he was muttering under his breath, the wingbearer Nell had defeated spoke in a tone that could only be described as earnest. He wasn’t lying. Losing the battle truly had expanded his worldview.It was night time, and the festival was already underway. The hero and her companions had been led from their hotel to the village’s downtown area as the celebrations began. There, they had found a large ring, one obviously meant for combat.All three of the girls had immediately eyed it suspiciously, but it faded into the background as the village head gave a toast to their arrival. Only about halfway through the night did it finally get mentioned again. The wingbearers’ boss had asked Nell to show his people her strength. She realized that accepting would provide her with an opportunity to earn the respect of those that had yet to warm up to her, so she had done exactly that. She dueled three of his handpicked elites and defeated them one after another. Demonstrating her strength proved worthwhile. It ultimately served to make the feast even livelier than it had already been.Though she had bested all her challengers in single combat, Nell’s strength and vitality stats weren’t all that abnormal from a demon’s standpoint. They were high, but weren’t high enough to take the village by storm. It was her skill with the sword that led her newfound brethren to acknowledge her superiority.Nell was of the dextrous variety. She had always known how to use her hands. Her natural talent was put into full bloom as she was taught the way of the blade—as she was taught to wield the heroic might that lay within her. Nell sucked up the techniques bestowed to her like a sponge would water. It didn’t take long for her to far outclass the average swordsman. And that talent of hers had only blossomed further in the past few weeks. The one on one instruction provided to her by one of her travelling companions had allowed her to realize the essence of the art. Though he was dressed like a butler, he helped further her technical skill at an even faster rate than ever before.Unlike demonic techniques, which involved leading heavy clashes in which both parties could exert the full extent of their brute strength, martial arts developed by humans focused on finesse. Emphasis was placed on individual, highly technical moves as opposed to matching one’s foes with naught but power. As such, humans had the upper hand when it came to swordplay despite their lack of strength and vitality.She had come a long way since she was first christened the church’s hero. Nell had already become so powerful that she could defeat several notable demons in a row without becoming short of breath, but she wasn’t done just yet. She still had plenty of room for growth.“That was a fine display of skill, Nell,” said the village’s chief. “Thank you. I believe that should be enough to convince those that had yet to accept my decision that, though you are human, you are worthy of being considered one of our brethren.”
“I should be the one thanking you. You gave me the perfect opportunity to prove myself. I just hope that it was enough to convince everyone.”
“I doubt that my people will continue disapproving of you after seeing such a wonderful series of duels. Do inform me if there appears to be anyone hostile, and I will resolve the issue personally. But that is enough of that for now. The night’s event is a feast, and I wish not to waste any more of your time. Please, enjoy it to your heart’s content,” said the chief with a hearty laugh.
“Thank you very much, sir. I’ll do exactly that,” smiled Nell.Evidently, defeating three of the clan’s more powerful warriors had worked. The village’s people flocked to Nell as soon as she was free and bombarded her with questions about the secret to her strength. And so, she spent the rest of the feast surrounded by friends both old and new.***It happened late at night, long after all the evening’s festivities had come to an end. There wasn’t even a hint of moonlight within the pitch black room. The only sounds that could be heard were the rhythmic breaths taken by the three girls sleeping within it—and the creaking of a door.Several figures dressed from head to toe in black entered the scene. Each noiselessly slipped from shadow to shadow as they approached the targets they were assigned. And as they neared, they drew from their robes a set of daggers, each dripping with a viscous, toxic substance.They reached the girls’ bedsides in sync and raised their daggers overhead. But they weren’t provided the opportunity to deliver the fatal blows that they had hoped for.“You’re attacking illusions.”A female voice prompted all three would be cutthroats to spin around and face one of the room’s corners. There, they saw one of the girls they had marked as a target with her staff raised. None of them managed to fully wrap their heads around the situation, but they at least understood that one of their targets was up and about. They immediately shifted targets to the active threat and charged at her.“Sleep.”But they were too slow. She muttered the name of her spell before they could reach her and caused all three robed assailants to collapse where they stood.“Done.”
“Thanks, Ronia,” said Nell.
“That was wonderfully done,” said Mekina.The layer of darkness that covered both of Ronia’s companions vanished as the spell concealing them undid itself.“I couldn’t have done it without you, Mekina. I wouldn’t have noticed them.” The mage shook her head.
“I totally didn’t realize we were under attack either,” said Nell. “I would have just kept sleeping. So thanks, Mekina. We really owe you one.”
“I’m just doing my job, girls,” she said with a wry grin. “They’d have long fired me if I couldn’t do at least this much.”Unlike the other two, Mekina was an intelligence operative. She had two jobs. The first was to detect enemies in order to keep her allies ready and alert. By nature of occupation, she was extremely sensitive to the nearby presence of enemies. Being asleep hadn’t stopped her from realizing that hostiles were approaching their room, so she had gotten up and warned the others before they were subject to the nocturnal assault.Mekina’s other role was, as her title implied, to gather intelligence. And that was why she hadn’t joined the two in meeting with the leader of the wingbearers. She had been too busy using the opportunity to scrape up any information she could get. She had used not wanting to get in the way of negotiations as an excuse to be placed in another room. The Germanian spy made it seem as if she was standing by and idling around as any other guest would, but she actually spent the entire time investigating the wingbearers and learning everything she could.“You aren’t as good as Mekina, but you would’ve noticed it before me if you weren’t drunk,” said Ronia. “You had way too much today.”
“I couldn’t help myself…” Nell covered her face with her hands and turned her eyes away from her friend in embarrassment. “The wine they had was really, really good.”Her pitifully bad excuse caused Ronia to heave an exasperated sigh and Mekina to giggle.“R-right, so who are these guys anyway?” She knew it didn’t justify or rationalize her actions in any which way, so she immediately changed the topic whilst directing her gaze towards the men passed out on the floor. Ronia’s spell had drained them of their consciousness and put them in a deep sleep.
“Aren’t they just wingbearers?” asked Ronia.
“It doesn’t seem like they are.” Mekina used her foot to roll one of the men over and unveil his face.
“Oh. They don’t have beaks.” The mage immediately realized that their assailants were missing the wingbearers’ characteristic hawk-like faces.
“Goodness, there are so many different types of demons,” sighed Mekina. “I have no idea which race these men belong to.”
“Then how about we ask the chief? He’d probably know,” said Nell.Nell perked her ears up the moment she stopped talking, and not because she was waiting for one of her friends to respond. As the person standing closest to the window, she happened to catch a bit of an odd, unnatural sound. She immediately moved over to the window, opened it, and looked outside.“What…?” The first thing that she did after making use of the elevated perspective her position on the second floor provided her with was gawk in confusion.It was a melee. Wingbearers and people dressed from head to toe in black were all over the place with their blades crossed. And now that the window was open, the sounds coming from the village were clear to her. Screams and battlecries were accompanied by the clanging of metal.Her relative proximity to the island, or rather, lack thereof, had prevented her from noticing the odd state that had overcome the wingbearers’ settlement in the middle of the night. Battles were happening literally everywhere. Wingbearers and men in black were attacking one another in the open.One of the aforementioned fights was happening not too far from where Nell was situated. One of her beaked friends was locked in a duel with one of the mysterious assailants. A second was sneaking up from behind him, but the feathered warrior hadn’t even the slightest clue.“Oh no! That’s not good!” Nell looked down from the windowsill and hesitated for a moment. The second floor was pretty high up off the ground. That said, she knew that she couldn’t afford to wait, so she clenched her teeth, stepped onto the windowsill, and jumped.“Nell!?” Ronia shouted at the hero in surprise, but she didn’t respond.After experiencing a moment’s worth of floating, Nell bent her knees to disperse the inevitable force of the impact that came with landing, and in that same motion, kicked off the ground with as much strength as she could muster. She shot across the ground like a rocket and swung her blade at the cloaked man in the midst of positioning himself behind the bird-faced warrior.He managed to avoid it. But he was unable to do anything more. He was caught by the follow up that came as she twisted her waist and drove her blade into his torso. The life faded from him as he coughed up a mouthful of blood.His death didn’t seem to come as much more than a nuisance to his companion, as the other cloaked figure didn’t offer even a word of grief. He clicked click his tongue in annoyance before leaping away from the wingbearer he was in the midst of fighting. He then retreated from the disadvantageous two-on-one situation by melting into the darkness of the night.“Thank you. I owe you my life.”
“It’s okay. Don’t worry about it,” said Nell. “Do you know who the guys that just attacked you are?”Upon closer inspection, Nell realized that the wingbearer was one of the ones working as a guard, so she immediately probed him for further information. However, provide information he could not. The man, who wore a set of brilliant obsidian armour and wielded a naginata like every other wingbearer warrior, shook his head.“I haven’t the slightest clue. They suddenly appeared out of nowhere and began attacking us without a word. I apologize, but I am worried for the chief’s safety. I believe that you should be fine given the extent of your strength, but I suggest you evacuate immediately nonetheless.”The warrior flapped his wings and began heading back towards the village’s center.“Nell!”Hearing her name prompted Nell to spin around. There, she saw Mekina and Ronia headed towards her. Their expressions indicated that they too had realized that the situation was more grave than expected, that they weren’t the only ones under attack.“I’m terribly sorry, dear,” said Mekina. “I should have had a better grasp of our situation, but I didn’t think much of it because there were only a few enemies near the inn.”
“It’s not your fault, Mekina,” said Nell. “What did you do to the people that attacked us?”
“We stripped them and tied them up,” said Ronia. “Now what?”Nell frowned as she paused for a moment to consider their options. Ronia’s question effectively meant that she wished to know whether Nell wished to run or fight. The first thing the hero did was to consider what Yuki would do in her shoes. That alone made her path clear.“Let’s go help the chief,” she said. “I’m sure they’ll be needing as many hands as they can get.”The hero knew that Yuki wasn’t the type to abandon people. He would do his best to save everyone he could. She could see him smiling the same way he usually did as he easily crushed his enemies by smashing his way through everything they threw at him. Although he was a demon lord, his example was what drove her actions of heroism. The fact that she held herself to his standard was ironic if anything, but she sought to imitate and learn from him regardless. She was convinced that his example was exactly what she needed to follow. Because she knew that he would never let those that needed him down. That he wouldn’t run away.And as a hero, she couldn’t either. Choosing escape in the face of danger would reduce her to nothing but a laughing stock.“That’s a wonderful idea,” said Mekina. “I would at least like to gather enough information to understand who these mysterious assailants are.”
“Should we use the orb of correspondence?”
“No. We don’t know what’s happening yet.” Nell shook her head in response to the court mage’s question. “I think we should go with Mekina’s suggestion and figure out who we’re being attacked by.”
“Yes, let’s,” nodded Mekina.And so the curtain rose on what the three of them would find to be a long, grueling, exhausting day.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: Playing Pretend
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix“Mwahahahahahaha! It is impossible for you pitiful demon lords to defeat I, the hero that serves as an avatar of evil itself!” I cackled before speaking in what could only be described as an over-exaggerated, sinister-sounding tone.
“That’s not true at all!” The demon lord named Illuna raised her voice in protest. “We’ve got the power of friendship! All we have to do to beat you is work together!”Her words served as a cue to prompt all six demon lords to line up next to each other.“Then try it. Try it, and I shall prove you wrong!” I said. “Come, Leficios! Your master beckons!”
“Mwahahahaha! You cannot defeat me, children.” Though she was trying her best, Lefi wasn’t exactly what one could call accustomed to role play. As such, she ended up speaking her line in a monotone fashion as she unfolded her wings and took to the skies.
“Oh come on Lefi! Flying isn’t fair!” said Illuna.
“I see not the reason for your complaint. Honour is of little relevance in the face of victory,” she said. “Or are you perhaps simply so weak willed and undeserving of your titles that a mere winged creature is enough to bring you to your knees?”
“A point well made, minion,” I said. “Now destroy them! Destroy them as they wallow in hopelessness and despair!”
“…Was I not acting the part of a hero’s subordinate? I am quite certain that such a feat would serve to contradict my role.”
“Don’t sweat the details. The hero’s evil, so this is pretty much normal.”Our momentary exchange proved to be a fatal opening. The demon lords managed to come up with a plan as we conversed.“It’s okay girls, I’ve figured it out! I know Lefi’s, erm, the hero’s minion’s weakness!” shouted Illuna! “Rui, it’s all up to you! You know what you need to do!”Her words led one of the wraith sisters to nod whilst wearing her usual, determined expression. She began to wield her greatest weapon, her illusion magic, and launched an attack on Lefi.“I-I cannot believe my eyes!” said the dragon. “Could that be the fabled kast-ellah?”You know, I never did figure out why Lefi thinks Castella is the stuff of myths. Oh well, whatever. The illusory sponge cake slowly drifted towards the silver-haired maiden, who involuntarily began reaching towards it despite the fact that she knew it was an illusion.“Rei! Lowe! Now!”Lefi was immediately assaulted by two additional sets of magic. Rei used psychokinesis to bind her body in place while Lowe used mind magic to mess with her sense of direction. The combination of the two effects caused her to rapidly lose altitude. It didn’t take long for her to spiral face first into the true throne room’s carpet.“Curses!” shouted the dragon. As the most powerful creature in the world, Lefi could have nullified both spells with minimal effort. That, however, happened to be against the rules, which stated that anyone caught off guard by any sort of magic must bear the full brunt of its effects.“Let’s go, everyone! Tickle the heck out of her!”Lefi immediately tried to get back up, but found herself underneath a pile of little girls before she could, with all of them taking part in the tickle-based assault. Even the wraiths took part by manipulating the dolls that they had possessed.“C-Cease this immediately!” She managed to squeeze out a few words between laughs and gasps, but to no avail. They didn’t stop until she was done for.She was completely out of breath when they finally got off of her. The dragon lay on the ground with her arms and legs spread wide, her clothes disheveled, and her breaths laced with heavy pants. The sight was so indecent that I judged it improper to stare.“D-Dude, please…er, I mean, I see that it has taken you little effort to defeat my minion. I suppose I shall offer you the tip of a hat.”
“Master, what does a tip of a hat mean?”
“It means I’m acknowledging you guys,” I said. “Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah. Very well, I shall deal with you personally. Unlike that imbecile, I am not to be trifled with.”
“H-how dare you!” panted Lefi, indignantly. “I am no imbecile!”Suuuuuuure. You know, I’d totally be willing to believe that if it wasn’t coming from the idiot that ended up getting beat up ‘cause she lost to her own sweet tooth.“Rei! Rui! Lowe!”All three responded to Illuna’s call and immediately began casting their best spells—but my magic eye allowed me to grasp them ahead of time, so I dodged them with ease.“A meaningless attempt! You are too naive, demon lords. Your strategy will not work, for I am the most powerful hero that has ever been!”
“Hmrghh…” groaned Illuna. “He’s really strong. We’re all going to need to work together if we want to beat him up! Shii, Enne, you two know what to do!”Both girls immediately nodded in acknowledgement and jumped right at me.“Woah! Come on girls, be more careful. That’s pretty dangerous!”Neither showed much in the way of restraint with regards to their lunges, nor did they bother thinking as to what might happen if they missed. The only choice I had was to catch them.“I knew you would do that, Yuk-, er, hero! We’ve got you now! Rei, Rui, Lowe! Do it!”The wraith girls joined the fray by clinging to me in order to restrain me.“Now take this!”
“Oh, crap!”Finally, the demon lord known as Illuna lunged right at my torso. I couldn’t really move anymore due to the sheer number of little girls I was covered in, so the attack ended up knocking me over.“We win now, right?” asked Illuna.
“Right?” echoed Shii.
“Victory.” While the first two girls spoke with voices filled with energy, Enne spoke in a much more neutral tone. However, that wasn’t to say she was inexpressive. She made sure to supplement her lack of vocalization by holding up a pair of peace signs.
“Kh… Very well. I admit my loss. You are powerful,” I said. “But this is not over. I shall now show you my true power, my second form!”Although I made mention of a second form, I didn’t bother actually transforming or anything. I just ended up standing back up even while decked with little girls before starting to spin around.“Wheeeeee!” shouted Illuna. “This is fun! Go faster! Faster!”
“Faster!” said Shii.Unlike the girls, the wraiths weren’t able to scream to express their excitement, but the way they were responding made it obvious that they were enjoying the experience nonetheless.“Make sure you hang on tight!” I said with a cackle.I spun around for a good bit, slowly ramping up my speed as I went. Naturally, I couldn’t keep it up forever, so I ended up plopping back down onto the carpet once I hit my limit.“Oh man, that’s enough of that. My eyes are spinning,” I said. “Everyone still okay?”
“Yup! That was really fun, so I’m totally okay!” said Illuna.
“…Mhm.” nodded Enne.
“You should join us too, Lefi! It’s fun!” said Shii.The girl that the slime smiled at heaved an exaggerated, exasperated sigh. She had finally recovered from the tickle-based assault she had been subjected to.“That’s a solid idea,” I said. “Well Lefi, your beloved husband just so happens to have an arm free, just for you, so how about you get over here?”
“Hmph,” she snorted. “Very funny.”Despite ridiculing the offer, she briskly walked over and sat down nearby regardless.“Oh, would you look at that! Looks like someone’s being a lot less shy than usual. Why the change?” I raised an eyebrow in suspicion as Lefi suddenly glomped me, her lips twisted into a playful grin.
“Demon lords, I have provided you an opportunity! Assault him immediately! I shall keep him restrained!”
“Huh? Wait! Nonononono! Ahahaharhrahgahra!?”With Lefi as their newfound leader, the girls went all out and began tickling me with everything they had. Their tiny hands crawled all over my body and prompted me to exhaust myself with laughter. I wanted to escape, but I couldn’t. Lefi demonstrated that her title wasn’t just for show by ensuring that I remained unable to move a muscle.“H-hold on! Time out! Time! Out! Seriously, wait! Wait, wait wait! Just one second!”
“We shan’t,” said Lefi. “You did not wait when it was I that played victim. You watched as I had no choice but to bear being tickled to the point of exhaustion. And now it has come time for just retribution. Demon lords, do not hold back! Continue to assault him with all you have!”
“I-I’m definitely getting you back for this, Lefi!” I shouted. I managed to scream a few words at her between stifled giggles, but I ended up breaking into an all out laugh before I could really give her a piece of my mind.
“I suppose I too shall participate. I am certain I know precisely where you would love to be attacked.”She took her arms, which she had been using to hold me down, off of me, and began using her legs to fulfill the role instead. Her newly freed forelimbs were then immediately joined in on the tickling.“Dammit, weren’t you supposed to be my minion!? The hell happened to that, you traitor!?”
“These young demon lords have shown me the err of my ways, and my defeat has provided me with a change of heart. I understand now that it is none other than my purpose in life to cull you, to bring this world’s greatest evil to its knees!”
“Wow uh, is it just me, or are you being a bit too disloyal?”Like, come on… It’s not like you lost ‘cause something hit you in the feels or something either. All they did was make you hallucinate about some sort of stupid cake!“Fine. If you want me to play my trump card that bad, then I’ll just go ahead and do it,” I said with a click of the tongue. “What do you girls want for dinner tonight?”
“W-What is the matter, young demon lords? Why do you pause?”Lefi aside, everyone had frozen in place the moment I brought up our evening meal.“Demon lords. I offer you an alliance. Let us join hands to punish this traitorous fool! I shall provide you with a dish of your choice should you choose to lend me your power! As for those of you that sustain yourselves with mana, I shall provide you with as much as you could possibly consume.”
“Yay! I want chocolate cornets!” said Illuna.
“…Donuts,” said Enne.
“I want mana!” said Shii.The three girls capable of vocalization cheered while the three that weren’t floated around blissfully. Unlike regular creatures, the dungeon’s monsters sustained themselves on magical energy. And mine was effectively their favourite dish. Under normal circumstances, giving one’s magic to another was extremely difficult. The person doing the giving would have to modify the nature of their magic and tune it to match that of the receiver. Fortunately, providing my monsters with mana came with exactly none of that hassle.Like me, my monsters were born of the dungeon’s essence. Their mana was ultimately sourced from the same place as mine, which made their wavelengths incredibly similar to my own. I could feed them as much as I wished without any of the hassle that would have normally accompanied it.“How unethical! Foul play at its finest!” cried Lefi.
“Mwahahahahaha! Take that, traitor! He who controls the most little girls controls the flow of this battle,” I cackled. “It appears that your endgame is weak. Victory is mine!”The situation at hand underwent a perfect 180; it was my turn to be on offence. There wasn’t a moment to lose. I immediately pushed the girl that had been sitting on top of me down and joined my newfound companions in a vicious assault on her dainty frame.“C-Cease this at once! S-Stop it! I am sorry! No more! I beg of you!”
“Do not think that your prattling will provide any merit,” I said. “You betrayed me in the face of all my sinister charm! And for that, you will pay!”With an evil laugh as my cue, I immediately went for one of the most ticklish spots on Lefi’s body.“N-No! Not the tail! Do not tickle my tail!!” She managed to scream a few words of resistance, but it was to no avail.
“Making an enemy of me was but a fool’s errand, Leficios! For I know all of your weaknesses!”To reiterate, Lefi could have easily shaken me off. But she wasn’t able to resist. She couldn’t. Shaking me off would mean shaking the girls off as well, and she didn’t want to hurt them. The dragon had no choice but to sit tight as we did whatever we pleased. Heh. You see this? This is called strategy. ‘Cause you know, there’s more to strength than just brute force.Yeah, and I know what you’re thinking. This whole thing might seem a little… suggestive. I kinda pushed a girl down, got on top of her, and started touching her literally wherever I wanted without her consent. But uhhh… you see, officer, I’m totally innocent. Perversion? What’s that? Never heard of it in my life, sir, I swear. Anyway, where was I again? Oh yeah. Heh. Suffer, Lefi! Suffer and sink into the depths of despair! Mwahahahahaha!A few minutes was all it took to turn Lefi into a bedraggled mess. She lay collapsed on the ground with drool oozing from the side of her mouth. Her breathing was ragged and her clothes were as disorderly as they could have possibly been. She shivered each time I poked her side. To be completely honest, the only term that came to mind as I looked upon her was “erotic.” Like, seriously. Goddamn, that’s hot as hell.“Lunch is ready!” Lyuu poked her head out of the kitchen and announced it was mealtime the same way she usually did, only to get an eye full of lewd. “W-wait a second, what’s goin’ on here!? A-Are you okay, Lefi? You’re breathin’ real weird!”
“Eh, no need to concern yourself with her,” I said. “This is just what happens to traitors.”
“We’ve triumphed over evil!” declared Illuna!
“Yup! We beat a baddy!” said Shii.The two raised their arms energetically as they summed up the results of our game of make-believe. Is it just me, or is what they’re saying kinda different from what I’m saying? Oh well, whatever.“W-Well, alright…” said Lyuu, taken aback. “A-anyway, I just wanted to tell everyone that it’s ‘bout time for lunch ‘cause we’ve just about everythin’ done.”
“Got it,” I said. “Alright girls, how about we go get ready for lunch.”
“Okay!” said Illuna and Shii in sync.
“…Mmk,” nodded Enne.The girls ran off to help set the table and left me alone with the victim of all our tickling.“Come on Lefi, get up. It’s time for food.”
“H-How dare you remain so unconcerned after such an assault on my body. I shall see to—”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough of that,” I said. “All that’s doing is making me wanna mess with you even more.”I poked her in the side as I spoke, which prompted her to twitch and squeal before turning towards me with an adorable, teary look in her eyes.“V-Very well. I understand,” she said. “I shall obey, so do not continue to poke me.”“…”Poke.Again, Lefi squealed. “I-I have already sworn that I would obey! Why is it that you do not cease!?”
“Sorry. Seeing you act like that is just making me really want to bully you some more.”
“H-How terrible! I cannot see you as anything but a lawless monster!”
“My bad, my bad,” I chuckled as I extended my hand to her. “Anyway, let’s get going before lunch gets cold, alright?”
“How little integrity you have. It is simply abnormal for one to go from tormenting another to offering them a hand in a matter of moments.”Though she spoke in a reproachful tone and flashed me a bitter glare, the dragon girl took my hand nonetheless.All I did in response was flash my usual shit-eating grin as I pulled her to her feet.<– Prev — Next –>

Hero — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe wingbearers’ settlement was a sizeable one. It wasn’t quite big enough to be labelled a city, but at the very least, it was no mere hamlet. That was why it seemed odd that the entire village had been drowned in the flames of war. Nell herself had already experienced several encounters. Each time, she worked with nearby wingbearer warriors in order to fend off their hooded assailants. The situation at hand was an awful one. And it only seemed to be getting worse. The clashing of blades grew louder and more frequent as the hero and her companions approached the village’s center.“They’re too coordinated for this to be some random attack.” Mekina’s expression turned grim as she looked upon her surroundings. Her words came in a low, contemplative mutter. “It has to be a military operation.”
“Right,” said Ronia. “They’re clearly targeting the wingbearers. We just got unlucky and got caught in the crossfire.”While the court mage wasn’t exactly the type of girl that liked to wear her emotions on her sleeves, they just so happened to be written all over her face at this exact moment. Her gaze was sharpened; she was clearly on guard.“Whatever the case, let’s keep pushing forward,” said Nell. “The only thing we can do right now is to get there as quickly as we can.”Both of the hero’s companions abided by her words and remained silent as they continued their journey in earnest. Only after a few minutes of running and skirmishing did they finally arrive at their destination. The first thing they did was hide themselves behind a nearby building. Observation was the key word—they looked upon the scenario in order to glean what they could before getting too caught up in the battle to see the big picture. Their investigations immediately led them to discover that most of the village’s warriors were gathered around a large house just north of the town square.Like the rest of the village, flames decorated the central building’s vicinity. There were literally bonfires everywhere. Structures had been razed—and not only by the men in black. The wingbearers had pulled down one of their own watchtowers and converted it into a temporary barricade. Most nearby conflicts were centered around it. Wingbearers and men in black alike clashed both in front of and behind the defensive structure. That said, only the unknowns were negatively affected by its presence. Unlike the winged warriors, they were unable to take to the skies and circumvent it with minimal effort.Hopping the wall wasn’t the only advantage that the ability to fly had brought the hawk-faced fighters. Their wings allowed them to easily maneuver in all three dimensions, thereby expanding their options in battle. The sky was their ally, one with which they had a longstanding relationship. So practiced were their movements that even an amateur could easily tell that they were well accustomed to aerial combat.“There are too many of them for us to sneak past.” Nell frowned as she looked upon the countless enemies in her way. “I’ll break right through the front! Make sure you two stay right behind me!”She didn’t bother waiting for either of her companions to answer before shooting into the fray like an arrow from a fully drawn bow. The hero trusted her friends enough to know that they were sure to follow.They couldn’t react to her. The men in black, whose affiliation remained unknown, were too busy dealing with the wingbearers’ aerial assault to evade her holy sword’s edge. They could do nothing but fall to Durandal as she and her companions charged right through their ranks and leapt over the barricade.“Was this invasion your doing, girl?” An angry roar reached her ears the moment she landed on the other side of the fallen tower. The chief of the wingbearers had spoken, his voice laced with malice, rage, and suspicion.
“Y-you’ve got it all wrong!” said Nell. “This has nothing to do with us!”Her protests did little to quell his anger. Fortunately, she wasn’t alone in the endeavor.“Please calm yourself, sir! I can attest that she means us no harm. She saved my life, among many others.” A nearby warrior approached the chief and made a case for the human and her companions.While she was grateful for his help, Nell couldn’t quite pinpoint the identity of the man that had come to her aid. It wasn’t her fault. Wingbearers were so different from humans that the latter found it difficult to tell members of the former apart. Only the chief was particularly easy to distinguish. He was so much more muscular than the rest of his tribesmen that he stood out like a sore thumb. Though she didn’t recognize him, his words alone were enough to evidence that it was one of the many she had assisted on her way to the town square.The chief closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself. Having one of his own explain the situation quickly convinced the chief that the girl wasn’t lying. “I am sorry. I should not have jumped to conclusions. Thank you for helping my people.”
“It’s okay, I understand,” said Nell. “More importantly, do you know what’s going on?”
“I am under the impression that we are being attacked by the fiends,” said the chief. “I do not know the precise race of our assailants, but I believe I have seen them amongst the fiends’ members. However, I cannot confirm my suspicions. They have yet to relay their intentions. We were attacked without a word.”
“The fiends…?”Nell furrowed her brow. It was a familiar name—one she would have preferred not to hear. He had told her that they were his enemies, so she had tentatively marked them as hers as well. The hero knew that if the chief’s guess was on point, then it would mean that they were up against agents from one of the demon realm’s two most powerful factions.“The lack of light that accompanies the moon puts us at a sure disadvantage. Our eyes lose most of their function in the darkness,” said the chief. “However, we wingbearers remain a race of warriors. This is not anywhere near enough to force us to yield. Our honourless assailants have underestimated us. And for that, we will show them that they are fools!”He brandished his naginata, which like his frame, was significantly larger than that of the other wingbearers. The wind almost seemed to screech as his blade tore through both it and the nearest enemy.“We’ll help!” said Nell. “Ronia, use your magic to back everyone up! Mekina, take care of the wounded!”
“Roger,” said the mage.
“Sure thing, dear,” said the intelligence officer.
“I am sorry, humans.” The chief lowered his head. “It appears that you have been caught in our troubles.”
“You acknowledged us as your sisters in arms, chief. And we plan to play the part. We won’t abandon you in your time of need!”Nell’s voice was firm, unwavering, and full of conviction—a fact that put a wide grin on the wingbearer’s face.“You said that you guys see much better when there’s light, right?” asked Nell.
“That is correct. We do not see well in the darkness. But with sufficient light, our vision becomes one of our most powerful tools. We are able to see far beyond even those distant hills should the sun be at its peak.Wingbearers were effectively nightblind. That was in part why the village was aflame. The winged warriors had sacrificed their own homes in order to better see their foes. Of course, the fiends knew this too. Both sides had designated the flames as key points of contention.“I’ve got just the thing.” The hero raised her divine blade up above her head and chanted a spell. “I beseech the spirits of my ancestors! Heed my call! Illuminate my path! Sacred Shine!”A glowing orb emerged from Durandal’s tip, ascended into the sky, and began raining light down on its surroundings. The rays it emitted were powerful enough to make her surroundings appear the same way they would at noon. But like the sun, the light emitted from the orb was more gentle than overbearing, more warm than scorching hot.“Thank you. That is exactly what we needed!” said the chief. “Men! Let us engage our foes! Take up your arms and deliver them to hell!”The wingbearers roared. Nell’s light had provided them with everything they needed to see not only their enemies, but each other. With their spirits ablaze and their weapons at the ready, the warriors began working together and rapidly mowing down their black-robed enemies. Seeing the sudden burst of momentum soothed Nell’s anxiety and filled her with confidence. Things were looking up. It only seemed to be a matter of time before the wingbearers achieved total victory.“Chief!”
“Oh, well would you look at that? It is the idiot I call my son. What has kept you from joining us in glorious combat?”A young, fully armoured wingbearer approached the chief. Despite not being able to tell individuals apart, Nell felt as if she recognized him. The colour of a wingbearer’s plumes would change as they grew older, and the individual before the chief just so happened to have a very distinctive set of shades.Seeing Nell’s confusion, Ronia whispered into her friend’s ear and informed her of his identity. “That’s the guy that started yelling when we were talking with the chief.”
“Right…”The mage’s reminder was more than enough to trigger the hero’s memories. She hadn’t realized that the man her words had offended was the chief’s son. The revelation was a nice one to have, but it didn’t really seem to mean much to her, so she raised her sword and prepared herself to engage the men assaulting the village.Only for all her plans to fall apart.The chief coughed. Blood dribbled from his lips and fell onto the blade that had been driven into his chest.By his son.“Chief!?”
“Boss!?”
“Get out of my way! I must attend to our leader!”The wingbearers were shaken. Many of their warriors immediately shoved the men in black aside and attempted to make their way over to the man to whom they had sworn their fealty. But they couldn’t. Their enemies engaged them before they could retreat and forced them to continue swinging their halberds.“You… traitor…!” The wingbearer’s words were distorted by the blood welling up within his throat. His heavy frame heaved as it desperately tried to take in the air it required to function.
“Hmph.” Rather than grieving for his wounded parent, the younger warrior did nothing but scoff as he drew a bloody knife from the wounded man’s chest. “You have gone senile, father. You are no longer the patriarch you were in your youth. It is time for you to step down.”Only after seeing more blood did Nell finally unfreeze. She dashed towards the pair and slashed at the chief’s assailant. Evading it was the best he could do; she was too quick for him to counter. But rather than following up and finishing him, she chose to grab the man that had proclaimed her his sister in arms and withdrew to safety.“Mekina!”
“I’m on it, dear!”The most mature of the three women ran over to the chief’s side and reached to treat his wounds, only to be pushed away by the injured warrior himself.“Please calm down, sir. You really shouldn’t be moving around with a wound that deep!” she said.
“This… is nothing… A mere… flesh wound…”His breathing was ragged and his words accompanied by clots of blood. Blood spilled from his core, leaked from his chest, and splattered all over the ground beneath him. He was heavily injured. Yet, he had refused to be disarmed; the grip he had on his naginata had never once loosened. He used the weapon as a crutch to prop himself up onto one knee before rising to his feet.“So it… was you…” His words were laced with dissatisfaction and just anger. “It was you… who brought these… assailants into our lands…”
“That’s right, father. I’ve joined forces with the fiends, the only men truly worthy of being named our brethren.”
“You fool…” sighed the chief. “How low you have fallen… I did not think… that my very own son… would succumb to their temptations…”
“Say what you will, father, but your time is over. The wingbearer tribe is no longer yours to command! It is we who will rule it in your place!”It was a cue. His words prompted several dozen wingbearers to flock to his side. All of them were as he was, young, foolish, and proud to the point of degeneracy.“It is over, father! This land will be your grave!”
“You wish to kill me? Fine! Try it!” The chief took up a two-handed stance despite his still bleeding wound. “You are all fools. As the chief of our people, it is my duty to devote all I have to your reeducation.”
“I suppose these words are wasted on you now that you’re on the verge of death, but you really should’ve listened to us.” One of the men in black sneered at the chief as his allies gathered around him. “None of this would’ve happened if you’d just obeyed.”
“Hah! What a ruse!” The chief laughed. “You are a coward. You rely on underhanded schemes and ill-gotten gains! We have no loyalty for the likes of you! Now fight me! Challenge me in droves like the dishonourable scum you are! I will use my blade to seek recompense for the attack you have ordered on my people!”His battlecry roused up many a spirit. Those that hadn’t betrayed him raised their weapons as their morale hit a new high.“You shall not fight alone, chief! You have my blade!”
“And mine! I too shall offer my life to the cause!”
“We, your loyal warriors, will fight by your side!”Both groups disengaged and rallied to their leader. They faced off with their weapons drawn and their hostilities bared.“…I find it peculiar that you have chosen to remain ever loyal in a time such as this, but I see no fault in your decisions.” The chief took a moment to take a deep breath before breaking into a shout. “To me, men! Tonight, we march through hell’s gates! Let us fight to our last!”There was a big smile on his face, a reassuring, warrior-like grin.“C-chief!?” Nell questioned him with her eyes wide, but he ignored her and continued with his speech.
“Now go, men! Discipline your children and show them that they have misplaced their dignity!”A messy melee began the moment he finished his decree. Friend and foe became all but impossible to discern. And if that wasn’t bad enough, there came the matter of numbers. The number of foes that each warrior would have to slay was absurd. Still, the wingbearers did as true elites would and faced them without the slightest hint of fear. Their enthusiasm was domineering; their battlelust overwhelming, and their power unquestionable.The man in charge of the mysterious black-robed army clicked his tongue in annoyance before shouting at a nearby subordinate. “You there! Get rid of the humans!”
“That, I will not allow.”It was a meaningless order. His servant was cut down with a single blow before he could so much as get in range.“You must leave this place! If you truly wish to aid us, then take those amongst us who are unable to fight and go!”The hero hesitated for a moment. She didn’t want to abandon the chief or his warriors.“Nell!” The impatience that filled Ronia’s voice as she called for her brought Nell back to reality. She had to move.
“Okay…” she said with a hint of regret. “Let’s go. Stay alive, chief! Make sure this isn’t the last time we see each other!”
“Your concern is wasted. They would need another thousand men to defeat me,” laughed the chief. “Regillis! Orias! Take a few of our warriors and leave this place. Keep the women and children safe!”
“Orders received, sir.”
“Yes sir, I will uphold my duty, even if it costs me my life!”Reluctantly, Nell followed the chief’s orders and joined Regillis, Orias, and many others in retreating from the village-turned-battlefield.<– Prev — Next –>

Hero — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerNell was on guard. The pursuit she was subject to forced her to remain on edge at all times. The numerous enemy encounters she had engaged in were more sporadic than they were cohesive; the men in black only confronted her with one small unit at a time. Still, the chase was intense. The fiendish horde almost seemed endless. Countless foes had fallen to her blade, but reinforcements continued to flood out of the woodwork regardless.The men were silent. Though there had been many of them, not one had leaked their orders—not that they needed to. Their actions clearly suggested that they had been instructed to kill everyone that resisted them, details be damned. Nell and her companions had no choice but to keep moving—if they wanted to live, that is.“Nell!” Ronia raised her voice right as the hero finished dispatching another wave of enemies. “We need backup! Now!”The swordsman pursed her lips. They were in a bad spot. A really bad spot. She didn’t really want to acknowledge Ronia’s statement. Agreeing with her meant involving Yuki and, subsequently, exposing him to danger. That was the last thing she wanted. Even the thought of it plagued her with guilt. But she knew that it couldn’t be helped. They would have to reach a city in order to get any backup. And frankly, there weren’t any nearby. The fiends were sure to take them down before they made it.Yuki was the only one they were capable of contacting, the only person that she and the people traveling with her could rely on to provide them with the help they so desperately needed. Her reluctance didn’t stem from her knowledge of his strength. In fact, Nell knew that he would be able to overturn the near-hopeless situation at hand. She just didn’t want to be the reason that he was put in harm’s way. But she wasn’t the only person here. The hero knew that many a life was at stake.“…Yeah, I guess you’re right.” The hero silenced the part of her screaming in self-reproach and reluctantly acknowledged the mage’s demand. “We don’t really have any other choice. Use the orb.”Ronia reached into the pouch she had on her waist the moment her friend agreed to her pleas. But before she could grab the item in question, she was subject to a sudden assault. Her crisis detection skill allowed her to sense it. The taciturn mage knew that the enemies’ archers had unleashed a volley upon her.So she dodged.She pushed with as much force as her legs could muster and hit the deck. Ronia wasn’t a frontliner. She wasn’t very agile. Still, the mage managed to roll out of the way and avoid all bodily harm even in the face of her lack of physical strength. It was an action that everyone but her found commendable.Because the same couldn’t have been said for her equipment.Rather than hitting her, the arrow she so narrowly avoided drove its tip straight into her bag’s string. With nothing to hold it, the leather pouch fell straight to the ground.There was a crack, a loud crack.Ronia gasped in dismay as she swivelled around to retrieve the container and its contents.“Bore through my enemies! Sacred Arrow!” Ronia wasn’t the only one to turn. Nell did too. The hero created several projectiles made of light and sent them flying at the enemy archers.
“Follow her lead! Don’t let them get any closer!”Spurred on by the human, the wingbearers also raised their bows and began launching arrows, one after another, in an attempt to keep the enemy in check.Having her allies return fire provided the mage with just enough time to grab her pouch. She turned around the moment it was in her hands and retreated to safety while looking inside—an act that led her to grimace.“This is bad. They’re broken…” she muttered.
“Both of them!?” asked Nell.
“Yeah!” Ronia’s expression warped in panic. She clenched her teeth and began to tremble as she realized that everything had gone wrong. They had lost their only hope at survival. And it was all her fault.Like Ronia, Nell’s eyes widened. She too recognized the fact that they had just lost their contingency plan. A sense of hopelessness assailed her mind. But she drove it away. The hero knew that panic would serve no purpose on the battlefield, so she took a deep breath and forced herself to remain calm.Rather than overreacting, she redirected her energies towards racking her mind, towards finding a way out of the seemingly hopeless situation that they were stuck in. And, after a brief delay, she found it.“Can you fix them, Ronia?”
“…I think so,” said the mage. “I’ve been looking at their circuits and trying to understand them for days. I can definitely fix them. But I’ll need a few hours.”
“That’s great! Now keep running! We’ll figure something out later!”***“Wow! You’re so brave! Good job sitting through all of that. It must have hurt.” Mekina smiled at the child whose injuries she was taking care of before giving him a pat on the shoulder. “Okay, you’re all set! Next patient please!”After briefly glancing at the intelligence operative tasked with taking care of the wounded, Nell turned back towards the pair of warriors sitting before her. “How are things looking, Regillis?”“It appears that we are safe for the time being. Your Barrier of Illusion has thrown them off of our trail,” replied the wingbearer. “However, we must remain vigilant. There are far too many of them. It is only a matter of time before they discover us once more.”
“…And it doesn’t seem like they’ve got any intention of giving up,” sighed Nell.
“They do not wish for us to tell others of their underhandedness. There is much evidence to support the saying that demons obey the strong. However, it does not encompass the whole truth. We only obey those with might if they act in a manner deserving of our respect. The fiends know this. I do not know why they have suddenly begun acting so shamelessly,” said Regillis, in a grave tone. “Refusing to offer them our loyalty appears to have driven them out of their minds. They cannot allow us to live long enough to reveal their desperation. It would label them dishonourable. Their infamy would be accompanied by a severe loss of influence. I do not believe they will call off the pursuit.”Nell’s group was situated in an old ruin a bit away from the village. While they hadn’t managed to truly lose their pursuers, they had at least gotten them off their coattails for the time being. The most prominent nearby structure was a large statue. It looked as if it would have once been a towering, majestic sight to behold, but all the wear and tear it had been subject to had all but destroyed it. Making out its former appearance from what remained was impossible.Many a wingbearer rested at the statue’s feet, lying on their backs and sides to abate the overwhelming sense of exhaustion that assaulted them. The few that were up and about were handing out the little bits of food they happened to have on hand and helping the other members of their tribe.The scene almost made their temporary encampment appear like something along the lines of a makeshift military hospital. Those on the ground functioned as the patients while those on their feet played the part of caretakers. However, unlike a field hospital, the wingbearer camp was severely lacking in misery. That wasn’t to say the people were cheerful. Some wore foreboding frowns. Others clearly looked as if they had resolved themselves for death. But no one had given up hope. No man, woman, or child had fallen to despair; the wingbearers refused to conduct themselves in a manner not befitting a proud clan of warriors.It was this sort of behaviour that led Nell to understand exactly why they were regarded as such a powerful force in times of war. It all stemmed from their attitudes. Their calm and composed outlook had allowed them to earn many an achievement.“How far away did you say the nearest city was again?” asked Nell.
“I believe it is a two day march. It would not take nearly as long if we were to fly, but taking to the skies and revealing ourselves to the enemy would only lead to our demise,” said Orias.One of the largest problems faced by the wingbearers was the fact that they couldn’t make use of their greatest asset: their wings. Their inability to do so was a two-part problem. It was half because they would have trouble flying due to the lack of vision that accompanied the darkness, and half because it would allow the enemy to spot them with ease. They had no choice but to remain stuck to the ground. Like Nell and the other humans, they had conducted their escape with their feet.“They are sure to know that we wish to reach civilization. They have likely planned to ambush us immediately prior to our arrival,” said Orias.
“…I guess that means we have no choice but to hope Ronia comes through.”Nell glanced in her friend’s direction as she spoke. The mage was immersed in her task. No one else faulted her for dropping the orbs, but she felt a heavy sense of responsibility nonetheless. That was why she had devoted every last fibre of her being to fixing the red orb of correspondence. It was her way of owning up to her mistake and solving the problem that she had inadvertently caused.The intensity of her gaze and her lack of frustration seemed to indicate that all was going well, that she would be able to complete her repairs if given enough time. And that was the problem. Nell didn’t think that they could stall for long enough, at least not with the way things were. Ronia would never be able to truly focus on her work if she had to stay on the move. Conversely, sitting around would ultimately subject them to a heavy assault.Things were looking bad. Really bad.The hero knew that every hour she bought would improve everyone’s chances, that buying a day would all but guarantee everyone’s safety. Something had to be done.“…I do not wish to question your judgement,” said Regillis doubtfully. “But are you certain that calling for aid will better our chances? Did you not say that you have only a single individual willing to assist you?”
“It will,” said Nell. “I trust him enough to bet everything I have on him. I know he’s strong enough to pull through for us. In fact, he’s so much stronger than me that I can’t even tell how strong he is.”
“That is quite impressive. If you are willing to praise him to that extent, then I will trust you and expect the best.” said Regillis with his eyes wide. “I would have wished for the opportunity to cross blades with him and see his skills for myself were we not in such dire straits.”
“Indeed. I would very much love the opportunity to spar with him should we survive,” added Orias.The warriors’ comments led Nell to flash a wry smile. Both were still eagerly looking forward to challenging powerful foes despite the situation at hand.While Nell might have, to some extent, enjoyed it, the relatively peaceful atmosphere was not meant to last.“We’ve spotted a group of enemies to the southwest! They’ll reach us in about ten minutes!” A panicked warrior dashed into the camp as he gave his report.
“It appears that they do not wish to provide us even a moment of rest,” said Regillis, bitterly.
“Are there any other places we can use to take shelter nearby!?” shouted Nell.
“…” Regillis closed his eyes for a moment as he contemplated the question. “There is a valley half a day’s distance away. It is the perfect place for us to hide, but it will serve little purpose if they discover us before we reach it.”
“…Alright,” said Nell, after a deep breath.The hero stood up, looked in the direction of her enemies, and took a few quick steps forward.“Nell!?” Orias opened his eyes wide. “What are you—”
“Isolate! Barrier of Separation!”A massive wall suddenly materialized itself between Nell and the warriors, one created by the hero’s barrier-based unique skill. The towering, translucent structure went on as far as the eye could see. It was literally several kilometers long.“Nell!? Nell!”
“Do you wish to take them alone!? What is the meaning of this!”Both warriors immediately began hitting the barrier as they shouted in concern. But she didn’t pay their worries much mind.She knew that something had to be done. The status quo had to change. That was why she had to step up to the plate.It was the only way.“Take care of everyone, you two.”
“We cannot simply leave you to perish! It is not you, but we who are their targets!”
“If you want to help me, then protect Ronia,” she voiced a string of words resembling the ones that the chief of the wingbearers had said to her upon her departure. The phrase was accompanied by a smile, a stiff smile, but a smile nonetheless. “Make sure she’s safe enough to finish her repairs, okay?”
“Nell!”
“Nell!?”The next two to approach the wall and call for her were Ronia and Mekina.“If you don’t want me to die, then get out of here and finish those repairs, Ronia!”
“What are you talking about!? Stop being stupid and get rid of this bar—”
“Take care of Ronia for me, Mekina.” Nell ignored the mage’s protests and cut them off as she began speaking to her other companion. “And make sure you keep taking care of everyone that’s hurt too, okay?”
“…Of course, dear.” The older human agreed after a moment’s hesitation.
“Of course!? What do you mean, Mekina! Don’t just listen to her! Stop her!” Ronia’s screams were laced with panic and dread. But again, they were ignored.Though Nell was facing her friends, she could hear a series of footsteps coming from behind her. The enemy was closing in. Rapidly. “They’re here already! Just hurry up and go!”“We’re leaving, Ronia!” said Mekina.
“But that means—”
“No buts! If you really want to help her, then start running!”
“…Fine.”
“We haven’t achieved any of our objectives yet! Make sure you don’t abandon the mission, okay!?” Mekina craned her neck to give the brown-haired hero one last look as she took off.
“Don’t die, Nell! No matter what!” Likewise, the mage did the same as she broke into a sprint.
“Rest assured, Nell. You have our respect, and we will protect your friends even if it costs us our lives,” said Regillis.
“I hope that the tides of war will turn in your favour,” said Orias.Hearing everyone’s parting words caused Nell’s smile to relax and become more natural. She couldn’t help but find the frantic manner in which everyone else was acting a bit amusing.After watching them leave, she turned back towards the foes headed her way and drew her divine blade from its sheath. The holy weapon glowed. Durandal basked its surroundings with a pale light. And as she raised it in front of her, she closed her eyes and took another deep breath.She was ready. The barrier had consumed a massive amount of mana, but she still had about half of it remaining—not that she was all that dependant on her mana to begin with. Nell wasn’t a mage. She was a swordsman. She could continue to fight even if her magical reserves were drained dry.The footsteps grew clearer with every passing moment. There were dozens of foes coming her way. At least.Fear struck her. Her pulse quickened; her heart beat so hard and fast that she began to find it obnoxious. Her legs trembled. She felt like she was about to collapse.Not once did the thought of fighting for glory and honour cross her mind. Frankly, she wanted to turn tail and run as far away as she possibly could. But she couldn’t. She didn’t know why fate had played her the hand it did, but whatever the case, she had wound up a hero. The heroes that she had always looked up to, the literal legends whose tales were passed down by the bards and minstrels, never fled in the face of danger. They were known for functioning as living shields. Their power was always used for the sole purpose of protecting others. And they never failed. They would always cleave through the forces of evil and restore the world to its rightful, peaceful state. Even if it meant putting their own lives at risk.And it was her duty to do the same.She couldn’t run.She had to fight.Nell was severely lacking in experience. She barely qualified as a hero. And she definitely lacked the pride that came with the heroes of old; there were no major achievements to her name.Still, that didn’t change the fact that she was a hero.She couldn’t just sit by and let things be.So she made herself smile.The action was so forced that she could feel her mouth cramping up. But she kept the act up nonetheless.“This is as far as you go.” An intrepid grin appeared on her face as she readied herself to bathe her holy blade in blood.<– Prev — Next –>

Hero — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerSomewhere between thirty and forty men in black oozed out of the forest. They stood in a semi-circular pattern with their backs to the trees as they stared down the lone warrior that had stayed behind.“Is this barrier your doing?” The man who appeared to be the squad’s commander raised his voice.
“It is,” affirmed Nell. “It’s a barrier I put a lot of magic into, and it’s really hard to break. I’m sure you’d be able to make your way around it if you went far enough, but the others will all have escaped by the time you make it. If you want it out of your way, then you’re going to have to kill me.”“Well, if I must, then I suppose I will,” muttered the commander. His tone was so neutral it was disturbing; it dripped with nothing but indifference. “You heard the girl, men. Kill her.”Every single fiend kicked off the ground and broke into a dash.And so did Nell.She didn’t bother waiting for them to reach her.A battlecry erupted from the depths of her throat as she charged straight into enemy lines. She attacked the first man she noticed and tore her blade right through him as she passed him by; she didn’t even turn to look at the man whose life she had stolen.Her second target was the unit’s commander. One of her unique skills, Accelerate, kicked in as she boosted straight towards him and drove her weapon into his flank. Her attack contained all the speed and force of a cannonball. And yet, it somehow wasn’t fatal. The commander managed to twist his waist just far enough to avoid being slain.Backup came immediately. A wave of arrows began flying at Nell the moment she had finished swinging her blade. She had no choice but to defend or be pierced by the barrage.“Bore through my enemies! Sacred Arrow!”She bobbed and weaved to dodge every single incoming projectile before retaliating in kind and firing off several dozen arrows of light. Unlike her enemies’, Nell’s aim proved true. Several archers died where they stood, their bodies impaled by shimmering stakes of light.Daggers, armblades, and other armaments designed for the sake of assassination went on full display as the robed figures drew their weapons. Again, they all charged at her. And again, they failed.“Hide! Barrier of Concealment!”She created a veil even darker than the night itself and concealed herself from her foes.As seasoned killers themselves, the men in black knew that she had yet to leave the space. They didn’t know much about the barrier’s effects, but they understood that she was still within it. That was why they plunged their blades straight into the darkness without a moments’ hesitation.Only to hit nothing.It wasn’t as if they had guessed wrong. Their instincts were dead on. Nell was still within the barrier. She hadn’t phased out of their plane of existence or transported herself elsewhere. She had simply ducked.She bent her knees and dropped herself low enough to avoid all of their attacks before retaliating with a spinning slash aimed at each man’s torso. The sensation of her blade rending flesh travelled up her arms as her face was painted in a fresh coat of sanguine—not that it meant much of anything at all, in her eyes. Again, she didn’t so much as cast a glance at the men she slew. With all the power of her Accelerate skill at her back, she kicked off the ground and launched herself at the one man her eyes had been trained on ever since the battle’s inception: the enemy commander.The short-haired swordsman knew that taking his head was her only shot at victory. She was a powerful force. An undeniably powerful force. But they were many, and she was one. It simply wasn’t possible for her to thin out their numbers if they continued to coordinate. Her only shot at victory, the only thin sliver of a chance she had, was to mess up their chain of command and take advantage of the ensuing chaos.Alas, it was not meant to be. The commander had already seen her trick once and survived. It simply wasn’t going to work a second time. He raised his dagger and parried her blow perfectly despite the sudden burst of speed that accompanied it. Unfazed, she stepped forward to deliver a heavier, more convincing blow. But she couldn’t. The hero’s internal alarm suddenly began to blare, so she followed her gut and twisted her neck just in time to avoid an arrow that had come from right behind her.Her target didn’t miss the opening created by her sudden dodge. He managed to graze her shoulder with his dagger despite her best efforts to avoid the obvious, telegraphed strike. It was shallow. Very shallow, but it was still a wound nonetheless. Nell grimaced in pain and retreated as she quickly glanced in the direction that the projectile had come from.One of the men she had cut down had survived. He was on the ground and bleeding profusely. He was going to die. Period. But he was still a threat. He had the miniature crossbow affixed to his arm trained on her and he was sure to continue firing incessantly like the pest he was if she didn’t finish him off—not that she even had the chance to.“Keep your distance! Stay out of her range!”Her enemies immediately heeded their boss’ order. They backed off, drew their bows, and all fired upon her at once.Nell tried. She tried as hard as she could. She rolled, dodged, or cut down every incoming projectile she could. But there were too many. It simply wasn’t possible for her to block every single projectile. Several arrows pierced her armour and dug into her flesh.Pain shot through her nervous system.The agonized screech she let out almost immediately morphed into a battlecry; she knew she couldn’t show weakness, so she toughed out the pain and charged straight at the irritating archers assaulting her.Naturally, their immediate reaction was to begin backing off. But they couldn’t match her speed. They were doomed. She dashed into a group of them and delivered a series of fatal blows, each flowing perfectly into the next. Only when she was subject to yet another barrage of arrows did she finally stop attacking. She leapt out of the way, centered her blade, and got ready to fight with her back to the massive barrier behind her.“Is that all you’ve got?” she laughed. “You’re going to need a lot more men than that if you want to kill me!” Her enemies had formed a semi-circle around her, but Nell put on a daring smile regardless.
“Well… if you insist.”The commander’s reaction served as a cue. Enemy reinforcements began pouring out of the forest and taking their places around her. Their numbers were even greater than they had been at the encounter’s inception. So many men in black had gathered around her that she didn’t even want to begin trying to count them.“It’s too much of a risk to leave you be. You’re too dangerous, far more of a concern than the imbeciles we call the wingbearers. Threats like you have to be… eliminated,” said the commander in a cold, flat tone. His eyes were narrowed and his gaze was piercing. To Nell, it almost felt as if he was evaluating her very essence and seeing her potential. “This will be where you die.”His words led Nell to reflect on her actions. She had said far too much, and she was about to pay for it in blood. A wry smile appeared on her face. While she knew that her current circumstances were inevitable, she couldn’t help but feel as if she was in part responsible for them herself.***The battle had already lasted for hours. Literal hours. The night had long passed and the sun had long risen.Nell’s body felt as dull and heavy as lead. None of her limbs listened to her anymore. They wouldn’t move the way she wanted them to no matter how hard she pushed. Unlike her opponents, who could take turns attacking in waves, she hadn’t had a moment to rest or refuel. She was so hungry that her eyes felt like they were spinning, and her throat was so dry she could feel her skin cracking as she breathed.To make matters worse, she had lost a lot of blood. Too much. Her stamina slowly drained away as her vital fluids oozed from the multitude of scratches that covered her body. The arrows embedded in her shoulder and flank didn’t do much to help the situation either.Her mana stores had long reached the bottom of the barrel. She only managed to cast the occasional spell because Durandal happened to have its own store of it. As much as she wished otherwise, she knew it wouldn’t last. Her holy blade would soon run dry, and there was nothing she could do about it.Needless to say, her barrier had vanished with the last bit of her magic. That was why she had switched to retreating through the forest as she fought. Fortunately, the enemy had chosen to prioritize her over those she had helped escape. The commander had chosen to dedicate all of his resources to relentlessly chasing her down after coming to the conclusion that she was the larger long-term threat.Technically speaking, Nell had succeeded. Her friends and the refugees they accompanied were hours away from the men in black. All because of her efforts. That said, it wasn’t as if things were really looking all that good for her. The fiends had her driven into a corner. Frankly put, she was screwed.They had seen all of her tactics. She had crawled through the underbrush, waded through mud, and thrown off her enemies with barriers of concealment and barriers of illusion. And in exhausting her kit, she came to realize that her enemies were specialists. The proficiency with which they tracked her seemed to indicate that they possessed skills capable of aiding them in their pursuit. She couldn’t escape. It didn’t matter what she did. They would always find her, engage her in a skirmish, and eat away at the tiny bit of stamina she had left. She knew she couldn’t hold out for much longer. Her body had hit its limit.Nell had long lost track of the number of times she had swung her sword. She didn’t know how many men she had killed, nor did she remember the amount of time she had bought—not that it mattered. Knowing the metrics associated with her plight wouldn’t have changed anything. The same couldn’t have been said for knowing the terrain, however.Because the hero soon found herself staring down a grassy plain.The trees that she had used to keep herself hidden from her enemies were gone from her field of view. She had reached the edge of the forest. The long game of cat and mouse she had been engaged in had come to an end.“You’ve certainly wasted quite a good bit of my time.”Spinning around, Nell found herself staring down the enemy commander, the man who had ordered his underlings to chase her to the point of creating trauma. She took up a stance with her blade as soon as she saw him, but she was too late. One of the men in black slugged her in the gut before she could truly ready the weapon.It was a solid hit, one that hurt so bad she felt her consciousness grow hazy. Before she could recover, she was hit again. A second man ran up to her while she was still bent over and kicked her holy sword right out of her hand. Under normal circumstances, she never would have let such a thing happen, but she simply didn’t have the strength or stamina to keep a good grip on her sword when she was as exhausted as she was.Rather than finishing her with his blade, the fiend followed up his attack by grabbing her now empty hands and violently pulling them behind her. He then kicked her in the back of her knees and forced them to buckle before presenting her to his commander.“Let me guess…” Nell said between heavy pants. If looks could kill, hers would have finished off the enemy’s leader in an instant. “You’re going to beat me up… and make me look as miserable as you can… before killing me in front of my companions… Just to make an example out of me.”
“Well, we certainly will hurt you. You’ve given us quite a lot of trouble, so I’d say that it’s only fair. As for killing you? I happen to have other plans,” said the commander. “Chasing you around for as long as I have has given me a bit of a… change of heart. You see, I happen to like women like you.”
“Well, I hate men like you,” said Nell.The man didn’t mind the fact that Nell had spat an insult at him. In fact, her act of defiance led him to squat down in front of her with the lewdest of grins plastered all over his face.“Yes, yes, that’s exactly it! That unwavering attitude! That unbreakable resolve!” he said, ecstatically. “I can’t wait to take you back to my manor and… reeducate you. You can fight back all you want. It won’t change a thing. I’ll drill my teachings into your body. And soon, soon, I’ll break you in. You’ll be shaking those hips of yours and begging me for what I want before you know it.”A series of chills ran down Nell’s spine as the man tenderly stroked her cheek with his fingers. She felt as if she was being caressed by an insect; his fingers were more feelers than they were digits. Driven by a sense of absolute revulsion, she glared at him with renewed vigour.“Besides, you’ve killed quite a number of my men. I can see that you’re quite the fighter. Throwing all that talent away would be nothing short of wasteful, don’t you think?” he asked. “Well, what do you say? Spread your legs and wag your tail for me, and I’ll let you live a life of ecstasy.”The commander grabbed Nell’s jaw and slowly raised it such that she was looking right into his eyes. Almost as if by reflex, she opened her mouth to scream in refusal, but she stopped right before she did. She swallowed her words, silenced her emotions, and began speaking in a steady, neutral tone.“If I say yes… will you let my friends go free?”
“Why, of course I would.” The man flashed a conman’s smile before continuing in a tone that screamed he was lying at the top of his lungs. “I don’t care what happens to them anymore. You’re all that matters. Say yes, and I’ll let them go free.”
“I see…”The hero twisted her lips into a frown, as if to express that she was in the midst of contemplation. She let the stiffness leave her muscles in order to express that she was no longer thinking of resisting.Naturally, the man standing behind her also loosened up; he relaxed the grip he had on her arms.He fell for the act. Everyone fell for the act.The moment the fiends lowered their guards was the moment she acted. She wrenched her arms free and drew the blade hanging from her waist. Her first target was the commander. Her blade tore right through the hand he had on her chin and cut his wrist clean off.Next, she attacked the person that had been responsible for holding her down. She cut off both his arms before mustering up just enough strength to leap away. The weapon she had in her right hand was not Durandal. It was Lunar Blossom, her side arm. The dagger he had given her. She had carried it on her person ever since it was first gifted to her. Back then, Nell had known little to nothing about daggers and their usage. Now, however, things were different. She had put herself through an extensive amount of training in order to ensure that she was worthy of the blade. The hero had not only acquired the dagger mastery skill, but also raised it all the way to its third level in the span of roughly a month.Her proficiency could be seen through her stance. The reverse grip she held her blade in brimmed with confidence.“I refuse! I’d rather fight to my last breath than join the likes of you!” The commander had promised that he wouldn’t hunt down her companions, but she knew not to trust him. The chance of him following through on the agreement was less than that of a monkey with a pen accidentally reproducing a famous piece of literatureShe had only momentarily played along with his ruse in order to buy just one extra moment in hopes that it would raise her allies’ chances.“Fine! Then lament your choices as you die!” shouted the commander. “Men, capture her! Do whatever it takes! Don’t let her escape, and don’t let her off with an easy death! Make her feel pain, suffering, and humiliation! Carve the meaning of disgrace into her body as you drain her blood and turn her into a lifeless corpse!”A sense of impending doom assaulted Nell as she watched the man bark out orders while nursing his wrist. Chances were, she was going to die. She had been on the verge of death for quite some time, but now, it was finally going to really happen. It was a discouraging thought. But Nell didn’t give up. She was more than willing to offer herself up and fight to the death if her sacrifice brought her friends safe passage.The brown-haired swordsman had never amounted to much of a hero. She was just an ordinary girl that happened to have been shoved into the role, and she lacked the experience necessary to perform it. Still, she was satisfied. Because her last act would finally make her worthy of her title.While it was unfortunate that she never did get to see Yuki again, she knew that he would be able to take her place. That he would protect everyone in her stead. That, unlike her, he would unconditionally succeed.He always seemed nonchalant, unconcerned with the events happening around him. Even so, he would always invest his energies into helping those that needed it. He would reach out to those that needed it most and startle them with aid that they had never expected.Thinking of him, remembering him, brought a smile to her face.Her enemies were drawing closer. Looking around prompted a mix of emotions to swell within her.Fear.Anguish.Anxiety.Concern.Rage.Sorrow.And the indomitable desire to crush her foes.Again, they drew closer.So Nell roared. She bellowed at the top of her lungs to express all of the emotions raging within her as she readied herself for her final confrontation.A confrontation that would never happen.Something approached from the air. It cut through the air at an incredible speed and caused the earth to tremble as it descended upon the grassy plain. There was a powerful shockwave; the force of its high speed landing kicked up a massive cloud of dust. Reflexively, she brought up her arms to shield her face from it.Likewise, the men approaching her had also defended their eyes from the dust. But they had failed to resist the shockwave. The force of the impact had sent them tumbling through the air.Looking through the gaps in her arms, she noticed a humanoid silhouette within the dust cloud.“Hey Nell. What’s up?” She was greeted by a familiar voice. One that she had eagerly looked forward to hearing. One belonging to the man that had occupied her thoughts on her deathbed.As the dust cleared, her eyes confirmed what her ears had told her.He had finally come for her.“Geez. You’re so late!” Her eyes dampened, and her lips warped into a bit of a pout as she complained at him in a voice filled with heartfelt emotion.<– Prev — Next –>

Wrath
Editors: Sebas Tian, Joker, SpeedphoenixWhew. Oh man, that was close. Looks like I made it just in time.“Wow, you sure as hell look like you’ve been put through the wringer. You sure you’re really cut out for this hero business?”
“O-oh shut up!” sulked Nell. “I tried my best… What more do you want…?”The hero was in a terrible state. Her breathing was ragged; her shoulders heaved each time she spoke. Her clothes were a complete mess. They were torn all over and covered in bodily fluids. Mud could be seen plastered all over her body. And she even had a couple arrows stuck in her. One was in her shoulder. The other had dug its way into the side of her stomach. A single glance was enough for me to understand that she had found herself wrapped up in one hell of a struggle. Analyzing her proved that exact point. Her health was in the double digits, and her mana had been drained to a sliver. I had to squint to see the literal pixel she had left.My match against the old butler was the last one I had scheduled for the day, so I was able to sneak out and fly off without any further hassle. My flight was, of course, accompanied by heavy use of the Ennegine. Kind of. Enne herself was more or less out of mana, so I ended up having to take full control of both parts of the process. Ughhh, that was such a pain. I almost crashed like a million times…Even with my struggles accounted for, reaching the orb that served as my beacon and destination ended up taking less than an hour. Enne and I weren’t able to do anything as fancy as breaking the sound barrier just yet, but we were still ridiculously fast nonetheless.I had expected to see Nell upon arrival, but turns out, she wasn’t there. Instead, I found myself standing amongst a group of miserable looking men and women. The first thing that had come to mind as I saw them was that they were probably refugees. Their lack of luggage had made it seem as if they had just escaped from a warzone or some other kind of disaster. The group was mostly made up of “wingbearers,” a type of demon that looked more or less like a bipedal bird.One of the two humans amongst the group had ran straight at me as I landed. While it wasn’t the girl I was looking for, it was at least one that I recognized. She hadn’t bothered with any sort of formality. Nell’s mage friend had immediately opted to start begging me for help. Wow uh, wow. Wait, isn’t she the quiet type? Shit must be real bad if she’s acting like this.Her panic had proved infectious. I ended up finding myself feeling a sense of urgency as I rushed in the direction she had pointed me in. All I had to do to reach Nell from there was literally follow my map. She showed up on it once I got close enough, and it turned out that the situation was just about as bad as I had expected. She was surrounded by enemies dressed from head to toe in black. They were fiends, and I too had dealt with their operatives on several occasions. And that was where I made my entrance.Despite supposedly being a part of some sort of highly trained special forces, the fiends were idiots. They didn’t know how to account for sudden, unexpected changes. My advent left them too stupefied to act. In fact, they were so slow to adapt that they ended up remaining completely still as I continued to engage her in conversation.Nell began to wobble after speaking a few lines of her own. All the tension had left her body, and with it, so did all her remaining strength. She collapsed, falling forwards as she did.“Woah! Careful there,” I said as I caught her in my arms. “Man, they got you good. You really should’ve called me sooner.”
“Sorry,” she said, guiltily. “You see, uhm… The truth is… I think we might have… accidentally broken both the orbs… you gave us…”
“Wait. What? Then how’d you call me?”
“Ronia probably… fixed one of them… She’s really good at that kinda stuff…”Ronia… Ronia… Who was Ronia again? Oh! She must be talking about that mage chick. Wait. She FIXED one? Holy shit. Talk about smart.“W-who the hell ar—”
“Shut up. I wasn’t talking to you.”One of the dimwitted retards finally finished processing the fact that a new challenger had appeared on the battlefield. He raised his voice and tried to question me. Frankly, I didn’t really care what he wanted, so I cut him off with a glare. He clearly wasn’t smart enough to take a hint, so I crafted a barrier made up of jet streams in order to prevent any further interruptions.“I can fix you up, but we’ll probably need to get rid of these arrows first. It’ll probably hurt, but you’re just going to have to grit your teeth and bear with it,” I said.The high grade potions I had were worthy of being called elixirs given their potency, but they weren’t exactly all mighty. Her wounds would heal, sure, but they would heal around anything that was embedded within her, which meant that we would have to pull out any foreign objects in her body before restoring it.“Okay,” she said.With her consent out of the way, I looked at the two projectiles still stuck inside of her. They were arrows, which meant I couldn’t rely solely on brute force to get them out else risk getting them stuck. That said, they weren’t all that deep. They were still shallow enough for me to see the arrowheads poking out of her flesh. We probably wouldn’t have to push them through.I laid her on the ground, snapped the ends off the first wooden bolt, and grabbed its shaft. “Alright, here goes.”After a quick word of warning, I yanked the whole thing out in one swift motion. Blood started spurting out of the wound. Some of it ended up splashing onto my face, or rather, the mask that covered it.“Ow…” she grimaced a bit, but laughed it off right after. Though she was covered in a cold sweat, her smile stayed firm. “Wait… you’re wearing a mask again…? And you’ve even changed… your hair colour this time… It looks a lot like Lefi’s…”
“Yeah, totally badass, right? Lemme know if you want one. I’ve got a couple spares lying around.”
“You know what…? I think… I’d like one.”
“Woah, someone’s had a change of heart. I could’ve sworn you said you didn’t want one back when we were in the capital,” I said as I pulled out the arrow in her torso.
“Ouch…!” she groaned. “I know I did… but I think the whole mask idea is… growing on me now… I’m starting to think…. they’re kinda cool after all… after getting a few more looks at them…”
“Well, well, well, would you look at that? Silly old Nell’s finally grown to understand the beauty of masks,” I said with a smirk. “One mask coming right up.”I reached into my inventory and grabbed both a mask and a potion. I placed the first of the two items on top of her before reaching for her head and propping her up.“Here you are. Oh, and I figured I might as well give you a potion while I’m at it. Make sure you down the whole thing, but take it nice and slow. Don’t spill any, alright?” With that said, I brought the potion to her lips and slowly poured it in.The item’s effects were immediate. Her wounds started vanishing in the blink of an eye. A few seconds was all it took for her to be restored. The cuts that covered her body vanished as her skin reverted to its usual soft, supple state. Only after watching her health bar fill back up did I finally breathe a sigh of relief.“Alright. You should be good now.”
“Okay… Then I’ll… just jump right back into the fray…”
“Yeah, how about no. I mean sure, potions heal you right back up, but they don’t do jack for all the stamina you’ve lost,” I flicked Nell on the forehead as I spoke. “You’ve done plenty already. Just close your eyes, kick back, and chill. I got this. Don’t worry about these assholes. And don’t worry about your friends either. I’ve got it all under control.” I shrugged and spoke in my usual tone. I made sure to make it sound like I was doing the usual and just dicking around in order to make it easier for her to relax.
“Mmk… Thanks Yuki… I… love… y…” She was so tired that she ended up passing out mid-sentence. Her eyes closed, her breathing slowed, and her body relaxed as she drifted off to dreamland. Wew. She must be tired as fuck.I opened up my inventory again and reached inside to grab a necklace, one embedded with a spell that would allow its wearer to warp to the dungeon. It was the one I had kept on hand in case of an emergency. I wrapped it around her neck, channeled my mana through it, and activated the magical circuit embedded within. Her body slowly began to fade. She turned translucent before eventually vanishing altogether. She’s probably going to be confused as all hell when she wakes up in the true throne room. There’s a chance she might not be all that happy about it either seeing as how it might mess with her agenda and whatnot. Oh well, not my problem. Besides, she probably needs herself a vacation after everything she’s been through anyway, so it’s not like there’s even going to be any real harm done, even if I do screw up her plans.“Sorry Enne, you mind kicking back and chilling inside my inventory for a bit?”
“Okay.” The sword girl had a pretty good idea of what I was up to. Despite her aversion to being kept in storage, she immediately did the telepathic equivalent of nodding without much at all in the way of hesitation. Thanks Enne. You’re a real good kid, you know that?After putting her away, I got up off the ground, took a deep breath, and swept one of my hands to the side as I dispelled the water-based barrier that had separated Nell and I from the fiends that had been attacking her.Raising my gaze, I found them with their weapons drawn and their guards up.“How dare you get in our way!” The man I presumed to be the asshole in charge began shouting at me the moment I looked in his direction. “Now talk! Who the hell are you, and where did you hide the girl!?”I really didn’t feel like putting up with his shit, so I didn’t bother answering him. At least not with words. Rather than being civilized, I ran up to him, grabbed his face, and began squeezing his head without a word. I didn’t hold back, so my hands acted the part of a vise and began bending his skull out of shape.Of course, the action led him to scream in pain. He was loud, too loud. I couldn’t find his shrieks, yowls, and squawks as anything but obnoxious. Maybe I should rip out his tongue. Oh, what about just squishing his head and make his brain explode? Might as well. Bastard totally deserves it.Unfortunately, one of his subordinates came to bail him out while I was in the middle of contemplating my options. The man had a dagger, and I didn’t feel like getting stabbed, so I twisted my body to evade it before countering by whipping the shitbag whose head I’d deformed right at his buddy. A loud thud accompanied the impact as the two crashed into each other.Apparently, the rest of the idiots had finally realized they were under attack, as they raised their bows and began shooting wave after wave of arrows at me. There were so many that I suspected I would end up looking like something along the lines of a porcupine if I let them hit. Of course, it went without saying that I didn’t. I instantly conjured a barrier made out of wind and repelled every single projectile aimed in my direction. Some of the arrows had been enchanted with magic in order to raise their potency, but it didn’t matter. None could overpower my defenses. They simply weren’t threatening. They were so much weaker than me that I felt as if they couldn’t even be thought of as a threat.Naturally, I wasn’t the only one to realize the difference in power between the fiends and I. My opponents did too. Unrest ran rampant amongst their ranks as they realized that I had effortlessly negated all of their attacks—not that I cared. My mind was focused on other things. Namely, irritation.I was pissed. I couldn’t help but feel waves of anger surge within me. An irresistible urge to destroy everything leaked from every single pore in my body. I was seething with so much rage that it threatened to swallow my mind whole. It was stirring up my body and urging it to action. I was just as mad as I had been back when I’d realized that some dumbfuck had decided to kidnap my little sister. Apparently, I liked the hero a lot more than I’d thought I did.Of course, I knew that I was being unreasonable, that I was more or less throwing a tantrum, and that murdering everyone and breaking everything wasn’t going to undo what had been done. But I didn’t care.You know, I always have been a self-centred, egotistical, piece of shit. I’ve always had a habit of acting like the world revolves around me. Not that it doesn’t, as far as I’m concerned.Shit, I mean, it’s not even my fault I’m selfish. It’s because other people are fucking assholes. Look, just listen to me. Once you get out there in the world, you really start to understand that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Goodwill doesn’t exist. People are all two-faced as shit. Everyone and their mother’s got a god damned secret agenda.Honestly, charity is the height of autism. White knight philantropist fuckbois can go eat shit for all I care. And yes, I know that some people seem like they’re “genuinely kind.” Some even get labelled as literal saints and shit. But as far as I’m concerned, they’re all creepy as balls. They’ve gotta be hiding something. Or fucking deranged. Either way, they can go fuck themselves.There’s no point not living life like you’re the center of the universe. You do what you want because it’s for you. The point of life is to satisfy yourself and your own fucking ego. That’s why I decided to live with everyone. And that’s why I decided to tie the knot with Lefi. It was all for me. And only me. Because I’m a self-centred piece of shit.It’s precisely ‘cause I’m so selfish that I don’t want to see the people around me, the people I think of as a part of *my* world, get hurt. I don’t really know when I started thinking of Nell that way, but whatever. Apparently, I fucking do, and that’s what fucking matters.In a sense, one could say that I really did act in a manner befitting a demon lord. I literally forced things to bend to my will no matter how unreasonable said will was.“I’m going to kill every last one of you,” I glared at the men around me as I hissed at them. “But before I do, I’m going to have you do me a favour and suffer. Because fuck you. All of you.”I pulled a dagger out of my inventory, filled its magic circuit with a near excessive amount of mana, and turned towards the man I had thrown. He was a bit of a funny sight to behold. He was ordering everyone to kill me, shouting at the top of his lungs in a fit of rage. After chucking the weapon at his feet, I immediately flapped my wings and took off. I made sure to gain a good bit of distance before turning to check whether or not the dagger had ended up getting stuck in the ground.It wasn’t like I was being careless. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Unlike the fiends, who knew nothing of what I had done, I had merely taken a necessary step in order to ensure my own safety.Thinking that I had opted to run as opposed to fight, they began shouting angrily. Or at least they tried. Their rage was soon replaced by suffering, suffering I had injected straight into their worthless brains.“W-What’s going on!? What the hell!? Oh god! Oh god, no! No! No!!”
“It hurts! It hurts! My arms! My legs! The blood! It hurts! Stop it, stop it! Please, stop it! Stop pumping blood! Stop beating!”
“Why!? Why are they staring at me! My eyes! They won’t stop staring at me! They won’t go away!”At first, it only affected those near the dagger. Their companions regarded them with looks of confusion, but they too soon came to understand. Because, soon, they too found themselves sucked into my spell. Incoherent screaming spread through the crowd. Its members grew terrified of spectres that never existed. Some writhed around on the ground and flailed their limbs like madmen. Others clawed away at their own chests and dug out their own hearts. Yet another group stuck their fingers into their eye sockets and gouged out their own oculi.They shrieked in agony and howled for release, but those that had failed to die only continued to suffer. There was no release. Not for them.The dagger I had thrown was one made of mythril, one engraved with the spell that Enchant had unlocked upon reaching its final level: Nightmare. Nightmare was a brutal, inhumane spell that would engulf a large area and destroy the minds of those that lay within with a series of horrifying, soul-consuming hallucinations.Hellscape was the only term that could even begin to describe the scenes they were shown, and not even that was enough to encompass the full extent of the dread that I had inflicted upon them. It was only natural. Nightmare had come hand in hand with a level ten skill. Level ten skills were so powerful that they could only be described as god-like in nature; the power they represented could no longer be thought of as that of mere mortals. Of course, such an abstract description was unnecessary in the face of the results it wrought.The most terrifying part about Nightmare was that it would feed off of the person it was affecting. It would fuel itself with their magical energies and force the illusions it created to persist until they were drained dry. And it did it slowly. The spell made sure its targets suffer for what seemed like an eternity. Those that bore through it without killing themselves would often wind up brain dead. They became invalid vegetables incapable of function. That said, it wasn’t as if it was impossible to remain sane even in the face of the spell’s horrors. Some were able to endure without losing themselves to the madness. But without mana, there was little that they could do. As far as combat was concerned, they were just as crippled as every other unfortunate survivor.While it was about as effective as effective could get, Nightmare wasn’t without its downsides. Mythril was literally the worst metal that anything enchanted with Nightmare could be made out of, and it only barely managed to make the threshold because it happened to be especially magically conductive. No inferior metal could stand the sheer amount of magical energy required to activate the circuit. Anything worse than mythril would literally melt. That said, it wasn’t as if mythril itself was that much better off. A single use of Nightmare was enough to destroy the mythril blade that functioned as its catalyst. It was possible to milk a few extra casts of the spell out of something made up of a rarer material, but it wasn’t worth it. The weapon would eventually end up turning into a pile of mush anyway. And since the price of metal grew exponentially in relation to how precious it was, mythril weapons actually ended up having the best cost/cast ratio.All in all, casting the spell was ridiculously expensive. I only had a few Nightmare-infused daggers on hand, and I considered them one of my trump cards. Honestly, using one here was a waste. Oh well, totally worth it. Fuck these shitheads.After spending a good chunk of time loitering around in midair and watching just about everyone suffer, I realized that the spell had begun wearing off. Most of the retards affected had already died. The few that hadn’t lay sprawled on the ground with all sorts of bodily fluids covering them and their surroundings. Once they realized that they could finally move again, they promptly raised their weapons and slit their own throats, one after another. Only one of them had survived my house of horrors and retained the will to live. Unlike the others, he was slowly crawling away, desperately trying his best to escape.I recognized him. He was the first to react to my arrival, the dumbfuck that had barked commands and bitched at everyone else. Huh. Wow, turns out he’s got balls. Here I was thinking he was some sorta pussy. Well, works for me. Hell, this is perfect. I’ve been looking for a few answers anyway. Might as well have him “cooperate” before I finish him.After looking at the dagger and confirming that it had turned into a puddle of junk, I decided to let gravity take control. I plummeted back towards the earth and landed right in front of him. The action dashed his hopes; he squealed like a piglet the moment he saw me.His response led me to grin. I knew that the smirk on my face was a sinister one. In fact, I was willing to bet that, if there had been a third party watching over the situation, they would have thought of me as malice incarnate. “Hey, asshole, y’miss me? I heard you were heading out for a bit. Mind if I tag along?”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Sorry for the absence, but y’know, life gets in the way sometimes. I’m running 3 different DnD campaigns, taking part in a fourth, working full time, taking care of the housework I need to take care of, and trying to complete a shitton of games while barely leaving enough time for about 6 hours of sleep. It gets rough, and my motivation for this segment kind of faded away over time. Hopefully, I’ll try and get back into the swing of things now that we got a set schedule. I guess you can call this Season 2 of Joker’s Corner? We’ll see. I’m sure all of my fans missed me, so I’m actually kind of happy to get this going again. Remember, if you have any questions for me, just leave them below with the hashtag #AskJoker. Nirvash isn’t around right now, she’s off doing her own thing. Who knows? Maybe a certain subset of you will see her soon? See y’all in the next chapter!<– Prev — Next –>

Confrontation — Part 1
Editors: Joker, Speedphoenix, Sebas Tian“Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready!? The first long awaited semi-final match is about to begin!” The master of ceremonies’ statements led the crowd to go wild. Their zealous cheers were filled with a fiery fervor. “In one corner, we have this year’s most arrogant man, a fearless fighter who’s shown us that his insults are backed by pure power! Ypsiloooooonnn!”Although the crowd was roaring, I remained silent. Not a word left my mouth as I made my way centre stage.“And in the other corner, we have a man with limbs as elastic as rubber, a man capable of attacking from every direction without even the slightest warning, a man that has clawed his way through to the semi-finals with nothing but trickery and deception! I give you… Mejaaaaaaaaaaaagrrryyyyy!”Opposite me entered a man with limbs I could only label absurd. His legs were as long as the Nile, but not even they stood out as much as his arms. They were just that bizarre. He had an extra elbow where his wrist was supposed to be, and it looked like it was probably double-jointed. The fact that half his face was shrouded by a veil made out of linen only contributed to his creepiness.I knew who he was, but not because I had ever met or seen him. The only reason I recognized him was because the king had described his features to me in detail ahead of time; he was one of the contestants that I was supposed to be wary of.“What the hell did you do?” He greeted me with an oddly high pitched giggle. “I got asked to do someone a favour and kick your ass. And it was a formal request too.” I stayed silent. I didn’t bother answering him. It didn’t take long for him to realize, so he ended up sighing and shrugging in disappointment. “You’re really ruining the fun for me, you know that? Oh well, whatever. I was planning to kick your ass either way!”
“Let the match… begin!”The moment the gong rang was the moment I moved. I kicked off with all the force I could muster and swung Enne, who was still sheathed, at his face.My movements were so fast that he probably thought I had teleported. Adding to that effect was the lack of precedence. I had never done anything even remotely close to charging in right off the bat. The combination of my speed and his lack of readiness threw him off. That said, daddy long legs hadn’t made it all the way to the semis because he was lucky. He proved that he was more than just a weakling by getting his shit together and throwing up a quick guard.His reaction came late, so his guard ended up being more committed than it otherwise would have been. As such, he wasn’t able to do anything about me lowering my blade and intentionally throwing off its trajectory in order to exploit a hole in his defense.Enne’s sheath drilled itself into his still-open torso and sent him flying into a wall outside the arena’s bounds. And that was it. He was unconscious. His body slid to the ground as his mind was shrouded in darkness.“T-The battle is over! The winner is Ypsilooooooooooon!” The crowd went wild as the master of ceremonies announced my victory. They seemed to find my display exciting despite the fact that the battle had only lasted for an instant.On a normal day, I would have turned around and made my way off stage. But today wasn’t a normal day. I had long decided that I was going to stay right where I was even after I finished beating my opponent. Because frankly, I wasn’t here for him to begin with. I simply didn’t have the time to waste on him or any other punk.That was why I ignored both the crowd and the tournament’s staff. I grabbed the sword that daddy long legs never drew, reeled back, and launched it like a javelin. Its blade rattled as it spun through the air. But its course stayed true. It continued to fly straight towards the cocky douchewad that the fiends called their chief.Both the emcee and the audience gasped in surprise, but carrot top didn’t. He remained calm as he shifted his head to the side and avoided the attack. In fact, he didn’t break posture. He kept his face propped up with a fist all the way through.The way the blade impaled the fancy looking chair he was sitting in proved that the attack would have been fatal had it landed.That was why the audience froze. Their eyes were stuck to me like glue. But I ignored them. I continued to focus my gaze on the asshole I was after as I balled my hand into a fist with my thumb sticking out, turned it upside down, and lowered it.It was a challenge, a series of actions that could not have possibly been interpreted as anything else. I was telling him to get his ass into the arena so I could whoop it.Even I knew that my actions were unforgivable. In my last life, they would have led to a swift and immediate arrest. And while this world wasn’t the world that I was born in, its ruleset wasn’t all that different. I wouldn’t have been surprised to discover that the fiends already had a guillotine with my name on it. If they were human.This, however, was the demon realm, where might made right. Rather than condemning my crimes, the demons welcomed them.“What pride! What hubris! Can you believe this man!? Of all people to challenge, Ypsilon has challenged Lord Gojim to a fight! What bravery! It appears that he truly knows no fear, ladies and gentlemen!” The emcee started screaming excitedly. And the crowd followed suit.“Gojim! Gojim! Gojim! Gojim!”They began chanting fuckface’s name over and over again. It was only a few people at first, but their hype spread like a plague and soon infected the entire audience. I was well aware that they just wanted to see their boss kick the shit out of the cocky, disrespectful insurgent that had challenged him. They wanted him to turn me into a bloody corpse. But that was fine.Because it meant that they wanted the fight to happen. That was what mattered.Carrot top couldn’t back out. Not when this many people were urging him to take me down. Refusing to get on stage would only make him seem like a pathetic weakling. And even if it didn’t, the blackhearted schemer I had as my ally would make sure that it ended up that way. I knew for a fact that he would be more than happy to publicly shame and defame his political rival. If he backed down, then rumours of his cowardice were sure to spread throughout the demon realm like wildfire.His only other choice was to do as I wished and fight me like a man. Come on dude, hurry up already, goddammit. Get the fuck down here so I can tear out your fucking spine!***“Gojim! Gojim! Gojim! Gojim!”
“Idiots, the lot of them.” Gojim, the chief of the fiends, scoffed as the demon realm’s people called his name.
“You must not accept, chief! I have no idea what he is plotting, but there is no sense in needlessly putting yourself in harm’s way!”
“I know,” snorted the chief. He pulled the sword from his seat without rising to his feet and chucked it back into the arena.Gojim was well aware that the man that had challenged him was dangerous. The way he fought had proven that he was amongst the mightiest of warriors. Even though he had been doing his best to hold back. Never once had the mysterious masked entity gone all out. He had almost seemed to treat the tournament like a game. He was fighting for sport and doing his utmost to use as little strength as possible in order to avoid killing the other contestants. There was no doubt in Gojim’s mind that he would be many, many times stronger in a real fight, a duel to the death with no holds barred. Because the reports he had received from his subordinates had already confirmed it as fact.“Wow, Gojim. Planning on running away already?” said Phynar. The king had a huge grin on his face. He wasn’t even trying to hide it.
“Is this another one of your silly schemes?”
“Not this time, no. I’m just about as surprised as you are.” The king laughed. “He sure is an interesting one, isn’t he?”Like Gojim, Phynar had been more or less blindsided by Yuki’s sudden declaration. That said, it wasn’t as if he had been caught completely off guard. His men had long informed him that Yuki had been seething with rage ever since he had returned from wherever he had gone during the day. The king hadn’t seen the extent of Yuki’s bloodlust for himself, but he had more or less determined that the mercenary he had hired would end up doing something. That said, he still wished that he would have been informed of Yuki’s decision ahead of time. It would have allowed him to devise a more concrete plan of action. Still, it wasn’t as if he was losing anything. Phynar was sure to gain from the scenario that had unfolded regardless; another card had been added to his hand.“Well, you’re free to run away with your tail tucked between your legs if you’d like,” said the king. “I’m sure a pampered, sheltered princess like you would hate getting hurt, huh?”
“Hah! You think that I would run from a challenge? Nonsense!”
“C-Chief, please do not engage in this act of foolishness!”His aide’s call fell on deaf ears; Gojim had fallen for the taunt. He got to his feet, shook off the man that was desperately trying to stop him, and leapt onto the stage.<– Prev — Next –>

Confrontation — Part 2
Editors: SpeedphoenixMy eyes narrowed as I watched Carrot Top leap from his seat. Oh, thank god. He’s actually manning up and getting his fucking ass down here.We stared each other down. His landing was accompanied by a brief moment of silence—one that was interrupted by an explosion. The blast was violent. Dust, smoke, and floor scattered into the air. So powerful was the magical landmine, the trap I had set for him, that the audience felt the urge to scream. And yet, much to my annoyance, he survived.“Your petty tricks will not affect me.” The soulless ginger spoke in a haughty, self-important tone, one that made me want to slug him as hard as I could.I had at least wanted to hurt him, even if it was just a bit. But as the debris cleared, it revealed that my attack had done literally nothing besides cover him in dust. Yeah, I figured. I’ve already shown him that one, so he probably saw it coming a mile away.“Petty tricks? What are you, retarded? Can’t you tell the difference between an attack and a greeting?”
“You are nothing but a mangy, feral mutt. Snapping at me is the only thing you know how to do. And Phynar is equally pathetic. He’s such a terrible king he can’t even keep his own subordinates on their leashes,” humphed Carrot Top. “Speaking of subordinates, it seems you’ve done quite the number on mine.”Oh, would you look at that? He already knows. Huh, weird. I could’ve sworn I had all the assholes I fought reincarnated as fertilizer. I guess I must’ve missed one or something. The only alternative I could think of was that someone had found their corpses alongside some sort of evidence linking me to their untimely demises. Oh well, whatever. It’s not like I give a fuck. I wasn’t really planning on feigning innocence anyway.“Oh, that? Yeah, that was me. You know, you’re talking shit, but it kinda seems like you don’t really have all that much control over your men either. All I needed to do was fuck ‘em up a bit, and they started talking my ear off. They went ahead and told me everything. You know, about the people who orchestrated the attack, their reasons, and even all the shit you guys were planning.” I drew Enne as I jeered.Naturally, I was just taunting him. The truth of the matter was that there was only one guy that talked, and he had been pretty damned tight lipped—at least until I pulled out another dagger and threatened to make him hallucinate all over again. Apparently, not even he was willing to sit through a second set of nightmares, hence why he opted to switch from remaining in defiance to lecturing me about the fiends’ plans. Of course, I paid him back in kind for his cooperation. I made sure to help him along and have him join his men in reincarnating as a lump of dirt.My words served their purpose. They irked him so much that his expression finally began to break. The cocky mask he wore wavered as his face twitched in anger.“Was an itty bitty comment really all it took to get on your nerves? Wow, aren’t you sensitive?” I said. “I mean, I don’t know if you know yet, so I guess I’mma point it out just in case. That little shit-eating grin you’ve got there is starting to get all messed up, dude. You might wanna have it checked. I mean, come on. All I’m really talking about is a trusted agent stabbing you in the back and telling me everything I could have possibly wanted to know. It really shouldn’t be getting your panties in a knot. And even if it does, it’s not like it’s my fault. It’s kinda yours. You really need to work on the whole discipline thing. But you know, it’s okay. I understand. I know it’s hard for a nitwit like you to get your shit together.”
“I do not need yo—”The moment he started talking was the moment I attacked. I kicked off the ground, charged right at him, and swung Enne. All while ignoring everything that came out of his mouth. Though he was confused, he avoided the attack with a backwards leap. The swiftness and grace that accompanied the action almost seemed out of place given his hulking frame.“Do you have any intention of listening to me?” His voice came out in a low growl. His eyes narrowed and the veins in his forehead buldged as the blood rushed to his head. He was angry, but he managed to stop himself short of exploding. “It was my turn to speak.”
“Turns? You wanted to take turns? Bitch, please. If you wanna sit down in a circle and take turns jerking off, then you can go find yourself someone more ‘sophisticated.’”It immediately became clear to me that Carrot Top had little exposure to the steps that needed to be taken in order to annoy others. Woooow. Someone’s clearly never passed third grade.“I almost can’t believe it. You’re just as unpleasant as Phynar is.” Carrot Top heaved a deep sigh. “Fine. If you’re so desperate for a fight that you’re willing to waste your own time annoying me, I suppose I might as well oblige.”A fierce grin appeared on his face as he thrusted an arm out in front of him. Copious amounts of mana gathered around his open palm and came together to take the shape of a greatsword. It was a massive weapon. I had no doubt that it would be able to cleave a man in half with a single swing. Crimson vein-like structures ran along the side of its sinister blade, a blade that almost seemed darker than black itself. Shapewise, it almost seemed to resemble Hasai, the weapon I had used before getting my hands on Enne. That said, it seemed much, much stronger, especially when given its nature.“Oh, great, a magic blade.”***

???Description: Tortund Ruin is a blade known as disaster incarnate. It brings in its wake death and destruction. Those that face it know no hope, and those that wield it are doomed to a life filled with conflict and strife. This weapon has the tendency to rob its wielder of their sanity in exchange for a momentous boost to their stats.***The weapon’s sinister aura resembled Enne’s. More specifically, the old Enne’s. Analyze had told me a lot about it, but even without it, I would have known that Carrot Top’s blade was cursed. And powerful. Extremely. Powerful. Seeing its stats had only served to further the point.That was why I was surprised to see that it was fully under his control. It seemed to have submitted to him in spite of its overinflated numbers.He took a one-handed stance as he raised before smirking in contentment.“I’m surprised you could tell,” said the ginger. “It has been screaming incessantly ever since I drew it.” He suddenly accelerated as he put his foot on the ground and broke into a dash. “For your blood!”The distance between us vanished in the blink of an eye. Because I moved too.I met the heavy horizontal slash that he delivered the moment I stepped into his range with a full forced swing of my own. It was a head-on clash, a violent confrontation from which only the strongest would come out on top.Our blades sang. A high pitched ring as loud as a literal explosion resounded through the stadium. His attack bore all the weight of an 18-wheeler. My arm felt like it had been hit by a literal truck. The sensation pulsed up the extended limb, worked its way through my body, and eventually channeled itself into the ground below. And yet, I stayed firm.So excessive was the wind pressure generated by the impact that our clothes began to tear.Neither of us were able to bear it for much longer. We ended up getting pushed back at the exact same time. The fuck!? He’s as strong as I am!?Killing the Douchelord had provided me with a drastic boost to all my stats. And since then, I had always assumed that I would have an easy time overpowering anything that didn’t inhabit the Wicked Forest. And yet, here I was was dueling someone capable of meeting my attacks head on. I mean, sure, strength isn’t exactly my highest stat, but I’ve still got like 3k. That’s not counting the buffs I get from Enne either. How the actual fuck are we going even!?It wasn’t as if I was getting all full of myself. I didn’t have my ass on a high horse, and I wasn’t what I would call conceited. That said, I was still well aware of the fact that my strength stat was a whole order of magnitude higher than the norm. Being matched in a contest of raw power was the last thing I had expected—especially since even the sword saint had done his best to avoid a head-on clash.I knew that, like me, he had a weapon that boosted his stats, but even so, I immediately came to understand that Carrot Top himself was a genuine, undeniable powerhouse. And apparently, the understanding was mutual.“You can deflect my blows? Consider me impressed!” The ginger swiveled around and delivered a diagonal slash as he shouted. It was a downwards smash, one that made full use of centrifugal force to bolster its weight. Under normal circumstances, I would have dodged it. But I couldn’t. Not because I was trapped. But because I felt obligated not to back down in the face of his violence. Relenting was no different from admitting that he was better than me, the thought of which irked me to no end.That was why I lowered my stance, dug my feet into the ground, and used Enne to deliver a powerful, rising slash.Again, we clashed. And again, raw strength was pit against brute force.We continued to be repelled in tandem. Both of us kept getting blown away by the force of the impact at the exact same time. Still, we continued. We both refused to back down and continued to engage in a series of clashes honest and telegraphed to the point of stupidity.Though we were doing nothing but smashing our weapons against each other, the crowd had gone wild. They cheered and jeered at the top of their lungs. But neither of us thought anything of it. We were too focused on crushing each other, on defeating the foe whose power we had recognized.While I had claimed that the battle was straight forward, I was obviously far too underhanded to leave it that way by choice. The only reason I wasn’t using my spells to cheat was because I couldn’t. I had tried casting several, but every single one had failed to activate. Magic just refused to work. I could channel my mana the same way I normally could, but my spells would peter out the moment I tried to construct them. Is one of his skills messing with my ability to cast? Seems like it. Hell, that’s probably the same thing that stopped me from analyzing him. It’s probably also why the mine he stepped on didn’t do jack shit. Wait. Why is it that I can analyze his weapon, then? Is that ‘cause some sort of loophole…? Ehhhh, whatever, fuck it. I’ll think about it later. Brooding isn’t going to do me any good in the middle of a fight. Especially since I can’t see myself figuring it out.“It is quite unfortunate that you can’t cast any of your spells, isn’t it?” He flashed the cockiest of grins as he spoke.
“The fuck are you talking about?” I played him off by staying cool. “I don’t even need magic to crush a shithead like you.”It wasn’t as if his skill made him untouchable. The fact that he hadn’t used any sort of magic despite having plenty of opportunities to cast proved that his defenses came with some sort of limitation or drawback. But again, I wasn’t all that keen on figuring it out. I had already decided that I was going to crush him with nothing but physical force alone.That was why I emulated the old butler. When our next clash happened, I ever so slightly shifted the point of impact. The change caused his blade to slide along Enne as opposed to meeting her head-on, and thereby threw him off balance.“Take this, numbnuts!” I took his lack of steadiness as an opportunity to step forward, take a hand off Enne, and slug him in the jaw. He tanked it well. He managed to plant his feet and stop himself from falling over, but the blow was far too heavy for him to simply endure. The momentum caused him to kick up a cloud of dust as he slid back several meters.“You okay, Enne?” I raised a voice in concern. I’d smashed her against his blade on more than just a few occasions.
“…Mhm. I won’t lose.” The reaction I got out of her was one I could only think of as unusual. She was giving off an aura of competitiveness. She seemed like she was raring to go for a second round.Seeing me speak to my weapon caused Carrot Top to laugh. “I see I’m not the only one with a cursed weapon.”
“Cursed? Cursed? Bitch please, what do you mean, ‘cursed?’ Enne’s the sweetest thing that this world has to offer. You can take your stupid assumptions and shove ‘em ten feet up your ass.”
“Well, whatever the case, I say we should have ourselves a bit of a contest. Let’s see which of our weapons reigns superior.” He rubbed his jaw with one of his hands as he spoke and took up another stance with his blade before suddenly lowering his stance and clicking his tongue. All the fight had drained from him in an instant.“Now!”Dozens upon dozens of guards charged onto the stage, led by none other than Carrot Top’s bitch boy, the man that had been standing behind him when he was up in the box reserved only for the most important of VIPs.They stood between us to break up the fight. But that said, their treatment of us was clearly unequal. Every single guard was facing me. They were holding large riot shields and attempting to surround me in order to prevent me from launching any more attacks.“God damn it! Get out of my way!”Naturally, I fought them off. I relied on punches and kicks in order to brute force my way through, but it didn’t work. They kept getting back on the stage and rejoining the encirclement every single time I sent them flying through the air. Under normal circumstances, making use of the third dimension would have been my solution of choice. Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible. Some of the guards were airborne and working to stop me from doing exactly that. Ughhhhh. I’m not going to be able to get through unless I kill them. Hmmm… Should I? I mean, I could… Hell, it’d be pretty easy, but… I probably shouldn’t.If I was alone, I probably would have followed through on that exact thought. I would have brutally murdered every single member of the security force in cold blood. It wasn’t my moral compass that was stopping me from following through, but rather, Enne. I didn’t want to expose her to excessive violence or carnage. I didn’t want her to think murder was normal. Okay, and I know what you’re saying. Blah blah blah, weapon, used to kill people, blah blah. You kill monsters and shit all the time, blah. Yeah, I know. But you see, it’s just not the same. The guards aren’t trying to kill me. They’re not enemies I’ve sworn to kill, and they’re not mindless monsters out to get me either. They’re just average people stuck in an unfortunate line of work. I don’t want to stain her with their blood, nor expose her to senseless, unjustified violence. She’s my daughter. I’m not about to put her through that. No good father would. I guess that means it’s time for magic. Ooooorrr, at least it would be if I could actually fucking using it!“What the fuck! Get over here, you pussy!”
“We will not be able to freely swing our swords with this many guards around,” said Carrot Top. “Don’t worry. I am sure we will have another chance to finish this battle some other time.”He grinned wide enough to put his fangs on display as he put his sword back into wherever he had taken it from, turned around, and walked away.“Chief! How are your wounds!?”
“I am fine. I wasn’t wounded,” said the redhead. “What have I told you about getting in the way of my battles? You better be prepared for the consequences.”
“I am willing to accept whatever punishment you wish, chief, but please do bear in mind that I acted out of concern for your safety.”
“…I cannot deny that,” grumbled Carrot Top. “Fine. You’re right. You’ve done well. While I would have liked for our duel to last much longer, I suppose I’ve fought him for long enough to appease the crowd.”
“Shit! What the hell! Get the fuck back here! You won’t! Fucking limpdick!” I practically screamed at him, but Carrot Top ignored me. He didn’t bother so much as even acknowledging my words. He simply continued to leave with his aide in tow. Fuck! This motherfucker’s getting away! If only I could use the dungeon’s powers! Arghhh!<– Prev — Next –>

A Transient Farewell
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerI found myself at the bar the day after I gave Gojim the metaphorical finger. Naturally, picking a fight with him had gotten me disqualified from the tournament and kicked out of the arena. Speaking of the tourney, they’re probably off doing the finals or whatever right now, huh? Rip my shot at first place.There wasn’t much I could say in my defence. I deserved getting the boot, and probably much more. Picking a fight with one of the country’s most important people, and in public at that, wasn’t exactly what I would call my best idea. Thinking about things more rationally, I came to realize that killing him in the presence of so many was far from practical. His presence apparently nullified my ability to cast spells, which meant the battle would have been long, drawn-out, and much closer than I would have wanted it to be. His guards had basically been guaranteed to step in before I could finish him. Wait, what if I used Sovereign Pressure and just KO’d them all like I did in the prelims? It’s a skill, so it functions differently from spells and whatnot, so it might not have gotten cancelled. Errr, wait, no, I’m stupid. Who am I kidding? All it really does is bash my mana into everyone else’s. It basically works the exact same way a spell does. Yeah, it’d probably get nullified too. God damn it!Man, I can’t help but think that I could’ve roughed him up a bit more if I played my cards differently. Oh well, no use crying over spilt milk. It’s not like I know exactly how strong he is either since I can’t analyze him and whatnot. Yeah, fuck it. I’mma just stop thinking about it.Cutting off my inner monologue, I turned my focus back towards the old butler-cum-swordsman sitting across from me. We were at the bar that Nell and I had visited and in the midst of a brief meeting. Though we were the only two talking, my two companions, Enne and Leila, were both also present.“Wherever did the hero wind up?” asked the old man.
“Don’t worry, she’s safe. I ended up having to do a bit of fighting and didn’t want her caught up in it, so I had her head over to my place.” I said. “Sorry if that messes with your plans or whatever.”
“Please don’t worry about it. Her safety is much more important than whatever plans we had,” he said with a firm nod. “Does that mean you live nearby?”
“Uhhh, not really? It’s actually pretty far, but I can assure you that it’s about as safe as safe gets.”
“I presume that means you made use of a spell or item that manipulates spacetime?”
“Yeah, pretty much. Something like that.”We were safe to discuss whatever we wished without resorting to speaking in hushed tones, and not because the bar was loud enough to ensure that we wouldn’t be overheard. In fact, it was exactly the opposite. The place was more or less empty and devoid of other customers.“Whatever the case, you’ve done me a truly unforgettable favour. Thank you.” The butler furrowed his brows as his expression twisted into one filled with regret. “You were forced to step in because I was unable to help her when she needed it most.”
“Hey, relax. Don’t beat yourself up over it. It wasn’t really your fault. Just a case of bad timing.” My lips twisted into a bit of a wry grin.The only way I could really describe everything that had occurred was to call it a series of unfortunate events. Apparently, the butler and I were tasked with the exact same duty. That is, both of us had entered the tournament to prove our strengths. In his case, he had to demonstrate that humans were deserved recognition, that they too could be true warriors worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with demonkind’s finest. He was going to function as their race’s face while Nell ran around behind the scenes recruiting allies. Unfortunately, splitting up their party had led to trouble on both ends. He had been stuck in a match against me whilst Nell found herself fighting for her life.As someone that was not exactly completely involved in everything that was going on behind the scenes, I hadn’t known all that much as to exactly what Nell was involved in. That said, a certain black-clothed agent had been more than willing to tell me all that I needed to know. According to him, it had all been nothing short of a coincidence.He had simply been preparing to dismantle the wingbearers. They were too powerful to be left to their own devices. As all their advances and offers had all resulted in failure, the fiends had judged that the wingbearers were unlikely to join them. Their prudence led them to decide that they should crush the tribe before it could become one of their enemies’ allies.His plan was perfect. He had found a man on the inside, and through him, spread the fiends’ influence. The two of them managed to create an entire faction willing to fight for fiendish ideals. The stage was set. So they attacked. If all went according to plan, the wingbearers would have fallen overnight and been reborn as a group willing to listen to the fiends’ every whim. But their scheme was torn apart. By Nell. Her presence had been a bolt from the blue. They hadn’t accounted for her. Not her might, nor the fact that she would resist them until the moment she drew her last breath. The hero had not only singlehandedly prevented him from following through on his genocide, but also nearly destroyed his unit.Total failure was on the horizon. The only saving grace was the fact that the assault did ultimately diminish the wingbearers’ power as a faction. Still, the operation had not been worth the cost. They lost far too many, especially given that I had effectively wiped out all that remained. Moreover, the remaining wingbearers now found themselves amongst those that antagonized the fiends. They were under the king’s umbrella now. He had promised them their safety in exchange for their cooperation. And they had gratefully complied. I mean, I didn’t really bother doing anything more than just shooting them a glance or two, but their stats seemed pretty high. I’m sure Mr. Black Hearted Demon King over there’ll be able to put them to good us—er, cooperate with them. Yeah, that.“So what’re your plans looking like? You know, with how things have changed and whatnot,” I asked.
“I will be remaining in the demon realm and act alongside the two of our companions that you have yet to meet. Mekina and Ronia will be returning to their homelands in order to report on the status quo. I believe that they may very well have already left, as they asked me to thank you for them in the case that we met.”Wow. There were a whole six of them? Wasn’t really expecting that.“They did? Well uh, in that case, give ‘em my regards, I guess.”
“I will do exactly that,” said the old butler. His kind, cheerful tone vanished not too long after the words left his mouth. He replaced his smile with an expression as serious as serious could be. “Again, Yuki, I must thank you for what you have done. You have done nothing but give us unconditional assistance. Please, please let me know if there is anything that I can do for you. I am past my prime and unable to accomplish as much as I would have been able to in my youth, but I am willing to dedicate my all to repaying you for your kindness. Your wish is my command, good sir.”
“Dude, chill,” I said. “Look man, I only did what I felt like doing. It was all for me. You really don’t owe me jack.”
“Your intent changes nothing,” said the old man. “In the end, you still took my place and protected those that I was duty-bound but unable to. My debt to you is a fact, and it is one I cannot allow myself not to repay.”I had the feeling that he wasn’t about to drop the subject regardless of what I said or did. There didn’t really seem to be any point in fighting the old mule in a battle of obstinance, so I decided to think through my options. After a brief pause, I slowly opened my mouth and voiced the best suggestion that had come to mind.“Well, how about this, old-timer? Once you’re done with all this mission stuff, and whatnot, how about you teach me how to use a sword?”
“A sword, you say?”
“Yeah. I can’t really figure out why, but me and swords just don’t really mesh well. I’ve got plenty of dex, but I just can’t figure it out. I’m planning on heading home for now, so it’ll obviously have to wait. But since you and Nell are working together, I figure we’ll probably see each other again eventually.”
“Hmmm…” the old man pondered for a moment. “The numbers that go with one’s status values are just a rough estimate. They are not necessarily accurate. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and status values often fail to account for them. Very well, I would be glad to teach you swordplay should the chance ever arise.”
“Thanks man, appreciate it. I’ve been wanting to get better at handling her, you see, so not knowing how to use a sword’s been a bit of a pain in the ass for quite some time now.” I gave the girl in my lap a pat on the head as I spoke.She didn’t offer much of a response, and not because of her taciturn nature. Enne was simply too busy shoveling meat into her mouth to speak. As far as I was concerned, her actions were justified. The food here is pretty damn good, after all.“I’ve already seen the process myself, and yet, I still find it difficult to believe that she is your weapon’s incarnation. How truly bizarre…” he muttered.After a brief pause, the sword girl caught onto the fact that she was being stared at, so she stuck her fork through a chunk of meat and pushed it towards the old butler. “You can have a piece. But only one.”Her actions prompted him to chuckle in a way that only kind old men could. “Thank you little lady, but please don’t mind me and enjoy your meal.”
“Mind your manners, Enne. Holding up a piece of meat like that is rude,” said Leila.
“…Okay.”The sheep girl’s scolding led Enne to bring the fork back from its extended position and pop it into her mouth. All while the butler watched over her with a gentle smile.***The last stop we made that day was the demon king’s throne room. I found myself standing in front of him with both my companions in tow.“Yeah, so uh, my bad. I kinda got myself disqualified without telling you what I was going to do.”
“That’s okay!” he said with a smile. “There’s no need to worry. You’ve already gone above and beyond anyway. We got much more done than we were expecting to.”While his tone sounded cheerful and boyish, I could tell that there was much more than just that to it. In fact, I almost felt as if I had caught a glimpse of the sinister, scheming nature that lay beneath his happy-go-lucky mask. I could already tell that he had done many a thing behind the scenes. And that was why I couldn’t help but force a bit of a smile.While I had no idea as to exactly what the demon realm’s king had accomplished, I was at least cultured enough to imagine it. My suspicions seemed to lead towards one of three possibilities: crushing enemy strongholds, planting double agents in positions of power, and creating internal conflicts. Or maybe even all three. Who knows?According to the king, all anyone needed to do to be recognized as a fiend was to declare that they were one. As such, infiltration was easy. Or at least that’s what the king’s been saying, but he seems pretty smart when it comes to plotting shit behind people’s backs, so I kinda doubt I can just take his word for it.Whatever the case, the king’s subordinates had managed a series of achievements while the enemy was too focused on me to stop them. They were still at an undeniable disadvantage given their lack of numbers, but the king was happy nonetheless, as he had apparently sown the seeds for the future.“Oh right, why didn’t you warn me about the old human dude I had to fight? He was tough as nails.”
“He was? I thought you won pretty easily. He didn’t even scratch you.”Yeah, I mean, nothing I can say to that, but it’s about the sentiment! Seriously! Like, if he’s not strong, then who is? He was definitely the toughest guy there by a long shot.“To be honest, I didn’t think he would be that strong,” said Phynar. “It seems that humans really aren’t to be underestimated after all.”
“Yeah, I really could’ve used a warning, goddammit. He caught me hella off guard.”
“I’m sorry,” said the demon king with a heartfelt laugh. “Right, are you sure you didn’t need to be seen off?”
“I can pretty much get home instantly, so yeah, I’m good. Sorry about half-assing everything, especially seeing how you paid me in full anyway.”
“I’m just paying you what I think you’re worth. You’ve already gone the extra mile, after all. All I really wanted, this time around, was for you to enter the tournament. Besides, you will be returning, won’t you?”
“Yeah, I’m not exactly satisfied with leaving things how they are right now either.”Carrot Top wasn’t someone I could simply leave be. He was an enemy of mine, through and through, and I had every intention of stabbing him in the face. That said, I had already been away from the dungeon for a rather extended period of time. I was feeling kinda worried, so I decided to head back for a bit before settling things once and for all.“I take it you’ll be willing to help me out again when the time comes?” asked Phynar. “I’m sure you’d be plenty interested after seeing how much I’m paying, right?”
“Oh, so that’s why I’m getting paid so much. You and your goddamn schemes.”
“I would rather you call it ingenuity.”The two of us grinned at each other.“Well, Yuki, girls, I hope to see you again,” said Phynar.
“Yeah, see ya,” I said. “And you too, Haloria. Thanks for showing us around and stuff.”
“Thank you very much for your hospitality. Be well, Haloria,” said Leila.
“Bye,” said Enne.
“I’m very glad to have been of service!” said Haloria. For some odd reason, she was starting to tear up. “Farewell, everyone.”With smiles on our faces, Leila, Enne, and I departed from the demon king’s castle.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: Leila’s Little Sister — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix“Well girls? It’s time to kick back, relax, and enjoy the festivities!” I spoke in a cheerful tone as I walked through Regighihegg’s streets with Enne and Leila in tow. The first of the two girls was walking by my side with her hand in mine, while the other trailed a few steps behind us in a manner reminiscent of a guardian.My bright demeanour stemmed from two sources. The first was the fact that the city had gone into holiday mode. You could practically feel the festive spirit oozing off its citizens as they happily strolled about. Now that I had completed the preliminaries, I too could join them in enjoying the celebration that was Destia Trome.The second contributor to my mood was my wallet. Or rather, the wallet that the demon king had lent me. It was loaded, which meant that, by proxy, I was too. I could splurge on anything I wanted, and I wouldn’t be losing a cent. Free shit best shit.“Let me know if you see anything that catches your eye, Enne. You can have anything you want.”
“Anything?”
“Yeah, anything!”She stopped for a moment to scan her surroundings before knitting her brows. “I can’t pick. There are too many options.”
“You seem to be enjoying yourself, My Lord.” An exasperated smile surfaced on Leila’s face.
“That’s ‘cause I am,” I said. “I mean, why not, right? The whole point of an event like this is to have fun, so I’m doing exactly that.”Destia Trome was the first celebratory event Enne had ever experienced. I wanted her to enjoy it. I wanted to turn it into something she’d remember for years to come. Yeah, that! I’m totally not just dicking around ‘cause I wanna have fun. Ahahahaha…Man, I kinda regret not bringing everyone. I really want all the other kids to be able to experience this kinda thing too. I know it’s probably not the safest thing, but it’s honestly not really all that dangerous either. It seems safe enough around here for me to not be on edge about something happening to them. And having Lefi around would pretty much guarantee that everyone ends up just fine. Now that I think about it, maybe I was just being a bit too overprotective. Ehhh… nah. Things were getting pretty hairy with those bandits when we were still on our way over. They were launching arrows at us, so who knows what could’ve happened. Yeah, fuck it, I was right the first time. Having fun is important, but safety comes first. Plus, everything falls apart with the whole Lefi not wanting to come thing. Not having her around makes things a lot more dangerous. Why didn’t she want to come anyway? She said something about it being a case of bad timing and whatnot, but is that even really a thing? Like, what does bad timing even mean when all she does is laze around all day in the first place?“Oh forget it. I’ll just ask her when I get back.” I muttered under my breath in a low tone before turning back towards Enne. “So? You see anything you want?”
“I want to try that.”The sword girl pointed towards a stall that seemed extremely popular with children in particular. Dozens of the little buggers were gathered around it and screaming with delight as they shot magical bullets at targets that looked like soft, glowing balls of energy.“What is that anyway…?”
“That would be a popular carnival game, My Lord,” said Leila. “It requires two types of enchanted items. The first employs illusion magic to create targets, while the second fires low power projectiles. It costs very little to set up, so you often see at least one at every major event.”Her description led me to recall the shooting range-like carnival games that we had back on earth. Is it just me, or does this world’s version actually look a hella lot better? The targets move, and the whole thing seems all bright and flashy ‘cause of all the magic. It looks way more interesting than the old cork guns we were stuck with. Damn. And here I was thinking that my old world’s tech would always come out on top. TIL not to look down on this world’s tech advancements.“Sounds good. Whaddya say we give it a shot?”
“Mhm!” Enne nodded as she started walking in the shooting range’s direction.***The afternoon came and went. Enne, Leila, and I enjoyed the festivities to our heart’s content. We basically participated in everything that caught our attention. It was an eventful day for sure, but apparently, it was far from over.“L-Leila!? Is that really you, Leila!?”An unfamiliar voice prompted all three of us to turn around right as we began contemplating dinner.“I-It really is you! You were ok!? I’m so glad!”The voice’s source was a girl with goat horns. The robe she wore was about as loose as robes got, and yet, it did nothing to save her from giving off the impression that she was tiny. She was only the slightest bit taller than Enne. If I was to slap a grade on her, I would have said she was somewhere between seven and nine. She was too old to be in primary school, but she didn’t quite look big enough to be in her mid or late teens just yet.The most notable thing about her wasn’t the fact that her horns kind of looked like Leila’s, nor the fact that she was too small for her oversized robe, but rather, her expression. Her jaw had dropped to the point where I thought it might be unhinged. Her eyes were so focused on Leila’s face that I suspected they might have started firing lasers.“It’s good to see you again too, Emyu.” The dungeon’s resident demon girl replied in her usual, nonchalant manner. Unlike the other girl, she didn’t come anywhere close to overreacting.
“Someone you know? I can already tell she seems pretty attached to you.”
“Yes. She is something along the lines of a sister to me. I used to tutor her when I worked in the demon realm.”Something along the lines of a sister…? I guess that means they’re close, but not actually related? I see… so that probably means she’s like her protege or something.The girl she had called Emyu almost seemed to be overcome with emotion. She began running over with tears in her eyes—only to come to a sudden stop the moment she realized that Leila wasn’t alone.“W-Wait, you have a daughter!? When did that happen!?” Her eyes practically popped out of their sockets. “And why are you dressed like a servant!?”Evidently, she had mistaken Enne for Leila’s daughter and overreacted as a result.“Alright, let’s just calm down.” I understood that she was confused and overwhelmed by all sorts of different emotions, so I spoke in as gentle a tone as I could manage in order to avoid putting her on guard. “Take a deep breath a—”
“H-How dare you! You couldn’t just stop at stealing her chastity! You had to humiliate her by dressing her up as a maidservant of all things and forcing her to attend to you! What sort of cruel, sadistic pervert are you!?”
“Hey Leila? You mind doing something about her? This uh… ‘sister’ of yours seems to be having a bit of an aneurysm.”
“I’m sorry, My Lord, but there isn’t much to be done. Unfortunately Emyu happens to have an overactive imagination.”Yeaaaah… I can kinda see that.“W-Wait, why is he a Demon Lord!? What’s something as horrible as a labyrinth’s overlord doing in the middle of town!?” She took a few quick steps back as her wariness shot through the roof.The way she reacted to each and every little thing was a trait that I found endearing in its own right. The impression I got from her was very much akin to the kind you’d normally get from a kitten.“Wait, you can tell?” I cocked an eyebrow. “Oh yeah, that reminds me, you could tell back when we first met too, right, Leila? Is it really that obvious? I always assumed no one knew, but I’m starting to feel like I might’ve been walking around with my fly down the whole time.”
“Our race happens to be especially well attuned to detecting that sort of thing, and we’re inherently skilled in analyzing our findings.”Huh… That’s weird. Now that I think about it, Leila certainly has always seemed abnormally sharp. Doesn’t look like it’s being caused by a skill either. After a bit of internal banter, I reached the conclusion that Emyu likely shared Leila’s acuity and left it at that. Though uh, looks like she’s a biiiiiiit lacking on the analysis front. Maybe she’s just outta practice?“O-Oh no! I get it now! He must have worked you to the bone and forced you to abide by his every whim no matter how tired or humiliated you were! And then, when night came, he must have dragged you off to his bedroom and made you attend to his desires all night long even though you were already completely drained by the grueling work he put you through during the day! That’s just horrible! I’m so sorry, Leila! I’m so sorry you had to go through all that!”Bruh. Hold up. Is it just me, or is she going further into the deep end? Oh, and in case any of you were starting to doubt me, I am NOT a registered sex offender. Clapping cheeks without consent isn’t my thing. Just saying.“…Excuse me. You’re wrong.” Enne stepped forward to come to my defence.
“W-what do you want? This has nothing to do with you!” stuttered shortstuff.
“I’m Enne. That’s my Master,” she pointed at me before shifting her finger in Leila’s direction. “Leila’s our friend. She’s not my mother.”
“Really…? So you’re not Leila and the Demon Lord’s kid?”
“No. I’m not. And Master doesn’t do mean things like that.”Enne linked arms with me for emphasis as she nodded. Oh man, just look at her! Her expression hasn’t changed at all. Totally adorable/10.“That’s not possible! Demon lords don’t have a shred of intelligence! They’re basically incarnations of lust and stupidity, and the only thing they ever do is abide by their most primal desires! There’s absolutely no way that anything that brainless could possibly keep its loins in check in the face of Leila’s beauty!”Alright, let’s get a few things straight. Yes, Leila is literally one of the hottest girls I’ve ever seen in both my lives. Like shit, she turns heads. Like. Lots of them. I’ll admit, if I didn’t know her and I happened to pass her by, I’d probably turn around and stare. Because let’s be honest, who wouldn’t want a piece of that ass? Anyway, back on topic. Yes, Leila’s hot as fuck. Yes, I pretty much do whatever the hell I want. But that doesn’t mean me doing her is going to happen. ‘Cause uh, yeah. That sounds like an idea that would get Lefi to set me on fire and almost turn me into a pile of ash before tearing me limb from limb, and burying my disembodied corpse somewhere deep in the Wicked Forest. Yeah, uh, no. I kinda don’t want to never be seen or heard of again, so I’mma keep my dick to myself, thank you very much.One thought prompted by the contemplation of Leila’s beauty was that all of the dungeon’s girls were in fact top tier. Each was more than attractive enough to make even supermodels shy away in shame. Maybe we should start an idol group. Might as well have ‘em function as a unit and compete for the top spot. I could be their producer, and we could spend our days struggling through the melodrama we call life…“Mmmrph…” Enne puffed out her cheeks. “Master isn’t like that.”
“She’s right, Emyu. You’re being terribly rude,” said Leila. “I’m serving him of my own free will in order to repay him for his kindness.”
“N-Not you too, Leila!”I shook off the delusion I was having and started paying attention to the conversation again, only to realize that the sheep-horned girl was scolding the other.“I see…” she stuttered apologetically. “I’m sorry. I always assumed that all demon lords were evil and stupid. That was really rude of me.”Wow. She pretty much apologized the moment she realized she was in the wrong. Colour me impressed. People as sincere as her are pretty hard to come by.“Don’t worry about it, short stuff. I get it, you were just worried about her.”
“I’m sorry for all the troub—wait! Did you just call me short!? How dare you! I knew it, I knew demon lords and intellectuals could never get along! We were doomed to be mortal enemies from the very start!” she screamed. “I’m not short! I’m just not fully grown yet! I’m going to look just like Leila one day! I’m going to be just as tall, and my chest is going to be just as big!”
“…Mmrph. Master’s enemies are my enemies.”
“Fine! Bring it on! I’ll destroy anyone that sides with the likes of a demon lord!”Emyu’s body tensed up in a manner reminiscent of a hissing cat while Enne took up a stance with a non-existent blade.As the situation was both amusing and bizarre, my lips twisted into a bit of an exasperated smile.“Alright you two. Rein it in. It’s time for dinner, so how about we go grab ourselves something to eat?”<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: Leila’s Little Sister — Part 2
Editors: SpeedphoenixIt was getting a bit late, so Enne, Leila, her sister, and I decided to grab a bite as we talked. We found ourselves a table at a nice, outdoor, patio-like picnic area as soon as we finished raiding the area’s stalls and buying everything we felt the urge to consume. Naturally, what followed was an overdue explanation. Leila briefly went over her experiences outside the demon realm as the other girl nibbled at this world’s equivalent of grilled corn on the cob.“So that’s what happened…” Emyu’s eyes opened wide as her beloved “sister” wrapped up her tale.
“I’m sorry I didn’t get in touch. You must have been terribly worried,” said Leila.
“T-that’s okay! I know that what you went through was much, much worse…” stuttered the younger demon. “Does that mean you won’t be coming back to the institution anymore?”
“I will not. The institution is too bor—stagnant. The institution is too much of a self-contained environment. There are not enough chances for us to gain new experiences or learn new things. It is not the type of place that will inspire you to come up with any sort of breakthrough. That would be why I’m planning to stay with My Lord for the foreseeable future.”I heard that. She tried to cover it up, but I heard her loud and clear. She totally just complained that it was boring. You know, that’s actually pretty rare. Leila isn’t usually the type to let her thoughts leak like that. Though, now that I think about it, she’s actually pretty bold and assertive. I can’t believe I never actually noticed.“Okay! I’ll save you the trouble of visiting and make sure I tell the naggy old hag that you’re not coming back!”
”Thank you very much, Emyu,” giggled Leila. A warm, affectionate expression surfaced as she gently ran her fingers through the other girl’s hair. Observing their interactions led me to understand why Leila had always seemed so good at looking after the dungeon’s younger residents. Taking care of Emyu had given her plenty of experience with kids.
“Wait, so you’re not even going back to visit? You sure?” I asked. “Don’t you need to see your family and whatnot? I’m sure they’re worried about you.”We never really spoke about it, so I didn’t know much about Leila’s family situation, but I felt that there had to have been someone that had lost sleep over her sudden disappearance, even if said person wasn’t related to her by blood. Her interactions with Emyu led me to believe that her people were a part of a tight-knit community. Yeahhhh… They’d probably really appreciate if she stopped by, even if just to say hi.“There’s really no need,” said Leila. “Since time immemorial, we sheep-horned demons have always gone wherever our interests have taken us. We are driven to explore the world by none other than our own thirst for knowledge.”
“So what you’re saying is that it’s normal for people to just suddenly poof one day and never come back?”
“Precisely, My Lord. Emyu is still quite young, so she will likely remain in the village for several years to come, but I expect that she too will likely set out once she comes of age,” said Leila. “Besides, if there is anyone that needs to visit their homes, it would be Lyuu.”
“Wait, what?” Why’d she suddenly bring up Ms. Useless?
“I believe she was captured the moment she ran away from home. Her parents must be terribly worried.”
“Seriously? She ran away from home? I had no idea…”
“…Right. I just remembered that I promised her I wouldn’t tell you.” Leila averted her gaze and brought a hand to her mouth. She clearly recognized that she had messed up.Dude. Seriously!? Lyuu ran away from home!? Actually, now that she mentions it, I do vaguely recall her saying something about people telling her not to leave… Hmmm…“Yeah, uh yeah… I guess I should probably have her head home for a bit, huh?”
“She told me not to tell you, so I don’t think she wants to, but I do agree that speaking to her about it would be for the best.”
“Yeah, I’mma do just that once we get home.”Like, let’s just consider how her parents feel for a moment. Their daughter ran away from home and totally vanished, only to end up working as a maid for some random guy they know nothing about. Yeaaaaahhhh… If I was her dad, I’d probably want to strangle me. She should probably go home and tell them that she’s okay before time makes things even worse. “Okay, fine! You may be a demon lord, but I’ll still at least acknowledge the fact that you saved Leila! Thank you very much for that! But don’t let me thanking you get to your head! You’re not off the hook just yet! I swear, if you ever break her heart, I’m going to murder you in your sleep! Don’t ever forget that!”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. But uh, more importantly, I think you might want to mind your hands. The sauce on your skewer is kinda dripping all over the place.”
“It is…? Oh no, it is! My robe! My robe!! It’s gotten so filthy!”The sauce her corncob was covered in had begun dribbling all over the place the moment she stopped paying attention to it.“Oh Emyu, you never change,” said Leila. “Hold still.”The older sheep-horned girl began wiping off her younger counterpart with a handkerchief as she sighed in a clear expression of exasperation.“I can wipe it off myself! I’m not that much of a kid anymore!”
“Actions speak louder than words, Emyu. If you would like me not to fuss over you, then you will have to make it such that I no longer need to.”I couldn’t help but break into a hearty laugh. Leila had a point, and a pretty good one at that.“Curse you, Demon Lord!”
“Don’t be so rude, Emyu. He has a name,” scolded Leila. “It would be best for you to refer to him as Lord Yuki.”
“Ugh… fine. I’ll use his stupid name!” she groaned as she spun between Leila and I. “Cut that out, Yuki! What are you even laughing at!?”It went without saying that the brat didn’t respect me, not even in the slightest, so she immediately dropped the title Leila had suggested and referred to me with just my name.“Nothing special. Just that you two get along really well,” I chuckled. “Right, Enne?”
“Mhm. They’re just like us.”
“Yeah! Pretty much.”Did she really just say that? Hnnnng. Enne really is just the sweetest little thing, ain’t she? I immediately decided to give the adorable creature sitting next to me a series of headpats.“So just what are you doing in the capital, Emyu?” asked Leila.
“Watching the tournament, of course! This year’s tournament looks like it’s shaping up to be even more impressive than usual! One of the contestants blew away everyone else in his preliminary round with just a roar! It was so incredible! I couldn’t really get a good look at him because I was seated really far away, and because he had a mask on, but I’m sure he’s got to be someone amazing! I really respect him!”
“Uh huh…”I twitched a few times as I forced a smile. The girl’s eyes were sparkling. I wonder how she’d react if I told her that I was the guy under the mask the whole time. Heh.“Did you come all this way by yourself?”
“I did, but it’s okay! The old crow made me a couple talismans before sending me on my way.”Emyu rummaged through her robes, produced a series of paper tags, and showed them to her worried-sounding sister. I let my curiosity get the better of me and analyzed them immediately.***
Name: Talisman of Retaliation
Grade: A+
Description: This item will automatically initiate a counterattack that inflicts twice the amount of damage inflicted upon its bearer if its bearer is subject to an attack. This item is owned by Emyu. If any other individual attempts to touch it, they will be dealt a fatal wound.
***
Name: Talisman of Detection
Grade: A+
Description: This item automatically informs its bearer in the case that a hostile entity appears within a certain distance. This item is owned by Emyu. If any other individual attempts to touch it, they will be dealt a fatal wound.
***
Name: Scapegoat Talisman
Grade: A+
Description: This talisman nullifies up to three instances of fatal damage. This item is owned by Emyu. If any other individual attempts to touch it, they will be dealt a fatal wound.
***Wow. Uh, just, wow. Looking at her gear, I understood that it certainly was relatively safe for her to go out on a journey, even without a chaperone or guardian.“Seeing that you have the headmistress’ talismans certainly does give me peace of mind,” said Leila. “We will be staying in the castle for the next few days. If anything happens, make sure you look for us immediately.”
“The castle? Okay. Wait, the castle!? The castle that the king lives in!?”
“Precisely. My Lord is here in the capital at the king’s request, and as such we’ve been staying in his castle.”
“Y-Yuki’s important enough to be summoned by the king!?”
“Finally ready to see me in a different light?”I flashed a boyish grin, one she didn’t react well to. The sheep-horned child immediately humphed and turned to face away from me.“G-Getting summoned by the king doesn’t really mean all that much at all! It doesn’t change the fact that you’re not worthy of Leila! If you really want her, then you’ll have to get at least as strong as the guy with the mask!”
“Sounds tough,” I chuckled and played along as I took another bite out of a skewer of meat. “I guess I’ve gotta make sure I put more effort into my training.”Dinner continued to play out in a similar vein. We chatted and ate and ate and chatted the night away. Until we were interrupted, of course.“Hey Furrend! I didn’t think I would be seeing mew around here!”I turned in the direction that the familiar-sounding voice had come from—only to spot a pair of cat-like ears, ears that belonged to an adventurer we had shared a ride with.“Oh, hey Naiya. What’s up?” I asked. “And what happened to the two buddies you were with?”
“We’re taking a bit of a paws from work today so we can attend to our purrsonal business. We may be good friends, but that doesn’t mean we have to stick together litterally all the time.”Yeah, figures.“Did you ever end up going to the guild? I told the staff to let me know if a guy like mew ever showed up, but every time I asked, they said that they were absolutely pawsitive that they had never seen you, or any other guy with a kit.” She wrapped her arms around my neck and leaned into the back of my head as she spoke.Though a sweet, feminine scent wafted off her body, I managed to stay firm and unaffected by temptation. Naiya was like Lefi and Lyuu in the sense that she was about as flat as a board, so I had no problem keeping myself in check. I know what you’re thinking, but p l s. I’m not about to lose to temptation *every* time. Though I probably would’ve if she used her ears instead. Hnnng. Those ears. That’s why you gotta stop glaring at me like that, Enne! It’s okay! Just chill, I got this.As Naiya had mentioned it, my thoughts ended up drifting towards the demon realm’s adventurers’ guild. Honestly, it was a pretty nice place. The building was fairly large, and it had been bustling with noise and energy. But that was it. There was nothing special about it. It had been no different from any other client-facing government office. The humans’ guild had been so much more interesting than the demons’ that I ended up turning tail and leaving the moment I stepped into the latter.“Yeaahhh… I went, but I basically ended up ditching the moment I stepped inside. It was so plain and boring that I couldn’t stand it.”
“Fur real!? I can totally see mew doing just that!” She broke into a fit of hearty laughter. “It certainly is a bit of a bore. How about this, if you want to have fun? What do you say that mew and I spent some clawlity time alone together?”
“No! Bad!” Enne latched onto my arm before I could even reply.
“H-How dare you! You’re such a jerk! You can’t just cheat on Leila like that!” Next to speak was Emyu, whose face had turned as red as a tomato. Hahaha. She’s so innocent.
“That’s right, Master. You have me, too. No cheating. Bad.”
“Uhh… Enne, I’m pretty sure that doesn’t mean what you think it does. Because what you just said has some uh, crazy implications. Plus, this is all just a misunderstanding. I have no intention of being unfaithful.”“But you looked like you were going to grin,” protested Enne.
“N-Now hold up, I can tell you that is definitely not the case! At least not this time around!”Evidently, Naiya found the way I panicked hilarious, as she immediately broke into yet another roaring cackle.“It looks like you’re just as pawpular as usual, huh? You’ve got girls furmidably glaring at mew from all directions!”
“You say that, but this whole situation is entirely your fault.”I gave her a bit of an indignant stare before coughing and bringing the conversation back on track.“Right, anyway, sorry. I really appreciate the invitation, but I don’t really have the time for anything like that. And I’d probably still say no even if I did. My wife would literally murder me if she ever found out, and she’s got an abnormally sharp nose, so she’ll find out right away.”
“Aww, that’s too bad. Oh well, you can furget about it. It was just a joke anyway, since I don’t really have all that time on my paws either.”
“…Can you not? That kinda joke’ll end up getting me lynched one day.”
“Nope! Teasing mew is really fun, Yuki. The way mew react is always just hissterical!”I’m pretty sure that’s the first time anyone’s ever told me that… That can’t be right. Can it…?“No. Bad Naiya. I won’t give you Master.”
“That’s too bad,” she said with a laugh. “Well, I’ve really gotta go now! See ya later, Catanova!”The cat girl let go of my neck, gave Enne a couple pats on the head, and winked at me one last time before vanishing into the crowd.“Man… that chick came and went like a friggin’ storm.” I said.
“She certainly does do wonders for the mood. The atmosphere appears much more relaxing with her around,” said Leila.
“Uhhhh… relaxing? Really…? ‘Cause I’m pretty sure that isn’t what I’d call that.”
“Geez, Master. You always cheat. Right when I take my eyes off you,” said Enne.
“What an unfaithful man!” shouted Emyu. “I knew demon lords were driven by their loins! There’s no way I could possibly leave Leila in the hands of a sex offender like him!”
“You guys have given me so much to say that I don’t even know where I’m supposed to start,” I grumbled. “But most importantly, dinner’s going to get cold if you guys spend all your time chatting, so how about we focus on that for now?”Once we finished our meal, we escorted Leila’s sister back to the inn she was staying at and said our goodbyes. At that particular moment, I had no idea that she and I would end up reuniting at the most unexpected of times.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Retainer’s Tale
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerDarkness had descended upon the city. The sun had long hidden itself away beneath the horizon and left the moon in its place. Try as it would, the moon simply couldn’t provide the world beneath it with the sun’s energy or radiance.While the lack of light was certainly a contributing factor, it was not the only reason that the command centre was so hard to spot. The fiends had intentionally constructed it in a manner that would keep it out of sight; it was sandwiched between a series of larger buildings and designed to be as inconspicuous as any secret hideout should. And yet, it had been discovered.“T-there are four in total, two by the door, and two standing by on the roof.” One of the three individuals staring down the building’s entrance nervously stuttered out a report. A glance was all that was needed to know that she, Vische, was the most inexperienced of the bunch, for though they stood in front of her, both her companions were far less conspicuous.The first almost seemed to be one with the night itself. Though he stood out in the open, he was effectively impossible to see. The other was a little more cautious. He made sure to move from shadow to shadow as he slowly crept towards his destination. Vische was nowhere near as skilled as either. Still, it wasn’t as if she was simply standing out in the open either. She managed to keep out of sight despite being as flustered as could be.“I can take care of the two on the roof. Can I trust you two to eliminate the others?”
“Certainly, captain,” the man who had been slinking around in the shadows turned to address the team’s newest member immediately after acknowledging his orders. “You stay here and keep watch, Vische. I’ll take care of the bottom two myself.”
“R-Roger that.”
“Calm down. Vische. You’ll be okay,” said the shadow slinker. “You’ve gone through more than enough training to handle this. And even if you haven’t, the captain and I have got your back. You really don’t need to be so nervous.”
“How am I supposed to do that!?” said Vische indignantly. She made sure to keep her voice as quiet as she could in order to ensure that they weren’t discovered.
“It’ll be a breeze, Vische. Calm down,” said the captain. “Now let’s get started.”The night itself almost seemed to shudder as he vanished, only to reappear on the roof as the two guards standing on top of it collapsed. Their execution had been as silent as it was instant. Not a single sound was made as they met their untimely demise.Vische’s other companion followed their captain’s lead and also leapt into action. He dashed straight at the two guards standing out front and slit the first’s throat before jabbing his dagger into the second’s heart.Unlike the captain, he wasn’t able to perform perfect, silent kills. Each of the two men groaned as their lives ended, but he at least managed to catch them before they hit the ground, eliminating the sound that would have accompanied their collapse.“They really never fail to impress…” said Vische to no one in particular.
“How are the enemies inside looking?” The man on the roof leapt back down onto the ground as he posed the question.
“G-give me a second.”Vische closed her eyes and took a breath before reopening them and staring fixedly at the building before them.“There are… 16 of them in total. They haven’t noticed us just yet, but they’re on high alert.”
“I suppose they would be. We have been raiding their bases quite often as of late. Where are they positioned?”
“Three of them are in the security station situated right next to the door. There are four more in a room at the end of the hallway. There’s only one on the second floor. He’s sleeping in one of the back rooms. The basement has another seven, with four in the room right by the stairs, and three in the room furthest away.”
“There’s a lot of ‘em. Captain, what do you think?” The dagger wielder frowned as he turned to his boss for advice.
“It’s fine. They’re too spread out to be a threat. I’ll be going in by myself. Keep Vische safe while I’m gone.”
“You sure, Captain?”
“Don’t worry. It’s all just another day’s work. I’ll be back in an instant.” He almost seemed to melt into the night and vanish, leaving only his words behind.
“I-I know I say this almost every time I see it, but the captain’s spells sure are impressive,” said Vische.
“Yes, yes they are. You can easily see why they call him the king’s right hand man.” replied the dagger-wielder. “To the fiends, he’s no different from a walking nightmare. If he shows up at their door, then they’re dead for good. There’s nothing they can do to end his rampage, and nothing they can do to stop him from showing up. The worst part is that they’ll be dead before they even realize they’re under attack. The only choice they have is to tremble in their boots until it’s suddenly all over.”
“I-I’m just glad he’s on our side.”
“Me too, Vische. Me too.”There wasn’t really much more to be said, so the pair ended up idling in front of the building until the door eventually creaked open. The man immediately brandished his dagger and got ready for a fight, but lowered it as quickly as he had raised it once he realized that the individual exiting the building was none other than the captain they had been discussing a few minutes prior.“That was a quick cleanup, captain,” he said.
“G-good work out there, captain!” said Vische.
“Thank you. They weren’t very impressive. This base’s staff was mainly comprised of thugs,” he said. “That about wraps things up. Let’s go.”
”W-what about the corpses?” asked Vische quietly.The captain touched one of the nearby bodies the moment Vische opened her mouth. The moment he did, it disappeared entirely. All the blood and evidence that accompanied the murder vanished without a trace.“I’m sorry Vische, I didn’t catch that. What were you saying?”
“U-uhm, it was nothing, Captain, nothing at all.”
“Great. Alright you two, let’s head on back to base.”***A giggle entered Haloria’s ears as she lay upon her bed. While it wasn’t anything she found unnatural, it certainly wasn’t something that she heard every day. Curiosity got the better of her, but she was far too tired to turn onto her side, so she craned her head and looked at her roommate-cum-coworker.“You certainly seem to be in a good mood today.”
“Is it really that obvious?” asked Vische, with another giggle.
“Of course. Just how long do you think the two of us have known each other?” Haloria smiled. “So? What happened.”
“See for yourself!”Vische thrusted the parchment she was holding onto in the other girl’s direction. At first glance, it didn’t appear to be any sort of important document. In fact, it was likely the opposite. The only thing on the page was a sort of bizarre scribble.“What’s that supposed to be?”
“It’s an autograph! I got it from the guy with the mask, the one our king hired!”Like Haloria, Vische was a part of the secret service. Her function was to fulfill the king’s will and enact it throughout the demon realm. That said, unlike many of the other members, Vische wasn’t exactly what one could call talented when it came to the art of espionage. She wasn’t particularly powerful. Her talents lay not in sheer numbers, but rather in the rare special ability she possessed. It was a unique skill, one called Farsight.Effectively speaking, Farsight was a combination of clairvoyance and truesight. It allowed her to perceive any sort of information she wished to see. To Vische, walls were irrelevant. She could even perceive the quality and quantity of one’s mana.And for that, King Phynar had recognized her abilities. He had immediately hired her, put her through the wringer, and paired her with his most trusted retainers. As she had recently completed the last of her formal training, she had finally been sent on missions. She had even participated in an attack on an important enemy base.Using a larger amount of magical energy made it easy for Vische to identify enemies, even within a crowd. As such, the king had tasked her with exactly that. She had disguised herself as a member of Destia Trome’s staff and used her position to identify all of their foes.That was why she had ended up witnessing the masked man’s battles. And, ultimately speaking, that was why she had found herself completely captivated. He was powerful, truly and immensely powerful. She fully understood why King Phynar had gone out of his way to request his assistance.The way he flaunted his power was flamboyant. His actions were so needlessly exaggerated that she felt the need to label him ostentatious. He intentionally took a hit just so he could demonstrate how much stronger he was than his opponent. And that wasn’t all. He had insulted said opponent further by stepping all over his face before taunting the audience. It was ridiculous. He conducted himself in a manner befitting an incorrigible villain.And yet, she still found herself fascinated. Because she understood. That wasn’t who he really was. It was intentional. It was all an act, an act so brilliant, so intentionally well crafted that she considered it a work of art. She was so enthralled by his performance that she couldn’t help but ask for his autograph the moment it was her turn to serve as his guide.“Uhm… good for you, I guess,” said Haloria in a bit of a confused tone.
“It really is!” Vische grinned. “You worked with him directly, right? What was he like?”
“Hmm… well… I believe the best way to describe him would be to call him an eccentric.”
“E-Eccentric? Why’s that?”
“Everything he did was so bizarre and abnormal that I am not sure how else to describe him.” Haloria shrugged. “He was exactly what our king was looking for in the sense that he was truly capable of attracting a copious amount of attention.”The exhaustion that accompanied Haloria’s description led Vische to chuckle. Thinking back, she realized that he certainly was exactly as she described. She understood that the man who fought in the arena was not truly the man behind the mask. Still, she felt as if he was a far cry from the norm. He was simply different.“Though, there was one other thing I noticed,” said Haloria. “Being around him was strangely comforting. I’m not quite sure why, but being in his company felt as if it was enough to put me at ease.”
“Oh, I know what you mean!” said Vische. “I think that’s just a property of his magical energy. It’s really calming, and it was radiating off of him the whole time.”Looking at him with Farsight had informed Vische that the man behind the mask wasn’t nearly as exaggerated and aggressive as his battles had implied. The aura that stemmed from his body was much more soothing than it was aggressive and showy. Though the amount of magic he had was ridiculous, seeing it hadn’t intimidated her. In fact, it had the exact opposite effect. His mana was so warm and mellow that she had felt the urge to continue gazing into it for as long as she could.Farsight told no falsehoods. The only thing it relayed to her was the undeniable truth. The essence that made up his being was one of positivity. Her understanding of that side of him was the only reason a girl as timid as herself was able to approach him without recoiling in terror.“I suppose that must be the case if you’re the one saying it,” said Haloria. “I think that is enough chatting for one night. We both have to get up early tomorrow, and we’re far too overworked to waste what little time we have to rest.”
“Right. Good night, Haloria.”
“Good night, Vische.With a smile on her face, Vische put out the candle illuminating the room and allowed herself to drift off into the land of dreams.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Sinister Summit
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“You lied to me!” An angry voice roared throughout the conference room as its owner, a young male wingbearer, smashed his fist against the table. “Nothing went according to your plans!”Wingbearers were typically considered difficult to read given the avian nature of their visages. This one, however, wasn’t. His fury and indignance were as evident as the feathers that covered his body.“You told me that it would be a simple operation! You were supposed to erase everyone that had gone senile and instate me as the leader of my people! You told me that it would be easy, but look at you now! A failure! My newfound title is worthless! If I were a tiger, I would be made of paper. And if I were a wolf, I would be all bark and no bite! All of my remaining tribesmen have gone and not only escaped, but joined forces with our enemies! This is not what we agreed on. You lied to me, Nagutt!”
“You’re calling me a liar? You’ve taken the words right out of my mouth.” A man dressed from head to toe in black, responded with a scoff.
“Nonsense!”
“Nonsense? Your report stated that the wingbearers’ only allies were a group of weak, insignificant humans. Did it not cross your mind that a hero would be worth mentioning? You failed to so much as warn us. It’s only natural that we were unprepared. To make matters worse, you didn’t even so much as try to investigate her allegiances. The hero’s efforts and the masked man’s interference cost me half my subordinates.” The tone Nagutt spoke with made him sound calm, but he was far from it. His gaze burned with a righteous fury. Even with his murderous glare aside, his point was clear. He was blaming the wingbearer, faulting him for the numerous deaths his incompetence had derived.“That was entirely their own fault! They wouldn’t have died if they were any less pathetic!”
“You’re a fool, an ignorant child incapable of comprehending the world around him,” said Nagutt, coldly. “Your eyes are so useless that you may as well remove them.”
“How dare you!?” The bird man toppled over a chair as rose to his feet in a display of indignance.
“See? His actions are every bit as childish as I described,” said the man in black with a look of scorn.
“Cease your bickering immediately, both of you.” It appeared that the situation was likely to rapidly degenerate, so a third man, Derrivus, stepped into the conversation. And put a prompt end to the conversation. “Do you not realize that you are before the chief?”Derrivus’ voice carried a hint of anger. As the chief’s aide, he had no intention of allowing his men to humiliate themselves before their idol. And as neither of the two wished to incur his wrath, they both responded favorably. The man in black bowed his head submissively, while the wingbearer begrudgingly propped his chair back up and returned to his seat after twisting his beak in frustration.“I believe returning to our previous topic of discussion is in order,” said Derrivus. “Nagutt, how are your forces faring?”
“I’ve lost too many men. I suspect we will be unable to do anything beyond reconnaissance.”
“And what of the hero?”
“We couldn’t find her corpse, so I suspect she escaped. We assume that the man in the mask had come to her rescue.”Derrivus stopped to contemplate the possibilities as opposed to replying immediately. And as such, another individual used the opportunity to step in and have one of their questions addressed.“There is just one thing I want to ask you.” The voice was quiet, and as it was muffled by the jet black suit of full metal armour that the speaker was covered in, it was impossible to discern its owner’s sex. Likewise, their mannerisms were equally hard to read. They had remained silent with their arms crossed throughout the conference. “Is this mysterious masked man truly as strong as you’ve made him sound?”
“He is,” said Derrivus confidently. “He single-handedly eliminated half of Nagutt’s black ops team and was able to match our chief in a contest of strength the very next day.”
“Excellent,” chuckled the suit of armour.
“You really don’t ever change.” The chief’s aide put on a bit of a sardonic smile before turning to another individual seated at the table. “Have your investigations borne any fruit?”
“We were unable to pinpoint his identity, but we have at least narrowed it down. It seems that he is most likely one of four individuals.”
“Elaborate.”The head of the investigations took a deep breath before heeding Derrivus’ order and explaining his findings. “Our first candidate is one of the king’s most well known operatives, Lunogill, the Silent Assassin. While there certainly can be an argument made for his identity, we lacked the evidence to conclude that it was him, so we began expanding our list. As we did, we realized that Shanadia, the blademaster sworn to Phynar’s demihuman allies, and the dragonewt warrior in his service, J’nadelle, both appeared equally likely. Our final candidate is a dungeon master named Yuki. Unfortunately, we were unable to procure evidence that affirmed any of our suspicions regardless of the candidate.”
“I see your point. The Silent Assassin, the Blademaster, and the warrior certainly all do appear as likely candidates.” Derrivus furrowed his brows. “There is one name that I am not familiar with. Who is this… Yuki?”
“He is the demon lord that interfered with our plot to seal Allysia’s fate. He is known for wearing masks and making use of a long, sword-like weapon. Truth be told, he is the least likely of our candidates.”
“And why is that? Your description of him perfectly matches the description of the man our chief fought.”
“Yuki is a demon lord. He rules a labyrinth, a dungeon. Dungeon masters are tied to their cores, and they must defend them at all costs. If that alone is not enough to convince you that he is the least likely candidate, then I would like to make mention of his dungeon’s location. It lies deep within the Wicked Forest’s depths.”
“…So it lays near where the legendary Supreme Dragon annihilated our black-scaled ally?” He smiled bitterly; his expression almost seemed to reek of distaste.
“The Wicked Forest’s inner sanctum is a dangerous place, and it would still be one even without the Supreme Dragon’s presence. The monsters that inhabit it are 2 to 3 times more powerful than those that do not. I sent several of my best men to investigate the area, but not a single one of them has ever returned. I believe it’s safe to conclude that he has no intention of leaving the area given that his core is in a perpetual state of danger.”
“That appears contradictory. Did you not just say that he was in Allysia?”
“With all due respect sir, I would like to remind you of the fact that the Wicked Forest is far closer to the Allysian Kingdom than it is the Demon Realm. Our grasp on his abilities appears to indicate that he would be able to make his way to the kingdom in a matter of hours. Travelling to the demon realm, however, would require him several days of effort. And that, sir, does not even account for the extended stay that would have to accompany participating in the event.”
“I certainly do see your point. It simply would not make sense for the lord of a labyrinth to abandon his domain,” Derrivus muttered. “His identity aside, the man behind the mask is sure to become a major obstacle. Let us exercise due diligence and further our efforts t—”
“Leave him be.”The aide’s words were refuted by none other than the very master he served. Gojim, who had silently remained in the seat of honour with his face propped up by a fist, had finally spoken.While Phynar certainly did know a lot about the fiends, there was one thing that he had been wrong about. While Gojim’s subordinates certainly did do their best to follow his orders to the letter, they did know how to think for themselves. Carrying out the chief’s orders was a rare occasion to all.Gojim was a figurehead, but not one that went unrespected. To those that served him, his words were their will. But he gave so few orders that they were essentially left to their own devices. For Gojim, the average day consisted of allowing his subordinates to do whatever they pleased. The only time he ever made important decisions was when he absolutely had to, like when the man in the mask had pressured him into a public duel.It wasn’t as if he was irresponsible. In fact, it was exactly the opposite. Gojim understood that fighting was all he was good at. The only thing he could possibly do for his people was stand as their champion in combat. Needlessly sticking his nose into his subordinates’ realms of expertise would do nothing but hinder them and worsen the end result. That was why the chief did nothing, nothing but sit around, wait for his subordinates to report to him, and bear the weight of their actions on his shoulders.He played his role as chief well. The charismatic aura he carried was so powerful and domineering that others naturally flocked to him and sought to be placed under his wing.“A-are you sure, chief?” stuttered Derrivus.
“He’s already retreated from the public eye. I doubt he will be bothering us for some time to come,” said Gojim. “We have more important things to do than digging up his whereabouts. He’s sure to show up on his own in due time. We may as well set him aside until it’s absolutely necessary that he be dealt with.”
“…If that is your will.” Derrivus didn’t look happy with the decision, but he acknowledged his orders and accepted them. “Is there anything else you wanted to say, chief?”
“I suppose I did want to say one thing.” The lord of the fiends spoke in a slow, deliberate manner. “Our plans have been inhibited. We had thought of Destia Trome as an opportunity. And yet, we found ourselves weaker than we were before it. Phynar has attacked our fortresses and raided our facilities. We have been able to do nothing to stop him. Our plans are in need of revision. It is necessary that we carefully scrutinize each and determine its value. Do not overlook anything. Consider every fundamental aspect.”The entire room was silent. Every individual present was listening to Gojim’s speech with full attention.“The obstacle in our path is but trivial in the face of our goals. Nothing has changed. We will continue to follow our creed. We must.”His words were soft, but heavy. He spoke quietly, but each word dripped with passion as thick as honey; the fervor that drove him spread throughout the conference room and ensnared those that heard his voice. None could stay calm. Each individual’s chest was soon filled with passion.“For those who have fallen, we must not stop. We must never stop. It is our duty to carry out their will and see our ambitions through. We must march on. For conquest.”
“For conquest!”Voices echoed through the room as every individual repeated the chief’s final words. The situation had appeared to indicate that they were at an all time low. And yet, their hearts soared as high as the sky. Because they knew. It was time to work. It was time for them to exhaust every last fibre of their beings in order to achieve the goal—the dream—that they had always chased.<– Prev — Next –>

A Decision Made Without My Consent — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe feeling that came over me as my body was deconstructed was bizarre to say the least. I was still conscious even after being disassembled; I was well aware of the fact that everything had gone dark. A few moments later, I experienced the exact opposite sensation. My body was rebuilt from the ground up. My eyes regained their function, albeit gradually, to reveal that I had returned to the true throne room. My trip to the demon realm had become a thing of the past.I wasn’t using my own warp crystal. Mine had ultimately ended up in Nell’s hands as a result of a series of poorly timed coincidences. Fortunately, we had a spare. Enne didn’t need one in weapon form, so I had her assume it, borrowed her handy-dandy teleportation device, and beamed the both of us right back to the dungeon.“Oh my…” My companion, Leila, voiced her surprise right as my eyes finished adjusting. She was well justified in doing so. The first thing we had perceived upon our return was the hero.The half-naked hero.She had gone stiff. Witnessing us warp in had left her so surprised that she had effectively ended up freezing in time. Well then… Looks like someone was in the middle of grabbing a change of clothes.Our timing was bad, but it wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been. She was, at the very least, not fully naked; her bottom was covered by a pair of pajamas. The same, however, couldn’t be said for her top. The only thing that was hiding her chest from sight was the arm she had held in front of it. Her skin, tanned by the sun, almost seemed to glow under the dungeon’s artificial lights. Wait, I recognize those PJs. I’m pretty sure they’re Lyuu’s.“…”The only thing that followed Leila’s comment was silence. Neither I or any of the girls spoke. We simply stood where we were and engaged in a long, uncomfortable staring contest. Well then. This is awkward. I should probably say something. Yeah, that’d probably help break the ice.Though I tried, attempting to speak didn’t work out, at least not at first. My first few attempts did nothing but make me look like I was trying to mime a goldfish. My brain had yet to finish processing the situation at hand; it was stuck in a loop. A good mental kick or two managed to remedy the problem, however, as I eventually managed to drop the fish act and squeeze out a greeting.“You know, it’s kinda hard to tell when you’ve actually got clothes on, but you’ve got a pretty nice pair of tits.”
“Stop staring at me already, you pervert!”I was about to say something snarky, something along the lines of ‘Pervert? Where? What pervert?’ but sadly, I didn’t end up having the chance. My expression had apparently revealed my intentions, as my face soon found itself greeted by her fist.The sudden sucker punch caught me completely off guard and almost immediately robbed me of my consciousness. The last thing I remembered before passing out was groaning as I flew into one of the dungeon’s walls. Shit… I probably… shouldn’t have… said that…***“I trust you understand the reason for which I have demanded your repentance?”Upon regaining consciousness, my swollen face and I soon found ourselves in the middle of the hall that was the true throne room. Lefi had demanded that I sit in front of her with my knees forward, my back straight, and my legs tucked under my butt. It was a traditional, Japanese pose, one that often signified either repentance or discipline. And in this case, it was apparently supposed to be the former.I had to comply. The dragon girl wasn’t happy. She seemed to be exuding an imposing, domineering aura, one that served to indicate that she would not be taking ‘no’ for an answer under any circumstances whatsoever. She wasn’t the only one either. Illuna had done her best to emulate the dragon’s pose and aura, as she too stood before me with her arms crossed. To her other side was Nell, who, like the others, was far from happy and continued to flash me angry glares one after another. That said, unlike the other two, she seemed to be feeling a mix of emotions; her cheeks were still tinged a shade of red from the incident. Is it just me, or has this been happening a lot lately? I swear, everyone keeps making everything out to be my fault even though it really isn’t. What the hell, man, what the hell…?“I believe it has something to do with the lady giving me the death stare, your honour.” Lefi was effectively acting the part of a judge, so I decided to play along and speak in a tone much more polite than my usual one.
“I am pleased to know that you do not remain utterly unaware of your misdemeanours. Now speak, confess the precise details of your sin!”
“I’m sorry, your honour. The issue was that I happened to see her naked.”
“Geez, Yuki, I know it was an accident, but you could’ve at least been a bit more considerate!” Nell immediately began complaining about my supposed lack of delicacy.
“You are mistaken. I would not have demanded an apology for a matter so trivial.”
“Yeah, Yuki! You heard her! You better be mo—wait, what?”Lefi’s response caught Nell completely off guard. The hero ended up cutting her own lecture short with a double-take the moment she finally realized that the two of them weren’t on the same page.“My anger stems from the manner in which you have dealt with the opposite sex. It appalls me to know that you have invited yet another woman into your abode. And that is but merely half my complaint! I have been informed by both Leila and Enne that you remained completely unreserved in your interactions with other women. You continued to seduce them despite my explicit warnings. I cannot believe you! What part of my instructions have you failed to understand!?”
“O-oh, that’s what you meant… She’s still right, Yuki! You heard her! What’s wrong with yo—wait a second! Did she just imply I was seduced!?”Again, Nell hopped on board and began admonishing me, only to do a double-take the moment she realized that her thoughts differed from the dragon’s. Oh Nell, you derpy little thing.“Why do you laugh, Yuki? Do you not understand that I have ordered you to reflect upon your actions?”
“I’m sorry, ‘your honour,’ I’ll totally ‘carry out my sentence’ or whatever. But first, I’ve got something I need to say.” I kept up the whole judge facade, but reverted to my usual, overly-casual tone. I even threw in a bit of sarcasm, just ‘cause.
“And what would that be?”
“So, I’ve kinda got absolutely no memory of doing any of the stuff you’re accusing me of. Iunno what you’ve heard, but I’m totally innocent.”
“Hah!” She snorted. “A more brazen lie, I’ve never heard. Enne, I call you to the stage. Provide your testimony at once!”
“Mmk…” The sword girl standing behind Lefi, stepped forward.She wasn’t really what I would call easy to read. Her expression basically never changed. But as of late, I had become capable of discerning the subtle differences between her various emotions. That was why I could tell that, for one reason or another, she didn’t exactly seem all that happy. In fact, she was very much like the others in the sense that she too was looking at me like I was some sort of criminal.“Master was smitten by the girl with cat ears. And the demon with the big chest.”Big chest? Oh, she must mean the Rouinne chick we met on the coach. It didn’t take me much effort to recall the girl in question. Unlike most of the other people I’d met, she was memorable, in part because of her shapely figure, and in part because she was the type to wear a good bit less than she probably should.“Behold! A witness present at the scene of the crime speaks against you!” said Lefi. “There is little more for you to say in the face of such solid evidence!”
“Yeah! There’s no way you could possibly talk your way outta this one!” Again, Illuna mimicked Lefi; she too raised a hand as if making a declaration. Awwwww. That’s adorable. What a cutie pie.“L-Look, I know things are looking pretty bad for me, but just listen. I can explain,” I said. “You see, that’s just how Enne saw things. It wasn’t how they really were. The truth is that I’m totally innocent. The whole cat girl thing was driven by curiosity since I’d never seen anything like her before. And I wasn’t into the girl with tits either!” Of course, a part of my lack of interest had stemmed from Enne herself. My trusty sword had always made sure to butt in before I lost control. Like damn, she’s so good at shutting people down that she’d put Gori to shame. Hell, she could probably even deny his signature Gorilla Dunk pretty easily if she felt like it.“Mmrphh…” Enne groaned in dissatisfaction. “Bad master. No lying.”
“Oh come on. I’m not lying. You just had it all wrong. Like come on, why would I go girl hunting when every bit of love I have to spare is already being eaten up by you girls? We are family, after all. Besides, I’m already married to the best girl this world has to offer. There’s no reason for me to ever bother going after anyone else.”
“I-I suppose that certainly is the case.”
“Wow! Thanks! I love you too, Yuki!” giggled Illuna.
“Mhm. Me too,” agreed Enne.Going on the offensive worked. Illuna and Enne were both struck by a sudden burst of embarrassment. Lefi had it even worse. She blushed as she began to stammer and trip over her own words.“W-wait, girls, stop! Don’t let him trick you! He’s just trying to distract you and make you forget why you were mad at him!” Unfortunately, the individual I had failed to include in my appeal had caught onto my plans. Argghhh, I was so close! Damn you, hero! Curse you and your ability to foil my carefully constructed plans! I bet it’s just cause I’m a demon lord!“W-whatever the case, you must endeavour to revise your attitude!” stuttered Lefi. “Y-you must be more careful in your treatment of the opposite sex!”
“Sure thing, wifey. Will do.” I zoned Lefi’s lecture out and started casually nodding along as she spoke.
“And as you are my h-husband, it is imperative that you act the part. You must always carry yourself in a manner befitting that of the Supreme Dragon’s mate should you leave our lair!”
“Aye aye, wifey. Orders received.”
“It pleases me to know that you are willing to abide by my commands. I would not mind putting an end to your admonishment so long as you do not forget what I have said to you today.”
“Roger that, wifey. I got it.”
“Excellent,” said Lefi with a smile. “Then I suppose I have no qualms with you claiming another bride. Very well. I permit you to take Nell as one of your mates.”
“Thanks, wifey. I’m glad you’re so understa—”………Wait.What?<– Prev — Next –>

A Decision Made Without My Consent — Part 2
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“W-where the heck did that come from!?” Nell opened her eyes wide in shock as she squeaked like a mouse. Evidently, I wasn’t the only one caught off guard by Lefi’s irrational declaration.
“You need not act so surprised. I am well aware of your desires.”
“I-I know you are, but that came out of nowhere! You could’ve at least told me you were going to bring it up!”The only response the dragon offered the panicked hero was an exasperated sigh. And here I was thinking they were on the same page.“Wait, Lefi, hold up. What the hell’s all this about? Mind explaining?” I placed a hand on the side of my head and massaged one of my temples as I reentered the conversation.
“What is it that you need me to explain?” Lefi frowned in confusion as she looked down at me. “Was wedding her not your intention? I see no other reason for you to have brought her here.”
“Look, I’m pretty scummy, but I’m not so scummy that I’d go hunting for more women before I even take my wife out on a honeymoon,” I said. “I didn’t warp her here because I wanted to marry her. She just happened to collapse right as I got myself into a fight, so I sent her away in order to make sure she didn’t end up getting caught in the crossfire.”
“Were your foes powerful enough to merit such an extreme measure?”
“Nah, they were pretty weak,” I said. “But it seemed like she was probably going to jump right back into the fray the moment she woke up. That kinda didn’t really seem like the best idea considering how tired she was, so I did her a favour and kept her away from all the action.”Potions weren’t cure-alls. They couldn’t relieve exhaustion. And Nell had accumulated a lot of exhaustion. The fight she had been engaged in had left her with such a massive stamina deficit that I suspected she probably wouldn’t have been able to reasonably accomplish anything beyond lying in bed for a few days. Reasonably.If there was one thing I knew about the hero, it was that she was anything but reasonable. Her devotion to her cause bordered the line of absurdity. There was simply no way a mere wave of crippling fatigue or two could keep her in bed. And that was precisely the problem. Nell wouldn’t have abided by her limits. She would have pushed forward and returned to the wingbearers’ village and save all that remained. Even in spite of her body’s need for rest. It would have been a literal death march, but she would have gone anyway.Because that was what it meant to be a hero.That was what it meant to be Nell.“S-so sending me here was all for me? W-wow. So you really do care…” The hero began to fidget as her face flushed. Stop that. Stop blushing. And stop staring at me all embarrassed-like. You’re starting to make me feel real uncomfortable right about now.
“Uhhhh suuuuuuure.” I averted my eyes away from the hero’s passionate gaze and turned back towards my wife. “Anyway, so like I was saying, I only had her sent here ‘cause shit happened. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less.”
“But was it not an action you performed only after accepting her love for you? I was informed that your heroic rescue deepened her love for you to such an extent that she chose to profess her affections immediately.”
“W-w-whaaaahhh!? D-did you really have to tell him that!? I totally asked you to keep it a secret!” screamed Nell.
“Nell’s just like Lefi! She loves you a whole lot!” said Illuna.
“Not you too Illuna!”Uhhhhhhh… I… uh… uhhhhh… Yeah, uhhh shit. I don’t know what I’m supposed to say. Or do. Or think. Or feel. Like, shit. I actually have no idea, I’m totally stumped. Hey, Sh*nji, dude, you listening? Er, well, I guess you probably are with that whole god thing you have going on. Anyway, I know you’d know what to do at a time like this. Mind giving a bro a couple tips?…Alright, you know what, that’s about enough escapism for one day. Fuck it. Time to man up and face reality.I took a deep breath as I reflected on my memories. Thinking back, I probably would’ve seen this coming if I was paying more attention to her right before she passed out. Hell, I probably should’ve seen it coming from a mile away even if I didn’t. I always used to bitch, moan, and complain at dense protagonists who didn’t notice when people made moves on ‘em, you know, ‘cause of how obvious it was, but I kinda totally just pulled the exact same thing myself. Fuck, dude, I feel dumb as shit. I honestly have nothing to say for myself. That was all on me.Er, well, actually, on second thought, I do have one pretty decent excuse. I was pretty pissed back then. I was doing my best not to let it show, but shit, I was mad. Like M A D. Can’t really blame me for being too preoccupied to process what she said, can you?…Alright, fine. You totally can. Shut up. I know I’m an idiot.While both Nell and I had been caught completely off guard, our reactions weren’t by any means parallel. My expression indicated that I was just plain old surprised. Hers, on the other hand, pointed to something more akin to embarrassment.“W-why did you have to tell him!?” The hero was so flustered by the other girls’ betrayal that she burst out of the throne room and dashed down the hallway with her eyes filled with tears.
“Oopsie…” said Illuna. “I think we might’ve made her mad.”
“You need not worry. She is not angry, she was merely incapable of containing her embarrassment.”
“Sooo uh…” I turned to face Lefi again after watching the hero dash off. “I mean, I kinda get what you were going on about, but I also really don’t. Like, Iunno. It just doesn’t make sense. Why, exactly, do you want me to marry her?”
“We spoke at length,” said Lefi. “The conclusion I reached from our interactions is that I would not mind you taking her as a mate. I appreciate her. The time that we spent in both your and Leila’s absence left us without any skilled cooks.”Her voice grew quiet, and her words began to slow. Even the fiery light that normally blazed within the silver-haired maiden’s eyes dimmed as she elaborated.“It was a dark time, one that taught us the true value of a well-prepared meal. It was she who, as a skilled artist in the culinary arts, rescued us from the abyss.”The combination of her tone and expression was peculiar. Her aura almost seemed to resemble that of a sagely monk recalling the traumatic event that had landed him his permanent reservation in the psychiatric ward. So you’re telling me that this whole approval thing is predicated on your friggin’ stomach? Seriously…? Er, now that I think about it, they have always said that conquering one’s stomach is no different from conquering their heart. Wait. Waiiiiit. What exactly was Lefi eating before she started living in the dungeon, anyway? And, hold up, why the hell were they so starved anyway? I could’ve sworn I’d left them all my recipes. And that’s on top of a literal fridge-full of ready-to-eat meals.“Alright, let’s hit the brakes on the whole Nell topic for a moment. There’s something more important I want addressed first. Has Illuna been eating properly? Or have you just been feeding her whatever?”None of the dungeon’s monster girls needed to eat. All Shii, the wraith girls, and our pets required to sustain themselves was the dungeon’s mana. To them, filling their bellies was naught but leisure. Illuna, on the other hand, would die if she didn’t get the right balance of nutrients. The same applied to Lefi and Lyuu, but I didn’t really care what they ate. If they even ate at all. Unlike Illuna, they weren’t in the middle of growing up. Neither was as likely to suffer dire consequences from malnutrition.“Y-you need not be so concerned.” My tone had left Lefi intimidated; her reply came with a stammer. “The meals we produced certainly could not be labelled as delectable, but they were far from utterly inedible. Moreover, our kitchen adventures were rather few in number. The dishes you prepared lasted a full week.”
“Yeah! Things were looking really bad at first, but then we fixed it! We all worked together, did our best, and got a lot better at cooking!” The vampire’s chest puffed up with pride as she spoke.
“Did you really…?”
“Yup! Really! I’ve gotten so good that I bet I can make something that’ll totally blow you away!” said Illuna. “I can’t wait to teach Enne everything I learned and get her up to speed!”
“Sounds great. I’m looking forward to trying it.” I smiled at her before turning back towards Lefi. “Alright, it seems like that’s that, so let’s get back to talking about the other thing. Are you really sure you’re okay with me taking more wives? ‘Cause to me, that pretty much sounds like a pretty big red flag.”
“It would be impossible for me to state, without lying, that I think nothing of it. I would be very angry if you were to become completely unfaithful, and I do not wish for you to indulge in infidelity. Still, I do not mind you taking more mates,” she said. “While you have yet to reach my pedestal, you remain far beyond the norm. To any other, you are a storm, an unstoppable, almighty force of nature that bears power overwhelming. I expect nothing but for women to swarm to your side. Because that is this world’s way.”She turned away from me and looked out the door as she continued.“It is normal behaviour, even amongst dragons, for women to flock to men of great power. The opposite is also true. Men often attempt to court their mates with brute force. It is an experience I know well. Many have endeavoured to woo me with their might,” she sighed as she grumbled. “And each was shown that they deserve nothing but to grovel at my feet.”Her words were striking. They once again forced me to understand that I wasn’t one of this world’s natives. That my values were different. But that didn’t mean I was unwilling to adapt. I understood, and accepted, everything she said as fact.Unlike modern-day Japan, this world was one in which only the fittest survived. It made sense, even for those outside the demon realm, to value strength. Because it, polygamy, was a survival strategy. Breeding with powerful individuals was a good way to bolster the survival rates of one’s offspring, one’s genes. And that was the exact task most living things were hardwired to try to accomplish.I turned away from the woman who had ended up being surprisingly supportive of me taking more brides despite always grumbling about the fact that I needed to be less of a flirt, and instead redirected my gaze in Illuna’s direction.“W-what do you think, Illuna? Aren’t you going to object to any of this at all?” The vampire was extremely attached to me, so I assumed that she would have something to say about me not having as much time for her.
“Not really!” But apparently, I was wrong. “You already promised that you were going to let me, Enne, Shii, Rei, Rui, and Lowe all marry you once we get bigger too, so I don’t mind at all!”
“…”Fuck.I was stunned into silence. I remembered that they had made the request shortly after I had gotten married to Lefi, and I certainly did remember more or less nodding along and telling them to wait until they got older because I had expected their feelings to change by the time they became full-fledged adults. Shit. She isn’t wrong. I did already technically agree to the whole polygamy thing.“I would be really mad if it was someone bad. But Nell’s a really good person, so it’s okay! She’s already my friend, and playing with her makes me really happy. If we all get married to you, then it means that all of us can be together forever! It’ll be the best!” she said with an innocent smile.That’s adorable. Buuuut it’s also the exact opposite of what I expected her to say. Feels bad, man. There goes plan B.“As you may have gathered from Illuna’s statement, the decision was unanimous. Still, it is by no means set in stone. I understand that our conclusion was reached in the lack of your presence and that we have no right to force it upon you. You are free to pretend that we had never discussed it if you so wish. But that is not what I desire.” The dragon girl paused for a moment to allow her mouth to twist into a wide grin. “Yuki, I wish for you to demonstrate that you are no mere boy. Show me that you are capable of handling a woman who has fallen madly in love with you in a manner worthy of praise. Show me that you are a man.”Lefi, please. I’m pretty sure wives aren’t supposed to get their husbands riled up about other women. That said, holy shit. That confidence though. Not to mention the open-mindedness. Hnnnng. I’m falling in love all over again. Lefi = best girl.I quickly looked over at one of the room’s corners and glanced at everyone currently seated at the table. Again, their reactions didn’t do much to help me. Both maids expressed that they didn’t have anything to say by shaking their heads. All Shii did was break into a big, innocent smile the moment I turned my eyes her way. Ermahgerd. What an angel. Hell, she’s more than just an angel. She’s probably some sort of archangel.Welp. That didn’t work. I guess I’ve pretty much got no choice but to resort to introspection. Alright, me, what do you make of this whole scenario? And be honest.After taking a moment to brood, I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t entirely against the idea. The thought of taking a second wife before I so much as took my first on a honeymoon was appalling. It bothered me to no end. But as a man, I couldn’t help but think rather fondly of harems and harem-like situations.The whole hero concept is a bit of a ridiculous shit show. Normally, I’d hate heroism and all that other autistic white knight bullshit, but that’s just ‘cause everyone’s fake as fuck. The only thing retards like that do is try to inflate their own egos by making themselves look good. But Nell isn’t like that. She’s genuine. She’s not some retarded poser that’ll suddenly have a change of heart the moment they’re put in real danger. She always faces every issue she encounters head on and gives it everything she has. And when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. She’s clearly willing to put her life on the line. I don’t really believe in her ideals, but I have to admit that the way she follows through on them makes her out to be one hell of a badass.That does kinda come off as a bit of a warning flag, but it’s also kinda charming, in its own right. A part of me wants to shirk away from her outta caution, but I think I’d probably rather spend more time with her than not anyway. You know, just to keep her out of harm’s way. Her safety matters to me. I can say with certainty that I value her as much as Illuna, Leila, and everyone else I live with.I know this next part is probably gonna sound shallow af, but it’s important. Nell’s one hell of a looker. She also just so happens to be my type. If I’d never met Lefi, I probably would’ve gone straight down the Nell route. Her telling me how she felt would’ve been more than enough to get me raising the sails and hoisting up the anchor. But that’s the thing. I did. I did meet Lefi.The Nell situation isn’t like the Lefi situation. Lefi is a lazy sack of shit with an obnoxious attachment to victory. And I love that about her. I love it as much as I love the fact that she’s probably the most thoughtful and caring person I’ve ever met. She understands how much all the little things really matter. As far as I’m concerned, Lefi is the definition of perfect. There simply isn’t anyone else like her. And as much as I’d like a harem, I just can’t. I can’t bring myself to not give Lefi the full, undivided affection she deserves. Yeah, you know what? I should probably talk to her about it. About time too. That was way more than enough introspection for one day.“Lefi, I love you. With all my heart,” I said. “I think Nell’s a good girl and that she deserves to be happy but honestly, I don’t really want any more wives. You’re the only girl for me.”
“I certainly appreciate the sentiment. I suppose I may as well take this opportunity to discuss the target of my own affections. I find that the man I love is far too kind,” she began to speak in a roundabout manner, seemingly out of embarrassment. “His disposition certainly bothers me. He is far too compassionate to guiltlessly cast aside a woman willing to, at a moment’s notice, discard even her very life for the sake of the affection she bears for him. It is a flaw I would only have appreciated if not for the fact that two such women exist.”
“Wow, what a lucky bastard,” I chuckled and played along. “Pulling a stunt like that must’ve cost him his whole lifetime’s supply of testosterone.”I got the message, loud and clear, so I slowly rose to my feet and readied myself for the conversation to come.“Look, I’m still on the fence about the whole harem thing, but I’ll at least go talk to her. I think it’s time she and I have a nice long chat.”
“It is,” said Lefi. “Now go. We will remain right here and await your return.”Lefi saw me off with a gentle smile as I walked out the door, one that radiated nothing but pure unadulterated kindness.<– Prev — Next –>

A Talk for Two
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerAs we were within the dungeon’s confines, tracking down the runaway hero was a simple task. All I had to do was pop open my map and follow the friendly marker. As I reached her, I realized that she had yet to recover from Lefi’s sudden outburst. She was looking out a window with her hands covering her still red face.“H-hey.” I stumbled over my words as I called out to her.
“H-hey.” Likewise, she replied with a stutter. Her face flushed an even deeper shade of red as she pulled her eyes away from the grassy plains that lay beyond the windowsill.An awkward moment of silence followed our greetings. We were both too nervous and flustered to start the conversation. After a few moments of hesitation, I remembered that I had just the thing to break the ice.“Oh right, I just remembered I have something for you.” I reached into my inventory and produced a large chunk of metal. “You probably shouldn’t be dropping this.”
“Is that Durandal!?” She gasped. “Thank you so much!”The sword had a rather interesting set of stats. Analyzing it led to the following result.***
General Information
Name: Durandal
Quality S++
Attack: 1029
Durability: 1692
MP: 1002Unique Skills
Analytical Impairment
Unbreakable
Skills
Self Repair VIIITitles
Defender of Order
The Unbreakable BladeSpecial Effects
Greater Magical Prowess Boost
Greater Physical Attack Boost
Greater Boost to the Efficacy of Healing EffectsDescription
A blade meant only to be used by a hero that stands by order and its defence. Durandal will never break under any circumstances and forever continue to protect those that require its aid. This weapon provides a fifty percent boost to all stats if wielded by a hero.
***I handed her the holy sword and the Yuki-brand leather sheath I had crafted for it. Though the scabbard was, technically speaking, made to order, it was by no means anything fancy. In fact, it was quite the opposite. It was just another bland looking case made of the simplest of leathers. I had only made it because it didn’t really quite feel right to leave the blade hanging around naked.My overall impression of the weapon was that it was needlessly durable. Its stats were higher than Enne’s in spite of the extent she had grown in the past month. But that doesn’t mean jack. Her effects are better, so she’s totally way better. Hah! Take that, you shitty holy sword! Your special effects suck! Plus, Enne’s still growing. Unlike basically every other weapon out there, she’s actually going to keep getting stronger. She’s got way more potential than a dinky little sacred blade or two. Another detail I had noticed was that not even the hero’s sword had a species. Enne was literally the only weapon I had ever seen with the label. Hah, you hear that, Durandal? Enne’s special! You ain’t got shit on her, bitch!Nell’s breathed a sigh of relief and finally did away with the vast majority of her embarrassment as she retrieved her weapon.“Thank goodness. I was really worried it was going to fall into enemy hands,” she said. “Was it hard to find?”
“Nah, not really. It caught my eye right away because of the way it shimmered under the sunlight. How’d you lose it anyway?”
“I lost it when they captured me,” she said. “But I was lucky. The person holding me wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, so I managed to trick him and shake him off. One of his allies kicked it away before I could start swinging it around again.”
“I’m surprised you managed to escape without your weapon.”
“I had a spare.” A shy smile appeared on her face as she drew the dagger mounted behind her waist.Lunar Blossom.It was the offhand I had given her back when I had paid the capital a visit in hopes of offing myself a prince. Huh… Looks like giving it to her turned out to be the right choice after all.“Thank you, Yuki. You’re the only reason I was able to keep fighting. You saved me twice that day.”
“I mean, once, sure. But twice? Nah. I didn’t do jack the first time. You might’ve used a weapon I gave you, but in the end, you saved yourself.”
“That’s not true at all.” She replied to my shrug with a shake of her head. “You’re the only reason I’m still breathing. I should have died back there.”The only response I offered was a silent frown, so she kept talking. Her voice took on a more solemn tone as she gave voice to her thoughts.“Oh, don’t look at me like that. I wasn’t trying to get myself killed. It’s just that there were too many of them. I was already at my limit, and there was no way I was going to be able to deal with all of them,” she said. “To be honest, I was scared. Really scared. I was so terrified I wanted to cry. I wanted to turn around, run away, and just forget about everything. But I couldn’t. I know I’m not strong enough to be worthy of the title, but I’m a hero, Yuki. I can’t just run. It’s only right for me to keep pushing myself to the very end. That was why I thought it was right for me to die. But I didn’t.”She turned her gaze up towards me, her lips curved into a small but meaningful smile.“You saved me right as I was about to give up. Right as I was about to die,” she laughed awkwardly, “I couldn’t help but think that you were like a knight in shining armour. Like you were my Prince Charming, there to save the day just in the nick of time.”
“Seriously…? Me? Prince Charming? A knight in shining armour? That’s gotta be a joke. I’m pretty sure that’s the least accurate way you could possibly describe me.”Nell seemed to have expected me to react the exact way I had, as she momentarily gave me a knowing, affectionate gaze. But rather than giving voice to the emotions she had buried within her chest, she chose to brush them off by heaving an exaggerated sigh, putting her hands on her hips, and scolding me as a mother would a child.“I know, right? You’re vulgar, you have no sense of delicacy, you’re kind of dumb, you’re selfish, you have weird interests, and you have no sense of delicacy! The image I had of the perfect man has been completely corrupted, and it’s all your fault! I’m not even sure what a real Prince Charming is supposed be anymore!”
“M-my bad…”Wait. She totally mentioned the whole delicacy part twice. Well then. I didn’t know it was bothering her thaaaaat much.“Geez, Yuki, you really need to learn to be more dignified! You can’t go around acting like an idiot if you’re going to call yourself a demon lord!”
“S-sure thing, coach. Won’t let it happen again.” The sudden harsh tone she took led me to wince and back down. Wow. I’m pathetic. This is probably a new low, even for me.
“Good.” The playful giggle she voiced was followed by a pause. A short pause, but a pause nonetheless. The look on her face made it clear that she wanted to say something, but she brushed it off instead of revealing it. “That’s all I wanted to say. Don’t worry about what everyone else said. That’s all, I promise!”
“Nell, I…” My voice trailed off as I struggled to find the right words.
“It’s okay! I’m okay. I mean, it’s true that I like you, but that’s only natural. You saved my life. I couldn’t help but start to see you in a better light. But it’s not like what Lefi said. She misunderstood.”Though she had put up a facade, I saw right through her. Nell was hiding her true thoughts and desires. All because she didn’t want to make me feel bad about having to turn her down. Because she didn’t want me to realize that I was making her suffer. She tried her very best to keep smiling even though she was on the edge of breaking down into tears.“You don’t need to worry about what Lefi and Illuna were going on about. All I want is for everything to go back to normal and you to act the same way as usual.”Rather than trying to convince me, it sounded more like she was trying to convince herself.“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” I crash-landed a hand on top of her head and ruffled her hair.
“Wha—!?”
“Alright, alright, enough of that already. At this point, you’re pretty much just rambling, so cut it out. I’m not about to let a kid worry her heart out about making me feel bad. I am a functional adult, after all.”
“A kid!? What’s that supposed to mean!? You’re way more of a kid than I am!”She whacked my hand away as she puffed up her cheeks and glared at me.“Yeah, I guess you could argue that I’m pretty childish,” I cackled. “But that’s just how we demon lords are. We do whatever the hell we want. Nothing more, nothing less.”
“Ughhhh, not this again! I can’t believe you! I was trying to have a serious conversation! Why did you have to go and pick a fight!?” she complained. “And stop trying using your title to worm your way out of everything! I know you’re attached to it, but it isn’t an excuse for anything!”Oh, looks like I wasn’t the only one aware of that after all. Whaddya know?“You say that, but it’s totally true. Demon Lords don’t give two fucks about anything or anyone. Being one means that I’ve got the right to do things my way, consequences be damned. Besides, I could throw those same words right back at you. Hell, they’re even more applicable to you than they are to me. Stop trying to use your title as an excuse to get yourself killed!”
“…Well, I’m not dead yet, am I?”I responded to her angry grumble with a shake of the head.“Look, being able to stand up to your enemies, and being able to fight to the very end certainly is something admirable. Most people back out in the face of death. And I get it, you got through it and lived. But what if you didn’t? What if you lost? It would’ve meant you died for your friends or whatever, sure, but that doesn’t mean jack shit. Look at the people around you right now and take a page outta their books. You see how free they are? How basically everyone does whatever the hell they want? Be more like them. Because that’s the secret to enjoying life.”
“They certainly do seem to be doing just that,” giggled the hero.Lefi was a prime example of someone that listened only to their whims, but she wasn’t the only one. Everyone that lived within the dungeon’s confines was living life the way they wanted. The school of thought had even rubbed off onto the children, who relished in the pure, unadulterated chaos that resulted from our day to day activities.“As far as I’m concerned, you’re way too uptight. You’re not letting yourself grow into your role. You’re not letting yourself slowly become a hero. It seems a lot more like you’re just desperately forcing yourself to act the part. Because your role as a hero shouldn’t take away from your life as an individual. You don’t have to be a copy-paste of whatever the stereotype is. You don’t have to let some silly old title dictate your every action. It shouldn’t stop you from being true to yourself.”
“…” Silence followed. Her lips trembled and her eyes started to tear up, but she didn’t—couldn’t—say a word.
“Now stop being so stubborn and tell me the truth. What do you really want?”Again, her lips trembled as she struggled to pick between her duty and herself. But not for long. I knew I had already pushed hard enough. The walls she had put up around her heart had already toppled over.“I… I just…” Slowly but surely, she began to speak. “I just want to be with you…”
“Yeah, well nothing’s stopping you, so consider that wish granted,” I said. “Everyone around here seems to like you, myself included. You’re welcome to hang around as long as you want.”The statement wasn’t exactly the truth, but it was close enough. The only individual still wary of Nell was Lyuu. Well, on the bright side, little Miss Useless happens to be a bit of a simpleton, so I’m sure she’ll warm up to her sooner or later. Plus, nothing wrong with a little white lie or two.“So uh, about what Lefi was going on about.” I awkwardly scratched the back of my head as I spoke. “That came as far outta left field for me as it did for you. So uhhh, yeah, sorry.”
“I should be the one saying sorry.” Nell sadly lowered her gaze. “I’m sure it must be a bother…”
“N-not at all. I’m happy you feel that way. Real happy. I’m a simple man with needs, after all.”
“R-really?”
“Really. You know, when I saw you all messed up and barely breathing, I ended up getting so mad I felt like a bull that’d seen red. And that was when I realized that I actually like you a lot more than I thought I did. You mean as much to me as the people I live with.”I paused for a moment to glance at the ring on my left hand.“But I’m married already, and I’m not planning on having any other wives. One’s enough to keep my hands full already. That said, Lefi was all like ‘Show me that you are capable of handling a woman who has fallen madly in love with you in a manner worthy of praise. Show me that you are a man,’ and whatnot. So I guess I gotta man up and deal with it one way or another.”
“That certainly does seem like something Lefi would say.”The way she giggled caused a blush to creep up on my face, but I swallowed my embarrassment and kept talking.“So yeah, long story short, feel free to live here.”
“Here? In this castle?”
“Yep. I’ve already told your buddies that you suffered a couple pretty terrible injuries, and that I’ll be taking care of you while you recuperate. Feel free to think of this as a well-deserved vacation, you know, a bit of sick leave to make up for all the hard work you’ve been putting in lately. That one city, er, Alfyro or whatever, is basically just a step away. If you really feel the need to tell everyone you’re okay, we can just head over and have you send them a letter or two.”
“But I…”
“But nothing. You’ve already done way more than enough, at least for now. No one’s going to get mad at you just ‘cause you realized you needed a bit of a break. Besides, I’d uhm… love to have you over. It sounds like it’d be fun.” I felt like I was going to start blushing, so I averted my gaze as I awkwardly elaborated.I was being about as far from smooth as I could, and I knew it. The only thing in recent memory the current situation resembled was the moment I proposed to Lefi. And although that was a much more embarrassing ordeal, I had been able to tough through it pretty easily. But that had only been because I was on the verge of death. The adrenaline pumping through my veins had blown all of my usual inhibitions out of the water.“So yeah, let’s just not think about all the stuff Lefi was going on about for now. Because like you said, it totally came outta the blue. I’d prefer to get to know you first before even considering it. That’s kinda why I’m saying you’re free to stick around.”I didn’t need a mirror to know that the look on my face was about as pathetic as looks could possibly get. Nell, however, seemed to find it rather endearing; she smiled as she watched me struggle with my sense of shame.“So does this mean we’re going to be starting as friends instead of jumping straight into a relationship?”
“Y-yeah, pretty much. I know that it’s kind of a bad deal for you.” I winced in a self-deprecating manner. “But, as pathetic and indecisive as that makes me sound, it’s pretty much the only compromise I’m willing to make.”
“It’s okay. I don’t think it makes you look even the slightest bit pathetic or indecisive.”
“Y-you think so?”
“Mhm. I understand”—she said as she began smiling ear to ear—“I know you’re doing your best not to hurt either of us, and that you’ve put a lot of thought into it before you made up your mind. That’s why I’m going to take you up on that offer, Yuki. I’ll live here in this castle and stay right by your side.”
“Glad to have you,” I smiled back at her before adopting an elegant neutral expression like the kind one would see on a butler. “I welcome you, Hero, to the Demon Lord’s Castle. My staff and I will ensure that you are provided only the finest accommodations.”
“This certainly does seem like a good escape from work. I am terribly exhausted, after all,” she said, playing along.
“Exhausted? How terrible,” I said. “Worry not, Hero. I know that our many fine luxuries will provide you an escape from the chore that is your everyday life. As this castle’s lord, I will do my utmost to ensure that we satisfy your every need.”Mwahahahaha! GG Hero, you’re done for! My castle has everything, a hot spring, a nice Japanese inn, great scenery, and even cute girls. It’s literally anything a man could ever ask for! You hear that, people? This demon lord’s castle is now open to the public. We promise the best service you could ever get. Call now and book your room today!“My every need? Then I hope you don’t mind if I go right ahead and get comfy.”She wrapped her arms around my waist and leaned into my chest. I panicked as I was suddenly subjected to the warmth of her body and the softness of her touch.“Errrr, what. I. What. W-what are you doing!?”
“You’re so warm…” She ignored all my floundering and nuzzled even closer.She was a tiny, dainty little thing. One whose frame was far too small to support the heavy burden that lay upon her shoulders. Knowing her endeavour was what prompted me to remain silent as I gently plopped a hand on her head and ran my fingers through her hair.<– Prev — Next –>

In the Eyes of a Dragon
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerThe hero’s sudden advent inspired in me naught but surprise. I had not expected her to apparate within the dungeon’s confines, let alone emerge with her garments torn and her frame smeared in filth. So numerous were the streaks of blood that adorned her that I found her still animate state difficult to comprehend—she was a terrible sight to behold.A brief moment of petrification assailed me as I observed her, but the spell did not last for long. There lay a towel nearby, one typically reserved for the children, used to clean their faces upon their return from their adventures. I retrieved it as I summoned Lyuu and entreated her to procure our medical supplies.Upon weaving an incantation meant to abate her injuries, I happened upon a realization. The hero was uninjured. Though her appearance indicated that she had suffered greatly, she bore no wounds. My ability to perceive, analyze, and quantify that which lay within my sphere of recognition informed me that she was in no immediate danger. Relief washed over my mind. She was safe.I looked over her once more and examined her condition in greater detail. Her breaths were taken at a regular pace, her bones appeared unbroken and her body unswollen. She was in good health in spite of her apparent distress.It was then that I understood that Yuki had purged her wounds prior to arranging for her transportation. Her lack of injuries was sourced from one of the many potions he carried on his person. I am aware of many of his methods. And yet, I know nothing of the technique employed in her ferriage.His ability to have her sent through the very fabric of space without his accompaniment was particularly curious. And yet, it came as no surprise, for Yuki’s antics were more often bizarre than not.“Is Nell gonna be okay…?” The child by my side, Illuna, raised her voice in concern.
“I believe so,” I provided her with a reassuring pat as I replied. “She is merely asleep. Yuki has already seen to her wounds.”Need I need be concerned for him? My thoughts drifted to the demon lord as I mentioned him in passing. As I did not wish to distress the children, I did not allow my worries to show. Still, they persisted. I was left with little anxiety over the safety of his flesh; I knew full well that there was little concern to be had for his physical health. My apprehensions lay with his mental fortitude, or rather the lack thereof. My husband appears to others as a confident, outgoing, and even arrogant man, one who is unable to be conquered by the likes of an attack on his psyche. But that is far from the truth. His heart is frail and his mind easily attacked. The value he places on those he holds dear is far too great for his well being. I know all too well that he would not allow his sense of rationality to stand in the way of his fury should he bear witness to one with whom he has concerned himself with coming to harm.Keeping an eye on him was a must. Fortunately, Leila and Enne were performing that exact action in my place. While the former’s ability to keep Yuki rational lay only within the realm of the questionable, I had no doubt that the latter’s presence would allow him to keep his rash nature at bay. I should have known that accompanying him was a choice I should not have forsaken. I regret nothing more than allowing myself not to be by his side.But what is done is done. I cannot change the past, and there is little use in lamenting my mistakes at this precise moment, for there is still much to be addressed. I directed my attention to the human that lay before me. I’d best move her somewhere more comfortable.***Many an hour passed before the girl finally began to stir.“Have you finally awoken?” Spurred on by my words, Nell groggily opened her eyes and examined her surroundings.
“Where… am I…?”
“You lay now within a dungeon’s confines, Yuki’s dungeon’s confines.”The sound of my husband’s name caused her to snap to attention. Hurriedly, she pushed herself up from the bed in which she lay and pieced together her consciousness.“W-where is he?” she stammered. “And what happened?”
“I do not know his whereabouts. He was not present upon your advent. But whatever the case, you would do best to remain calm.”My explanation appeared to provide her with a sufficient summary of the situation, as she quieted down and began to speak in a tone indicative of tranquillity and understanding.“Oh… I guess that must mean he saved me…” Her lips began to warp into a small but evident smile, one that failed to reach completion as she found herself awash with another wave of confusion. “Wait, Lefi!? Huh? What the heck!? I’m in Yuki’s dungeon!? Isn’t that all the way in the middle of the Wicked Forest!?”…It appears that I may have been mistaken in assuming that she had come to an understanding.While there had been others that had sat by the hero’s bedside, it was only I who remained by it even now. It was not that they were unwilling to attend to her, but rather disallowed by the passage of time. Even my own waking state was driven not by intention, but by habit. My husband and I would often make use of the time that we shared alone come nightfall to indulge in all manners of games that made use of cards, pieces, and boards. I do not understand. How is it that he retains his energy throughout the day in spite of so little rest? It is none other than our late night activities that drives me to spend so much time in bed.“That is correct. You are within the forest.” I replied. “How are you feeling? You appear unwounded, but I do not know if that is truly the case.”The hero turned her eyes on her body and examined it in detail. At first, there appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary, but I soon found her with her brows furrowed in confusion.“Huh…? What happened to all my injuries…?”
“It is to my understanding that Yuki made use of a potion and restored you prior to initiating your transport, for you were uninjured upon your arrival.”
“Yeah, I remember that, but… even all my scars are gone,” her voice faded into a mutter that expressed both denial and relief, “I had so many from all the training I went through…”
“Pay it no mind. Yuki’s potions are of a particular efficacy. The removal of old scars is but to be expected.” I raised and lowered my shoulders in an expression of indifference. “If you are in no pain, then it is best that you focus your efforts on the restoration of your stamina. I expect that you are hungry, yes?”
“Oh, uhm. Yeah, thanks.” Despite her still evident confusion, the hero accepted the bowl I offered her and lifted a spoonful of porridge to her lips. And in doing so, she froze. Her hands lost all momentum immediately prior to the act of consumption.
“Uhm, hey, Lefi? Not to sound rude or anything, but did you uhm… mix up the sugar and the salt?”An uncontrollable, discontent groan escaped my throat. I cannot believe myself. I know no longer the number of times I have made that very mistake. When was it that I erred? I vividly recall tasting it many times throughout its preparation and ensuring that I made use of the correct ingredients.“I… apologize,” I offered my condolences after an awkward pause. “Both Yuki and Leila have departed for the demon realm. None of us that have remained within the dungeon’s confines bear any significant skill in the culinary arts.”I lifted my hips off the chair positioned by her bedside as I continued to speak.“Worry not, I shan’t make you consume such a wretched creation. I will return shortly with a second bowl made anew.”
“It’s okay. It’s still edible, and I don’t mind.” The hero giggled. “Thank you, Lefi. I really appreciate it.”She stopped me in the middle of my ascension and began to consume the oddly flavoured porridge. Though I remained embarrassed by my own lack of competence, I abided by her will and returned to my seat.Following the interaction was a brief period of effective silence. The shuffling of the children in their sleep and the clinking of a spoon were the only two sounds to be heard.“Yuki…Yuki saved my life.” Nell set her tableware aside and began giving form to her thoughts. Each word that left her carried with it a deliberate purpose; she chose each carefully in turn as she voiced the last.
“Then it is as I suspected. It pleases me to know that my husband has proven himself to be of use.”
“Your… husband. Right. You two got married.”
“W-we did,” I stammered. “Did he mention the change in our circumstances?”
“He did. He bragged about it with a big, happy smile on his face.”My cheeks reddened as my mind assembled an image of the scenario she described. However, my embarrassment soon faded as I caught wind of a minor yet glaring detail. The smile that rested upon the hero’s face was unnatural. Forced.As was typical of draconic beings, I knew little of the expressions of humans. I found it difficult to discern the intricacies of their gestures. And yet, I knew hers. It was a countenance that served to indicate she was desperately suppressing her emotions, a guise typically worn in the event that one was left with no choice but to give up on securing a particular individual as a mate.“Have you…” I hesitated to confront her at first, but soon continued as I shook off the shackles of my uncertainty. “Have you fallen for him?”
“Wha!? Huh!? N-no! Not at all! Y-you’ve got it all wrong!”So flustered was the hero that I had little choice but to smile. How terribly easy to read, she is. But I suppose that such is the way of a hero.…Or perhaps not. Considering the concept of heroism reminded me of a man I had once reduced to cinders. He too shared in her status, but was of a dissimilar nature. He was proud, boastful, and knew nothing of the natural order. Our confrontation was one-sided. The ancient hero found himself as helpless as a mere hatchling before my might. It was not that heroes were straightforward and honest, but rather that the individual before me happened to be of such a disposition.“Calm yourself. There is no need for you to panic. I do not plan to inflict any harm upon you regardless of your answer. It was a question I posed only out of simple curiosity,” I said. “So? Have you fallen for him?”
“I…think so.”
“A more ambiguous way to describe your emotions I have never heard.”
“T-That’s just because I’m not really sure…” said Nell. “I don’t think I’ve ever fallen in love before, so I’m not really sure if that’s what this is.”I momentarily shut my eyes and reflected upon the situation.She and I were no different. Even our thoughts and emotions ran parallel. Yuki certainly does have quite the unfortunate talent for seduction.“I-it’s not really my fault…The way he saved me just made him seem so cool! How could I not fall in love with him after something like that…?”With a slight blush adorning her face, the hero recounted the events that led to her advent.***“I cannot believe that he appeared at such a critical juncture without any prior planning.”
“I know, right! And this isn’t the first time he’s done this either! He did the same thing when he visited Alshir!”
“He is simply that type of man. Despite claiming to put little emphasis on it, he is sure to steal the spotlight and position himself centre stage if presented the opportunity. It is a quirk of his nature.”
“Right!? He always perfectly resolves the situation the moment you take your eyes off him! And then he acts like it was no big deal! And I can swear that almost everything he does catches me off guard!”Voicing our complaints about the man at whom our affections were directed led us both to giggle.“I wish I knew this was going to happen…” As her laughter faded, it was replaced by a smile that reeked of sorrow. “I know I can’t possibly mean more to him than you, but I would have at least tried to tell him how I felt if I had known you were going to get married.”Again, I was led to understand that she and I were no different. I understood her. I knew her feelings well. Because like her, I too had found myself drawn to—charmed by—the comfortable air that lay about Yuki’s person. Like her, I knew all too well that he was an idiot and that his sensibilities differed far from my own, but I had fallen for him nonetheless. Because I knew that being by his side was sure to put a smile on my face. It is as if we are as one. Regarding her feels no different from gazing upon my own reflection.And that was the thought that spurred me to direct my inquiries inward. Would I be able to bear the fate to which she must? Would I be able to return to living in mateless solidarity after knowing his warmth? His kindness?I needed not even the briefest of moments to arrive at a conclusion.Absolutely not.I knew that I could not bear a life spent without him any longer.“I shall allow you to live with us.” I raised my voice immediately upon reaching the conclusion. I could not be so cruel as to consign one of the few I saw as a friend to a fate that not even I could endure.
“Huh…?” She turned her eyes upon me in confusion.
“He is unlikely to refuse the request should you make it, for I know that he thinks rather fondly of you.” I continued to speak. “I would not mind you taking up a place at his side, even in the case that you one day find yourself as another of his brides.”
“T-that would make me really happy, but are you sure? That would probably make you sad, wouldn’t it?”
“I certainly do not think nothing of it. But I also do not think nothing of you. I know your sorrows well and I do not wish to force you to bear them.”I almost wished to break into laughter. I could not help but find myself entertained by the extent to which I concerned myself with her emotional well being. I would not have lamented over it in the past. But Yuki had changed me.“I have known for all too long that it is impossible for me to remain his sole lover.” I gazed upon the vampire and the slime sleeping in their respective beds. “They are likely to join in sharing my status upon coming of age.”Yuki had already promised them that he would take them as his own should the time come. I knew well that it was a statement he made only to entertain the children, but it was likely that he would one day have to own up to his words.While it was only the children that had expressed interest in his affections, I knew that they were not the only residents that may one day pine for his affections. I suspected that the maidservants could also come to adore him.Picturing a future in which we shared his love was an easy feat, one that left me with a gentle smile. I loved him. But I also loved them. And I wished for their happiness as much as I desired my own. Each individual I resided with was an equal part of the fortune I hoarded. None could be replaced, and each had an intrinsic value that disallowed their substitution. My brood was warm and accepting. It was for that reason that I was unable to see them objecting to one so kind and honest joining our ranks. She was sure to become yet another part of my fortune and imbue my days with yet another layer of joy. Still, I find it odd to know that I have considered the likelihood of her acceptance. I cannot see it as anything but strange for the one feared as the Supreme Dragon to be so concerned with the emotions of others.“We have spoken much tonight,” I said. “You require much rest, and I believe that our discussion is one that will require the others to be present. Let us continue in the morning.”
“Okay,” replied the hero. “Hey, uhmmm… Lefi…”
“What is it?”
“Thanks for being so nice to me. I really like that part of you.”
“E-enough,” I stammered. “Cease your prattling and rest.”
“Mmk. Thanks again for everything. Good night, Lefi.”
“Sleep well, Nell.”With those words as our last, we returned to our beds and allowed the night to pass.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero Joins the Demon Lord’s Faction
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerBy my command, all of the dungeon’s residents gathered within one of its halls for an assembly. Though I would have normally chosen to host the event in the throne room, some of my pets were, unfortunately, far too large to fit. That was why I ended up choosing a larger room that did, a room that didn’t typically see much in the way of use. Oh, who am I kidding? Doesn’t typically see much in the way of use? Yeah, right. More like it’s literally never been used.“So yeah, got a quick announcement to make. This is Nell. She’s going to be hanging around for a bit, so play nice.”
“H-hi everyone, I’m Nell. Nice to meet you,” stuttered the hero.
“Is she not to be another of your wives?” asked Lefi.
“Congratulations, Nell! Now you’re married too!” said Illuna.
“Hey, you with the silver horns, and you, blonde with the fangs. Pipe down already. This is an assembly. We’re being formal. You two are getting way too out of hand,” I said.Like, come on girls. Why you gotta make it out to be like that? ‘Cause it’s really not. She’s just here to take a nice, long, well-deserved break from work, and that’s all there is to it.“So like I was saying,” After clearing my throat, I continued to speak. “Make sure you all play nice and be good to each other. Anyway, give her a round of applause or something to show her how welcome she is.”The audience began clapping as instructed, which led Nell, who had been standing by my side, to shyly offer everyone her thanks. Alright, so I know I literally told you guys to clap. But not all of you really needed to clap. I was really only talking to you know, the people with hands? Like, come on snake-bro. I know you’re just doing your best, but you really need to stop. You smacking your tail against the floor is shaking the whole damn castle.“Well, Miss Hero, it looks like you’ve officially joined the demon lord’s faction.”
“Uhm… I’d really appreciate if you didn’t put it like that. It’s a bit misleading.”
“Well, Miss Hero, it looks like you’re so good at your job you’ve even managed to befriend a supposed arch nemesis,” I said while rolling my eyes, “So how about telling us a bit about your aspirations?”
“M-my aspirations?” She panicked a bit as I suddenly passed her the torch. “Uhmmm… uhmmm… well, I don’t really know anyone all that well just yet, so I guess I’d like to make friends with everyone so we can get to know each other better.”
“That sounds like a great idea!” First to step up to the plate was Illuna. “I can’t wait! We’re all going to be best friends forever!”The vampire’s comment opened the floodgates; each of the dungeon’s members followed with their own comments and blessings in turn. Sweet. It looks like everyone’s actually getting along. Hell, I’d even go out on a limb and say that they’re all a lot more invested in this than I am.“Alright, that’s one topic outta the way. Time to move on to the next item on the agenda,” I said. “Did anything notable happen around here while I was out?”
“There was little of note outside of Nell’s sudden advent.” Lefi began to speak on behalf of all the others. “A single incident did occur. A group of demons entered the forest soon after your departure.”
“Okay, so we got a few intruders. That sounds pretty normal to me. Did they do anything special?”
“They did not. Their sole accomplishment was to be slain by the forest’s creatures soon after our pets drove them from our domain,” said Lefi.F.Who were they anyway? Were they fiends? Probably, I guess, but it was probably ‘cause they figured out that I was the guy who messed up their plans in that one human country, and not ‘cause I was kicking their shit in while I was hanging out in the demon realm. The timeline wouldn’t really work out any other way.I knew that I would be found out eventually. It was only a matter of time before they connected the dots and realized that I was the guy responsible for giving their chief a good old punch to the jaw. But I wasn’t concerned. I could easily plow my way through their ranks if they ever came a knocking. Fuck those faggots. God, even just remembering them pisses me the fuck off. Especially the fucking redhead. Fuck him for wanting to use Lefi like a fucking weapon. Ughhh. Why didn’t I kill him when I had the chance? Ughhhhhhhhhhh. So much regret.Whatever. I’m going to murder him one of these days, so it doesn’t fucking matter. You hear that, asshole? Enjoy what’s left of your life while it lasts. Because it won’t. Not if I can help it.…Alright, Yuki, deep breaths. Enough of that already. This isn’t the time to fume over some retard you happened to meet while you were out on vacation. After calming myself down, I put plotting the douchebag’s demise on the backburner. I was still going to go through with it, and soon, of course, but there was a time and place for everything. And this wasn’t it.Lefi’s awareness of the invaders stemmed from her ability to access the dungeon’s menu. She didn’t have full access to it, but she was able to use the map, set traps, telepathically communicate with our pets, and use a part of the catalog. Or at least that was what she could have done had she been more tech savvy. To Lefi, video games were a concept nothing short of foreign. She had no experience navigating their menus, and as such, was effectively incapable due to how convoluted and unintuitive they happened to be. Man, now that I think about it, games and usability have never really gone hand in hand. Understanding the UI is pretty hard unless you already know the framework.“There is little more that occured whilst you adventured throughout the demon realm,” said Lefi. “I know little else but the matter of our lament over the lack of well-cooked meals. I was so touched by the salvation Nell brought us that I nearly broke into tears.”
“Uh huh…” I turned towards the hero. “I guess that means you’ll probably be joining me and Leila on kitchen duty.”
“Okay. I’ll do my best!” She pumped her fists. The action was conducted in such a way that it wouldn’t have been acceptable coming from a man, but was perfectly fine given that she wasn’t. You know, the way she acts is actually kinda cute now that I think about it. Especially since it seems much more natural than forced.Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have asked a guest to bother with the chores. But I realized that it would probably be best to have her help out given the length and nature of her stay.“And while we are on the subject, Yuki, you need not partake in the creation of tonight’s meal.”
“You sure? ‘Cause you know, you were literally just talking about how you wanted me to cook.”
“I am. You would do well to remain outside our regular living quarters while the preparations are underway. In fact, I would very much prefer that you do not approach them,” she said. “Nell, I would like you to join him. I encourage the two of you to make good use of the opportunity and engage in whatever coquetry you wish whilst the rest of us keep busy.”…Lefi pls.I wasn’t the only one to react to Lefi’s nonsense. Nell did too. She turned red as she looked upon me with her eyes upturned. I could practically feel her desire boring into me; her emotions were completely out of control even though everyone was watching. Please stop.“Right, yeah, sure, whatever you say, Lefi. We’ll probably end up hanging around the inn. Are we going to need to watch the kids?”
“Do not concern yourself with them. Your sole task is to engage the hero in intimacy.”
“Uhhh… suuuuuure… I guess…?”Something was up, and I knew it. But I didn’t really feel like pursuing the topic any further, so I ended up nodding along and leaving the true throne room as per Lefi’s demands.***Once the curtains rose, Nell and I found ourselves in front of a brand new backdrop. The castle’s interior was gone, replaced by a building whose construction reeked of generations upon generations of Japanese tradition. We were in a room I was sure the young hero would find familiar, the room I had brought her to during her first visit. This time, we weren’t sitting across from each other, however. Our cushions were instead placed side by side so we could face the garden as we conversed.“Soooooooooo… Uhh…. What do you think everyone else is up to?”
“I-I dunno.”My attempt at starting a conversation failed.We were once again plunged into silence. Awkward silence. God dammit. You know what this is? It’s all Lefi’s fault. She just had to go run her mouth and tell us to flirt and shit. Seriously man, why’s she gotta be so gung ho about this? Seriously, what the hell? I’m pretty sure having your wife push more wives onto you is one helluva far cry from the typical newlywed experience.I was well aware of the fact that my situation was one that would make most men burn with envy, but I wasn’t buying it. If anything, it made me feel lonely, and even somewhat depressed. It’s almost like she doesn’t care.“H-hey, Yuki?”
“What’s up?”My train of thought was interrupted as the girl beside me began to speak.“So what were you doing in the demon realm anyway? The only thing you told me was that you were taking part in some sort of tournament.”
“Well, I mean, there really isn’t much more for me to tell you. Let’s see… I did the whole tourney thing, went around sightseeing, and sparred a bit with the king’s men. That’s pretty much it,” I said. “Oh, right, speaking of the tourney. You know that one old guy you were travelling with? Yeah, he’s badass as fuck. Like, holy shit. My stats are way higher than his, but it still took me ages to beat him. And that was with him taking me head-on.”
“Huh!? You fought and even beat Remiero!?”
“Yeah. Him and I ended up in the same bracket. And holy shit, he was terrifying. I can’t believe someone that old was that goddamn strong.”While he hadn’t done much at all to my health pool, the old vet had almost single-handedly destroyed my confidence. Every single one of his actions had reeked of pure, unadulterated skill. Seriously dude, that fight? One hell of a learning experience right there. Was a whole bunch of life lessons in one.“Remiero has always been widely known as the strongest human. He’s so strong that he’s even got a catastrophe-class monster kill under his belt,” said Nell. “I’m surprised you managed to take him down.”Catastrophe? What was that again? Oh, right, yeah, I remember. It’s one of them monster classifications, right? I know Lefi technically doesn’t count as a monster, but I’m pretty sure she’s regarded as a part of the calamity class. And since catastrophe’s the second-highest, that means he managed to beat something that’s just one rung lower on the pecking order. Wow. Uh… wow. Like, seriously. That old man’s a fucking raid boss.Catastrophe-class monsters were so overpowered that not even demons dreamed of taking them on despite being blessed with greater innate strength. And yet, he had managed to defeat one whilst remaining nothing more than human. I mean, granted, he was probably younger back then, so his stats were probably a good bit higher. But still.The most terrifying thought of the entire ordeal was that I could see it happening. I didn’t think any other individual, human or demon, was capable of such a feat, but for some odd reason, I could see the old butler handling it with ease.“Yeah, I can see where you’re coming from. He was hella strong,” I said. “And I know I probably don’t really look like much of a fighter, but I would’ve been more surprised if I lost to him. ‘Cause I’ve even managed to take down a dragon.”Well, kinda. It was more like the dungeon did it. All I really did was grit my teeth and sit through a metric fuckton of pain. Contemplating the many terrifying creatures that this world was home to once again led me to thank the dungeon for reincarnating me as a demon lord. I would’ve been in real deep shit if I was still human. Though, uh, that said, I’m starting to feel like I’ve been getting a bit too far ahead of myself lately. Confidence is fine, but overconfidence really isn’t. I need to be more careful if I don’t want to end up like ol’ Gil over there. And uh, Iunno about you, but I’d really rather not get stuck in some sort of shitty gilgamess. Which means I should probably be putting safety first and confidence second. Yeah, I really should. I’ve been getting way too reckless, even for my own tastes, so I’mma make staying safe my motto from now on.“Seriously, Yuki? You killed a dragon!? What the heck! You’re all sorts of unreasonable.”
“Being unreasonable is just what demon lords do. That’s the whole point of the role, you see. You ignore every other asshole out there and push your own ideals forward, consequences be damned.”
“That’s the first time I’ve heard that,” she giggled.
“Yeah, well, that’s just ‘cause I’m one of the first to finally take the theory and put it into practice. All the other demon lords out there are just mindless sheep. Me, I don’t follow standards, I set them.”
“What’s that even supposed to mean?” Again, she giggled. Once she stopped laughing, the look on her face switched to that of an affectionate smile.And again, we were met with silence. But this time, it wasn’t so much awkward as it was pleasant.“Hey, Yuki?”
“What?”
“…It’s nothing.”
“Oh, come on. All you’re doing is making me more curious.”
“But it really was nothing.” She plopped her head on my shoulder and leaned into me as she spoke.Guilt washed over me. I immediately thought of Lefi. But I didn’t push her off. Rather than allowing myself to be consumed by a sense of wrongdoing, I chose to bask in the comfort of the moment and leave it be.And so, the two of us continued to spend our time doing exactly what she had described.Nothing.Together.We simply sat by each other’s sides and relaxed until it was time to go.<– Prev — Next –>

Anniversary
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Our preparations have been completed. The two of you may now return to our living quarters.” Lefi called for Nell and I through one of the portal-like doors placed all around the dungeon.
“Took ‘em long enough. Alright Nell, time to go.”
“Mhm. Seems like it.”I grabbed the cushions we had been sitting on and returned them to the pile situated in the room’s back corner. I then opened the door, waltzed right into the hallway, and began to advance. Ten-odd steps later, I found myself face to face with Lefi, who had her arms crossed and her face adorned with a dauntless smile.“You may only proceed if you close your eyes.”
“I have to close my eyes?” I raised a brow. I was getting pretty curious.
“Indeed. Now shut them immediately. I am speaking to the both of you.”
“Alright,” I said.
“Mmk,” said Nell.I followed her instructions and closed my eyes, only to find myself immediately greeted by a cool, comfortable sensation as her hands closed on my own. As I only felt one of her hands, I assumed that Nell had been subject to the exact same circumstances. She soon began to move, so I followed her lead while focusing on my feet and making sure I didn’t trip.“You may now open your eyes.”Following a prompt from the dragon girl, I opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was a literal mountain of food. The dishes laid out before me were so extravagant that a glance was enough for me to recognize that an incredible amount of time and effort had gone into each. My nose was just as attracted to the meal as my eyes were. Taking in the many delectable fragrances that had melded into the air was almost enough to make me drool.My gut seemed to want to tell me that Leila had been responsible for the meal, but a second glance immediately disqualified her as the chef. It simply wasn’t neat enough. That wasn’t to say that the dinner table had been turned into some sort of convoluted mess. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Whoever had arranged the dishes was very clearly taking the would-be consumer into consideration. But unlike Leila’s handiwork, it wasn’t perfect. And that was the giveaway.Leila possessed a deep understanding of the psyche. She knew exactly where she would need to place each and every dish such that your eyes would be drawn from one to the next without pause. The perfection with which she carried out her kitchen duties was akin to an artist’s signature, a signature that clearly seemed to be missing from the current setup.After giving dinner a once over, I looked at the people situated around the table. The three of us aside, everyone else was already seated. Even the wraith girls were present in spite of their inability to eat.“Wow. This looks great.”
“Uhm… is this what I think it is?” asked Nell.
“So you have noticed?” The dragon crossed her arms and grinned.I gave the table one last scrutinizing glance before turning back towards her. “Did you make all this, Lefi?”
“While I did indeed accept assistance from the children, tonight’s meal is undoubtedly my work,” she said. “What are your impressions? I believe you will find it a far cry from the last meal I prepared you.”
“Definitely. I’m impressed. Really impressed,” I said.The difference between the meal laid out before me and the last meal she had made me was as vast as the difference between night and day. Oh man, I remember those cookies. They were probably bad enough to kill. This though? This’ll kill for a whole different set of reasons. ‘Cause I’m about to gorge myself enough to catch type 2.Today’s Lefi brand meal was clearly the result of a near excessive amount of hard work. It was easy for me to imagine her doing her best and continuing to push her best efforts forward without letting her numerous failures get to her.“Wait. Was this the reason you chose not to come with me to the demon realm?”
“Indeed,” she nodded,” it has been a year since our first encounter. I felt the need to put a foot forward for the sake of our anniversary.”Woah. The environment doesn’t really seem to change at all with the passing of the seasons, so I’d never actually realized, but now that I think about it, it really has been a whole year already. It’s been a year since Lefi and I met. And a year since I first came to this world.“I wished to demonstrate that I was capable of growth. I found this the perfect opportunity to put together a celebration,” she said. “As your wife, it is imperative that I endeavor to assist you with the housework to the best of my abili—”She didn’t get to finish speaking. I followed through on an impulse, picked her up, and started spinning her around before she could. I was simply too overcome with emotion not to.“Thanks Lefi. You’re the best wife ever, and I love you to bits.”
“C-cease this immediately! We are before all the others!”She flushed a shade of red and even began hitting my arms to get me to release her, but I absolutely refused. Because I understood. It wasn’t that she wasn’t completely unpossessive. Or that she didn’t care. The Nell situation had bothered her, and she had been a bit anxious. She didn’t not love me. She was doing her best for me. She wanted to become the best wife she could because she wanted my attention. And that alone was enough to send me over the clouds.It was a silly, roundabout way for her to express her concerns. But one that was adorable nonetheless.It was just like her.Perfect.While she evidently remained a bit anxious, I knew there was no way I would ever lose sight of my affections for her. Because demon lords were incarnations of desire. Greed was a feature built into my system. Every last bit of treasure that I got my hands on would forever remain a part of my trove. And nothing would ever be allowed to escape.“I-I understand your affections well, but you must release me! Our evening meal will lose its warmth should you continue!”
“Good point. There’s no way I could possibly let the meal my adorably wifey put together for me go cold. That’d be a sin,” I said. “Alrighty then. I’ll save all the hugging and spinning for later.”
“You need not continue,” she grumbled.The bashful manner in which she conducted herself only made me want to hug her all the more, but I didn’t want dinner to get cold, so I begrudgingly released her and began heading towards my seat. Likewise, Lefi began to do the same, only to come to a sudden halt when she realized that Nell had stopped following her.“Are you not joining us?” she asked.
“Uhm… I think I’ll pass. I’d rather not get in the way of your first anniversary. It’d probably be best if I stayed at the inn until you guys are done celebrating,” she said, awkwardly.
“I do not see your point. This banquet is one in which you are more than welcome to partake.”
“R-Really?”Lefi reacted to the hero’s dumbfounded question was an exasperated sigh.“My original intent was certainly for this banquet to be dedicated to Yuki alone.” She rapped the back of one of her hands against my chest. “But that is no longer its sole purpose. It is also to serve as a celebration of your arrival, a so called welcome party, if you will.”The dragon’s tone was almost akin to that of someone speaking to a younger sibling.“Now come, join us.”
“Yeah, come on. Hurry up and grab a seat already. Don’t make me wait any longer. ‘Cause I really can’t,” I said.
“A-Alright,” stuttered the human.
“You should sit with us, Nell!” said Illuna with a big smile.
“Yeah, with us!” echoed Shii.
“Sure! Thanks, girls,” said Nell.
“Hey Nell, are you gonna be okay without a fork?” asked Lyuu.
“I think I’ll be okay with chopsticks. I’m not really used to them just yet, but I’m sure I’ll get used to them if I use them enough. Thanks, Lyuu!”Wait a second… Wasn’t she supposed to be terrified of her?“When did you two suddenly start getting along?” I asked.
“A good while ago, Master,” said the maid. “Nell’s a real nice girl, and she’s got this kinda sisterly feel to her, y’know? I just can’t not make sure she’s taken care of.”
“That’s real rich coming from you, seeing as how you started shaking in your boots the moment you heard she was a hero.”
“T-that’s just because I didn’t know her yet! But now I do. She’s real kind, so I ain’t scared of her one bit no more!”
“T-thanks Lyuu! You’re really nice too,” replied Nell, a bit shyly.
“Enough. It would be best for us to get to eating,” said Lefi. “Yuki, I shall allow you to do the honours.”
“Huh? What? Why am I doing them?”
“Are you not the man of the house?”
“Riiiight, good point,” I said. “Well, uhhhh, alright. Everyone have their cups at the ready?”
“We’ve all been ready, Yuki!” said Illuna.
“Alright. Well, here’s to the first year of many to come. And to give a warm welcome to our newest resident. Cheers!”
“Cheers!”And so, the banquet began. The cheerful, noisy atmosphere it carried lasted late into the night.<– Prev — Next –>

What Kind of Teenager Doesn’t Think of Running Away From Home?
Editors: SpeedphoenixThe addition of a new resident had led to a dungeon-wide wave of excitement. As I didn’t want to spoil the mood, I waited until it receded before addressing the next issue on my agenda: Lyuu.“Hello, I’m looking for a Miss Lyuuine Gyroll?” I took on a formal tone as I called for her.
“W-what is it, Master?” She stuttered. If the stark contrast between the professional front and my usual behaviour wasn’t enough to unnerve her, addressing her by her full name evidently was.I did as any traditional, high-class, Japanese official would do and placed myself onto a cushion with my legs under my rear.“Please, have a seat.” After taking my place, I gestured for her to do the same.She was too nervous not to comply. The wolf-girl timidly obeyed and sat across from me.“You see, Ms. Gyroll, there happens to be a particular issue I would like to address.”
“A-and what would that be, Master?”
“I suppose I might as well begin with a question of my own,” I said. “Are you hiding anything from me?”
“H-hidin’ anything!? I’m sorry! I wasn’t tryin’ not to tell you! I just forgot! I’m real sorry about the plate! I didn’t think it was gonna brea—” She didn’t catch onto the fact that her words would reveal the truth until they had already left her mouth, but she tried to silence herself regardless by sealing her lips with her palms.…Well then. I mean, that wasn’t exactly what I was looking to hear, but uh, good to know. I’mma probably have a word with Leila once we’re done here so I can make sure Lyuu gets the good old fashioned stern lecture she deserves.“This isn’t about the plates, Ms. Gyroll. I was speaking in reference to your family situation.”She finally seemed to have come to realize where I was about to take the conversation, as she reacted with an immediate, audible gulp.“You see, Ms. Gyroll, there have been a few unpleasant rumours flying around the dungeon about your origins. One of your coworkers recently filed a report and informed me that you happened to be a runaway.”
“It was Leila, wasn’t it!? I bet it totally was!”
“That is correct,” I said. “She explained that you were keeping it from me despite it being something you should have made me aware of.”
“I uhm… I’m sorry, Master.” Nervous, cold sweat dripped down her brow as she apologized in a quiet voice.I started to feel just a tiny bit bad for her, so I sighed, shrugged, and dropped the formalities.“I mean, don’t get me wrong. I like having you around, and I’m glad you like it here. I just think you should probably let everyone else in your life know that you’re still alive and kicking, especially since they’ll probably find out you got kidnapped. I mean, you’re not the only one to blame. I really should’ve asked you, all of you, about this kinda stuff before you settled in.”Learning more about each resident’s past was one of the few things I had effectively soldered to the backburner. It was in part because I didn’t feel the need to know about their families and in part because it was a touchy subject. The former of my two excuses stemmed from the fact that I more or less saw the dungeon as one big family. I simply never felt the need to ask. On the other hand, the latter stemmed from Illuna’s situation; I had avoided bringing up any potentially touchy subjects in order to avoid digging up the various residents’ unpleasant memories.My adventures in the demon realm had led me to learn a lot more about Leila. She had been captured whilst out on a journey. And while her situation was by no means a good one, it was still better than Lyuu’s. Her family had at least known that she was going to set out on a trip from which she may never return. Lyuu’s, on the other hand, was left in the dark. Unlike Leila’s family, they wouldn’t know where she was headed or what they needed to do to find her. They would be left in the dark until they uncovered the truth behind her kidnapping. Plus, we’ve already resolved the Leila situation since we met her sister in the demon realm.If I was Lyuu’s dad, I would’ve totally lost my shit. I know I’d do exactly that if Illuna ever went missing again. I’d definitely end up bulldozing right through everything in my way until I finally found her. Lyuu’s status made the situation even worse. She was the daughter of her people’s leader.Their princess.I know you’re thinking that Lyuu can’t possibly be a princess because she’s too derpy. I totally get it. But if you think about it, it kinda makes sense. Like, what if she’s only a clumsy idiot because she’s always just had other people take care of her?There was no doubt that her father was searching for her. And that his men were doing the same. I knew that his mind would most likely turn to thoughts of vengeance the moment he learned of her kidnapping. And since she’s ended up as one of my maids, he’ll probably end up turning his ire on me. Greaaaaaaat. I mean, I can totally tell him that she literally asked for it, but I doubt he’ll believe me.“Uhmmm… I’m real sorry, Master…” She spoke in a hesitant, awkward tone. “Me and my dad, we never really saw eye to eye, so I don’t really wanna go home.”
“Look…” I sighed. “You don’t have to stay, but I really think you should at least pay them a visit and tell all your friends and relatives that you’re still doing alright. I know you really don’t want to go, and that they’ll probably be against you leaving. So how about this? What if I come with you? If they start trying to force you to stay against your will, then I’ll step in and make sure you get right back to the dungeon. Even if I have to be a little… less than cordial.”
“W-wow Master! You’d really do all that just for me!?” The eyes she turned upon me were like that of a lost puppy’s: teary, desperate for salvation, and full of hope.
“Yeah, I would,” I laughed. “I’d definitely miss you. Things just wouldn’t be the same without you.”
“W-wow. Thanks, Master,” She said, bashfully, “I never knew you thought that much of me.”
“Why wouldn’t I? You’re the best comic relief there is.”
“Comic relief!?”
“Yeah. You are pretty much always the butt of the joke, after all. And that’s pretty much why the dungeon needs you, why I need you.”
“What the heck, Master!? You’re terrible! You really need to stop makin’ fun of me! I’m not just here for comic relief!”I couldn’t help but cackle as she lightly pounded me with her fists in protest.***The original plan was for us to set out for Lyuu’s hometown the next day, but the warwolf in question had ended up refusing under the pretense that she still had a few things to think about before she was ready to leave. That was why I instead found myself out hunting with all five of my combat-capable pets in tow.“Hm…?” My eyes flickered to the dungeon’s map, which had suddenly popped open in the middle of the outing for the same reason as usual. Intruders.
“Oh boy… here we go…”
“What’s wrong, Yuki?” Nell, who had tagged along because she wanted to check out the forest, turned her eyes on me curiously.
“Eh, nothing special. Just another group of intruders.”
“Intruders? You mean someone’s invading the dungeon?”
“Right. I just realized I never told you this, but I can basically tell whenever anyone steps into my territory. It’s just how the demon lord-dungeon relationship works.”
“Oh… So does that mean you knew right away when I attacked too?”
“Pretty much, yeah.”I opened up a second window and had it switch to the live footage I was getting from the Evil Eyes I had scattered all over my domain. Through it, I confirmed that, this time, the intruders weren’t humans or demons.They were beastkin.Warwolves.Just like Lyuu. <– Prev — Next –>

The Gyroll Clan — Part 1
Editors: Speedphoenix, JokerA good number of warwolves had entered my territory. Performing an exact headcount proved to be rather difficult given the fact that they were in the midst of combat, but I could at least discern that there were somewhere between fifty and a hundred of them. Yeah, so I’mma go ahead and say that it doesn’t really take a genius to figure out that these are probably Lyuu’s people.Man, I know it was just one day, but this is what we get for putting off our little trip to her parents’ house. I should’ve just forced her to go. Er, actually… On second thought, we might’ve ended up missing each other if we really did leave today, so this might actually be for the better. Well, Lyuu, congrats. Your laziness paid off.“Is it just me, or are things looking pretty bad for them?” I muttered under my breath. “It looks like they’re being attacked by every monster they encounter.”Unlike the humans, the warwolves didn’t have magical items capable of repelling monsters. Naturally, that meant they were constantly under attack. In fact, they had only chanced upon my territory because they were in the midst of fleeing from one of their many assailants. That said, they had yet to be done in. In fact, as far as I could tell, they had yet to suffer even a single loss. Their excellent teamwork was stopping them from winding up as some strange animal’s dinner. For now. Though I praised their efforts, I knew they weren’t sustainable. Each wave of beasts would render more of their warriors incapable of combat.It was only a matter of time before they were sent to the grave. Though I was heartless, I wasn’t heartless enough to leave what was likely Lyuu’s next of kin to die. I had to act. Plus, they might feel like they owe me if I lend them a hand. Which means I might actually get to solve this with words instead of getting jumped by some blood-crazed father.“Well, I guess I’ve got no choice but to step in,” I groaned. “Alright newbies, you guys go on ahead and kick the shit out of all the monsters in the area. Should be a breeze with how much you’ve all grown. Just make sure you watch your backs. The warwolves will probably attack you, so make sure you retreat as soon as you’re done getting rid of all the monsters.”The red snake, the crow, the twin-tailed cat, and the waterball all telepathically acknowledged my orders and immediately set off.“Sorry, Nell, but I think that’s probably going to be it for today. You mind doing me a favour and heading back to the dungeon?”
“Sure, I don’t mind,” she said with a smile.
“Thanks. Can you show her the way back, Rir?”The ever-reliable pup barked in affirmation as he walked over to the hero, who promptly jumped on his back. It was a smooth motion, one that proved she had already long gotten used to riding him.“Alrighty then. I guess it’s time for me to get to entertaining the guests…” After watching both mount and rider head towards the dungeon, I reluctantly began to carry out my next task.***Orochi, Yata, Byakku, and Wsprit had done their jobs well. They had drawn all nearby monsters off the warwolves by engaging them in combat. Wow, is it just me, or have they gotten a lot stronger since I last saw them? Though I guess it’s only natural seeing as how Rir’s the one in charge of getting them up to speed. Man, having competent subordinates is the best thing since sliced bread.Though they were no longer being attacked, the beastkin were still on guard. Those that were still able bodied remained positioned around the perimeter of their formation, while those no longer capable of combat rested within the safety bubble created by their brethren.Much to my surprise, the warwolves were skilled in the art of detection. They noticed me coming way before I got to them; their warriors were ready with their weapons raised by the time I arrived. Oh right, now that I think about it, Lyuu’s was always kinda good at that kinda stuff too. She’s got a pretty good nose. And pretty good ears too.“Hey, over here.”I raised my voice as I stepped out from between the trees and hopped over a log for added effect. I had gone out of my way to signify that I wasn’t trying to get the jump on them, but for some odd reason, the action only seemed to put them even more on guard. Their eyes narrowed into slits as they readied themselves to jump into combat. Huh. That’s weird. I thought they’d be more chill.“Don’t let down your guard! He’s probably a monster! And I bet he’s just trying to lure us to our deaths!” shouted one of the warriors.
“Calm down man, I’m not a monster,” I said. “I’m just your everyday normal guy.”
“Do you really think we’d fall for that? Why would any normal person be all the way out here!? Do you know how dangerous this damned place is!?”Well, there goes plan A.“Alright, sure, whatever you say.” I rolled my eyes. “But you know what? It doesn’t matter what I am. Because you need my help.”Directing my gaze at the injured members of their group caused the warwolves’ expressions to twist in bitter vexation. None were as far as being on the verge of death, but some were damn well close. Individuals with deep, open gashes and missing limbs could easily be made out amongst the crowd. I suspected that they would likely die of blood loss if left untreated.“I can get you somewhere safe so you can treat all your buddies. All you gotta do is follow me. Either that, or you can sit around and watch them die. I don’t really care either way, so it’s all on you.”If they trusted me, they would also get the added benefit of reuniting with Lyuu. I wasn’t planning on truly abandoning them even if they chose to err on the side of caution. I couldn’t do that. Not to Lyuu’s family. My backup plan, which I admittedly was reluctant to go through, sounded like a major pain in the ass to pull off. It entailed joining my pets in hunting down all the monsters in the area to ensure the warwolves’ safety. Like, come on guys. Just trust me. I really don’t want to have to resort to Plan C.It was impossible for me to know whether my intentions had gotten through or not, but fortunately, the warwolves had at least chosen to consider my proposition. After a brief period of discussion, a rather young looking man stepped out of the crowd. His eyes, sharp as those of a wild animal’s, remained trained on me as he spoke.“Can we trust you?” He spoke in a tone that carried with it a sense of strength and dignity. It alone was enough to tell me that he was a warrior, and likely one of high birth.
“You already know I’d answer with a yes either way, so honestly, I don’t think what I’m about to say matters,” I said. “But yes, you can, and should, trust me. It’ll be what’s best for you.”
“…Fine.” After a brief moment of hesitation, he agreed. “Men, lower your arms.”
“Come on, boss! You don’t have to do this! We can still go on!” shouted a warrior.
“Thank you. You’re all very reliable, loyal to the bone,” said the warwolves’ leader. “But far too many of us have been injured. We will need rest if we wish to push on.”
“…Right. Got it, boss.”The leader’s judgement was not challenged any further. The pack immediately began following his orders by lowering their weapons and assisting the wounded.“So you’re the warwolf chief?” I asked, appraisingly.
“That I am. I should introduce myself. I am Vergillus Gyroll, leader of the Gyroll Pack,” he said. “Thank you for your help.”A quick peek at Vergillus’ character sheet confirmed that he was both their leader and the strongest of their warriors. He’s even got himself a fancy title. “Chief of the Warwolves,” huh? That’s pretty cool. Wait, that totally makes him Lyuu’s dad, doesn’t it?Question marks began floating around in my head as I reached the conclusion. It just didn’t make sense. Just looking at him, I wouldn’t have expected the warwolf chief to be anywhere past his twenties. Weren’t chiefs all supposed to be older men? Apparently not, I guess. Welp. There goes that trope.Wait, wait waiiiiiiiiit a second. Let’s do some quick math. Lyuu’s seventeen. If he’s thirty, then that means he’s gotta have been banging chicks since he was twelve. Or thirteen or at the latest. Holy fuck. He got laid when was thirteen!? Nononono, that can’t be right. He’s probably just baby-faced. Yeah, that’s gotta be it. I’m willing to bet that he’s actually thirty five and just looks like he’s still in his twenties. That’d mean he had her when he was eighteen. Yeah, that definitely sounds way more plausible.…But what if he isn’t?…Alright, you know what? Fuck this. I’mma just assume that he’s thirty five and stop caring.“So does that mean you’re Lyuu’s dad?”
“You know my daughter!?” The warwolf’s temper suddenly flared up at the mention of the less successful of my two maids. His expression contorted into one of violent rage. “Then you must be the Wicked Forest’s Demon Lord!”
“Yup, that’s m—”
“Curse you, Demon Lord! Consider your life forfeit!”Oh, come on…<– Prev — Next –>

Editors: Speedphoenix“Hold on, hold on! You’ve got it all wrong!”
“Give it up, demon lord! We know your villainy! Your lies will not work on us!” Lyuu’s father shouted angrily.My villainy? What? I don’t remember ever doing anything bad enough to earn me that much notoriety. At least not among the warwolves. Whatever people have been feeding him, it’s gotta be pretty bad.…Actually, I did mess up that one human town pretty badly the first time I visited it, didn’t I? Riiiiight… I totally forgot. Alright, yeah, I can kinda see where they might’ve got the idea.For a moment, I regretted not having Rir accompany me, but I soon came to the conclusion that I would have preferred the status quo over any lost opportunity cost. Because to the warwolves, Fenrirs were gods.And Rir, Fluffrir, was collared.In my defense, giving him a collar had been my way of showing the world that I saw him as a pet, a member of my family. But a moment of thought led me to understand that the warwolves would likely have seen the notion as blasphemy. To them, the choker would have looked much more like a chain, a fetter by which the one thing they worshiped was bound. Yeaaaahhh… That could have turned out pretty damn poorly. Good job, me.“Dude, calm down. Your daughter is fine. I was actually just about to bring you right to her.”
“Another lie! Say no more, demon lord! I won’t fall for your nonsense!”
“…Look, you’re going to get wiped out at this rate. Your only two choices are to let it happen or to gamble on me actually helping you. Just trust me man, it’s your only shot at making it outta here in one piece.”
“Trusting you would be no different from stabbing ourselves through the heart. We’ve been ready to lay down our lives since the moment we set out on this journey. But if we are to die, then we will die not as fools, but as warriors! We will make our stand, and we will take your head! Even if it costs us every last one of our lives!”Seriously… ? Fucking hell… After heaving a weary sigh, I once again tried to pacify the beastkin. “I don’t know who told you about me or what they said, but it was probably just over-exaggerated bullshit. Now, how about we calm down, be civil, and talk this out like men? Picking a fight with me really isn’t going to do you any goo—”My attempt at cordiality ended in total failure. Lyuu’s father dashed up to me and kicked me before I even finished speaking. I hadn’t been on guard, let alone watching him closely enough to evade the sudden strike, so his foot landed square in the middle of my chest.“Stand! Stand and fight like a man!” shouted the warwolf.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake! Fine!”The kick hadn’t dealt much in the way of damage. In fact, I’d barely felt it. But I was annoyed. Very, very annoyed. That was why I decided to employ the tool that any respectable gentleman in my position would: violence.I grabbed the dull, wooden great sword I typically used for practice out of my inventory and propped myself back up as I narrowed my eyes. You know what? I don’t even care if you’re Lyuu’s dad or whatever anymore. If you’re not feeling like acting like a sensible adult, then I’m going to beat you over the head until you are. And just for the record, you did literally ask for it.***“Yuki! You’re back!” The ball of energy I called Illuna ran up to me as soon as she spotted me.
“I see that you have returned.” Likewise, Lefi also approached, but not for the same reason. “…And what, precisely, is that?”
“Don’t ask,” I grumbled.The dragon’s gaze had been directed to the pile of bodies stacked up behind me, one that I had struggled to transport. Oh, man… rolling them into a huge ball and trying to shove all of them through the door at once was definitely not my brightest idea. I almost can’t believe I managed it, even with all my pets’ help. Note to self: Don’t follow through on violent impulses. Lugging unconscious people around is a huge pain in the ass.“Rise and shine, bossman.” After heaving the day’s nth sigh, I gave Lyuu’s dad’s a few light taps on the cheek with the back of my hand. Surely enough, he eventually began to stir.
“W-where am I…?” he groaned as he blinked his eyes into focus.
“My place. I had you brought over while you were playing sleeping beauty.”Hearing my voice seemed to lead him to realize that he was still in danger. His sleepy-looking eyes snapped open and he immediately began to shout.“You bastard! How dare you kill all my men!?”
“Dude, seriously, you need to stop jumping to conclusions,” I complained in a fed-up, exasperated tone. “Your men are fine. All I did was knock them out.”The flustered warwolf looked around in a panic. His second round of observation was far less clouded than his first. This time, he realized that I was telling the truth.“W-what happened? They’re all… healed! Even the ones with more serious wounds!”
“Seriously? You still don’t get it?” I griped. “I healed them.”I made sure that everyone with a major injury was given a potion before being shipped off.“It’s true, boss.” A man that had been missing an arm spoke up. Unlike many of his buddies, he had been too injured to fight, so he had escaped the wrath of my wooden blade. “The demon lord healed every last one of us, but only after he ruthlessly knocked out everyone that tried to challenge him.”
“I don’t understand… Why would you…” The chief of the warwolves remained in a state of confusion. It was a state he likely would have retained for much longer had his daughter not entered the scene at that exact moment.
“Here you are, Lefi! I got the snacks you were askin’ f—what the heck!?”For better or for worse, Lyuu waltzed right out of the door connected to the throne room, tray in hand.“Lyuu!? Is that really you!?”
“D-Dad!? Ughhhhhhhh… Why are you here…?”The maid was so shocked that she dropped the tray she had brought with her. Fortunately, Lefi saved it before it fell to the floor. Lyuu, please… Isn’t he supposed to be your dad? You groaning like that is almost making me feel bad for him. I mean, just look at how worried he is.“I can’t believe it! You’re okay!” The warwolf chief was so overcome with emotion that he ended up running up to the maid and catching her in a hug.
“K-knock it off already, dad! You’re embarassin’ me! Everyone’s watchin’!”
“I thought… I thought you were dead.”
“That’s horrible! Why’d you ever think something like that!? Wait! What the heck!? What’s everyone else doin’ here!? And why’re they knocked out!?”
“Yeah uhhh… My bad. That’s my fault.”
“Oh… Yeah, I can kinda see that happenin’. You’re real strong, Master.” Lyuu paused for a moment to think. “But that still doesn’t really answer my question. Why’s everyone here anyway?”Lyuu, p l s.“I… am sorry,” said Lyuu’s father, who had finally regained his cool. “It appears that I’ve had a great misunderstanding.”
“Yeah, dude. You did. You really did,” I said with a shrug. Looks like he’s finally willing to talk. God fucking damn it, that was such a pain in the ass. And it took forever. I almost want to hold a grudge, but I won’t. I’ve already beat the shit out of him—and everyone else—so I might as well forgive him. He is a part of Lyuu’s family, after all.Really makes me think though. This world doesn’t really seem to take all that kindly to demon lords, and I’m willing to bet it’s because of their behaviour. Really does beg the question of what the local demon lords have been up to. I mean, it’s obviously something. That much is evident. But what…?<– Prev — Next –>

The Gyroll Clan — Part 3
Editors: Speedphoenix, Joker“Please excuse my behaviour, I’m terribly sorry for reacting the way I did.” Lyuu’s father was situated before me with his head bowed. He sat on his legs with his knees jutting forward at an outward angle and his fists placed knuckle-down on the floor in front of him. “I was not aware that you did so much for my daughter.”It was a very warrior-like approach to apologizing. While I certainly did notice that he had gone out of his way to perform the exaggerated gesture, and I understood that it was authentic, I didn’t particularly care all that much for formalities, so I dismissed it with a shrug.“Don’t worry about it. What’s done is done.”
“I can’t apologize enough for profiling you and assuming the worst. It shames us to know that we attacked you over nothing but a misunderstanding despite you having saved Lyuu’s life.” However, the warwolf was far more fixated on etiquette, so he continued regardless. “Our actions were unjust. By all means, you deserve to be fuming with rage. But you aren’t, and for that, I thank you. I know I’ve said it many, many times already, but I must thank you. I know now that all the fault lies with the imbecile I call my daughter.”He followed up his final statement by drilling his fist into the back of Lyuu’s head.“Ow!” The maid whimpered in pain as she placed both hands on the point of impact. “That hurt, dad…”
“Shut up, you idiot! Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused? Do you know how many of our men nearly died because of what you put them through? We could have been completely obliterated if we had just made one mistake!”
“I know, I know already! And I’m real sorry I made everyone come all the way out here just to see me! But this ain’t my fault! It’s yours! I never would’ve run away from home if you didn’t keep goin’ on and on about some dumb marriage!”
“Dumb? Dumb!? There is nothing dumb about it! Lynaut is a man well worth your hand!”
“First of all, I never wanted to get married! Secondly, Lynaut’s the last person I’d ever marry! Why the heck would I wanna marry a creep ten years older than me!?”
“That’s what you find wrong with him? His age!? Open your eyes, Lyuu! Do you not see how strong and dependable he is? Lynaut has a bright future ahead of him!”
“What the heck!? You can’t be serious! He’s nothing but a stuck-up snob!”Hearing the two of them shout at each other led me to smile in a half-amused, half-exasperated manner. “Alright, you two. That’s enough. This isn’t the place for it.”I used my chin to gesture at the warwolves situated behind the two VIPs. All the men within the group were making awkward expressions that served to indicate that they had no idea what to think, do, or say.We were currently situated within one of the inn’s reception halls. While the room was certainly on the larger side, the warwolves had chosen not to flood it with bodies. Most of them had been assigned to stand by in another room whilst those higher up the social ladder joined Lyuu and her father. Going to sidetrack a little bit. Man, building this inn was the best choice I’ve ever made. It’s gotten mileage every single time I’ve had to entertain a guest. Worth/10. Would build again.Unfortunately, practicing escapism failed to end the argument between the parent and child. In fact, neglecting them and allowing my mind to drift had only seemed to make things worse—the pair had somehow gotten even further away from reaching a compromise.“Lynaut ain’t all that strong either! Master crushed all o’ you at the same time even though he was tryin’ not to hurt anyone!”The warwolf chief grimaced as he clutched his chest in a display of agony. His daughter’s attack on his psyche had been so precise that it had apparently managed to do him physical harm.“Hey, Lyuu? You mind doing me a favour and not dragging me into this?”
“While I must admit that Yuki is certainly a splendid warrior, your point isn’t of any relevance.” My plea fell on deaf ears. Even her father continued to include me in the conversation.
“No it’s not!”
“Yes, it is! Unlike Lynaut, Yuki is not your fiance! Nor are you romantically involved with him!”This time, it was Lyuu who winced in the face of the other party’s argument. Come on, guys… Do I really need to be brought into this? Because it feels like I don’t.“Whatever the case, you’re coming home. I can not let you impose on Yuki any more than you already have, and everyone that has stayed behind in the village is still worried about you.”
“No way! I don’t want to leave! I want to stay here, with all my friends!”
“Stop acting like such a spoiled brat! You can’t have everything you want!”
“I’m not acting like a brat! It’s my life dad, not yours!”God fucking damn it… It didn’t seem like they were going to stop anytime soon, so I decided to step in after heaving a heavy sigh. The first person I turned towards was Lyuu’s father.“I said that’s enough. Stop screaming already, for fuck’s sake. Did you really come all the way here just to get into some silly argument?”
“…I apologize. That was an unsightly display we should have kept behind closed doors.”The warwolf chief finally seemed to realize how rude he was being, as he once again bowed his head in apology after correcting his posture.“And that goes for you too, Lyuu.” After dealing with her dad, I directed my gaze at the maid. “You were going on and on about how you weren’t at fault, but you totally are. None of this would’ve happened if you told me the truth from the start.”
“Erk…. I-I’m sorry, Master.” Lyuu wasn’t able to come up with any sort of argument, so she reluctantly ended up apologizing.I turned to face her father again after breathing the yet another sigh.“Alright, so I’m totally sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong right now, but whatever,” I said. “I know I just said that this whole incident is Lyuu’s fault, but her opinion matters a lot more to me than yours does, so I’m going to be taking her side. By that, I mean I’m not going to let you drag her home against her will.”
“What…?” The chief’s eyes narrowed into a glare, but I ignored him and kept talking.
“She really should’ve at least popped in to say hi and show everyone that she was still alright. Hell, I was planning on making her visit whether she liked it or not. But that’s it. If she wants to stay here, then I’m going to have her do exactly that. Stay. I’m not going to force her to leave just because her old man decided to come a knocking. Not unless it’s what she wants.”
“I knew you’d understand, Master.”Apparently, my declaration had moved Lyuu to the verge of tears. The gaze she directed at me was filled with trust.“I mean, it just wouldn’t make any sense for me to let her go. She’s finally started figuring this whole maid thing out. If she leaves now, we’ll have nothing to show for all the time we wasted onboarding her.”Plus, she’s only been here at Demon Lord Inc. for about a year. This is her first job, so it’d probably be best for her to stay at least three. As far as Japanese companies go, most hiring managers assume that anyone that leaves their first job before they get three years of experience is probably incompetent. Leaving now will probably hurt her future prospects.“C-come on, Master! Why do you always gotta make fun of me!?”
“Why? Because bullying you is hilarious, of course.”
“W-what the heck!?” Her jaw dropped. See, that’s exactly what I mean.
“I was just messing with you,” I said with a shiteating grin. “Don’t worry, Lyuu, you’re just as important to me as everyone else that lives here.”After chuckling a bit more, I turned towards her father. “Oh, and just so we’re clear, that whole me keeping her here thing wasn’t a part of the joke.”
“…Are you telling me that you won’t allow a course of action as natural as allowing a child to return to her parents’ home?”
“More or less, yeah. Because I’d definitely miss her. Hell, it’s not just me. Everyone else that lives here would miss her too,” I said. “Besides, she’s already made her intentions clear. She said that she wanted to stay, so I’m going to make it happen no matter what you say.”The opposite was true too. I would have let Lyuu go if that was what she wanted, even if it meant that the dungeon would feel like it was missing something without her.“Lyuu’s already old enough to make her own decisions, isn’t she? What’s wrong with letting her make her own decisions?”
“That is not the warwolf way. Our people have thrived by trusting in their parents’ decisions even well into adulthood,” he said. “Lyuu is unwed. It is only right for us to dictate her future—and choose her partner. I have no intention of letting her go simply because she is no longer a child. I will be taking her home.”What the fuck? And here I thought I was a self-serving prick. But this guy? He takes the whole goddamn cake.“You think I give a shit about your stupid culture?” I scoffed and rolled my eyes. “I don’t care about your, or any, tribe’s customs. Your dumb traditions can go eat shit for all I care.”Apparently, he didn’t like how blunt I was. His face twitched in annoyance.“I respect you Yuki. You’ve saved my daughter’s life. My people and I owe you an irreparable debt. But this is something I can and will not yield on. Please understand.”
“Debt, shebt. I never cared about that shit to begin with. You think I saved you because I wanted you to owe me? Fuck no. I only did it because you’re Lyuu’s people. I probably would’ve just sat around and watched you die if you weren’t. Because, honestly, your dumb ass deserves it,” I spat, venomously. “I don’t care what you think. I wasn’t trying to suggest anything or give you any ideas. I was just telling you how this was going to go. You’re not having her back.”Tension filled the air as we stared each other down in silence. It was a contest, a demonstration of our will.And he was the first to break.“…I see.” The chief of the warwolves closed his eyes and slowly breathed in and out before reopening them. “If neither of us is willing to compromise, then we have no choice but to butt heads.”Again, he paused and took a breath. One that dripped with resolve.“We shall settle this matter through single combat!”<– Prev — Next –>

Duel – part 1
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“That sounds like an awful idea, dad. You ain’t even close to bein’ a match for Master,” said Lyuu.
“You’ll never know if you don’t try, Lyuu,” lectured her father.
“But you already did try…” She wasn’t very amused by her father’s antics. “Master beat you guys up pretty bad even though he was tryin’ not to hurt you.”The warwolf chief humphed and turned towards the man sitting beside him as if encouraging him to give his opinion.“I am afraid that I do have to take milady’s side on this one, boss. We’ve lost any reason to be hostile. Lyuu is safe. I understand that you have your own thoughts and feelings on the matter, but I think that you should just leave her be, seeing as she’s both alive and happy.”
“Shut up, Bijgal! You know you would do the same if you were in my position!” He crossed his arms and effectively roared in a display of stubbornness, a display that caused both his daughter and the man I assumed to be his aide to sigh.
“Thanks for trying, Bijgal, and sorry my dad’s such a blockhead.” The exasperated pair began walking in my direction as they aired their grievances.
“Don’t be. I’ve long accustomed myself to the boss’ ways. It’s why he trusts me as his advisor,” said Bijgal. “Don’t worry too much about everything that the boss is saying. We’re all grateful to see that you’re still alive.”The first thing Lyuu did upon reaching me was apologize. “Uhmm… I’m real sorry about my dad, Master.”
“I don’t really mind,” I said with a shrug. “This works better for me than sitting around arguing all day anyway. Especially if it’ll actually drill the goddamn point into that stupidly thick skull of his.”We left the inn shortly after the exchange in order to get the duel underway and over with. Our destination? The grasslands, of course. I spent some DP and spawned an arena in order to host the event and provide us with some proper boundaries. It wasn’t anything particularly fancy; I went with one of the cheapest options available. Unlike the dungeon’s residents, the warwolves hadn’t expected the stage to suddenly appear out of thin air. The reactions that followed its sudden appearance were filled with so much genuine surprise that I couldn’t help but snicker like the haughty bastard I was. Heh.Dueling Lyuu’s dad wasn’t something I felt, by any means, obligated to do. That said, warwolves seemed to be the type of race that prioritized strength over all else, so I decided to abide by their cultural norms and show off a bit, just to get the point across in a way that they would understand. And vent a bit of frustration because Lyuu’s dad is kind of a piece of shit and I kind of want to kick his ass again anyway.The dungeon’s residents seemed to regard the duel as a special event of sorts, one whose purpose was clearly, clearly, entertainment and entertainment alone. Leila had not only busted out the picnic sheet, but also decked it in a whole slew of homemade treats. Even Nell had nonchalantly started to dig in. Would you look at that? She’s already fitting in. Guess she must be getting pretty used to this whole dungeon life thing.“Yuki, sir, I’m terribly sorry about our chief. Please know that, while he is our representative, this isn’t, by any means, how we as a people feel about everything you’ve done for us. I would just like to take the chance to apologize once again before the boss completely ruins your impression of us.”The so-called advisor, a warwolf who looked to be in his prime, bowed as he joined Lyuu in ridiculing her father’s behaviour.“Honestly, it doesn’t really matter all that much to me,” I said. “There is one thing I’m kinda curious about though.”
“And what would that be, good sir?”
“How old are you right now?”
“Me? I happen to be sixty as of this year.”Wut?That can’t be right. He looks like he’s around forty.I realized, upon scanning the surroundings, that many of the other warriors looked to be in about the same age group. Does that make all of them 60 too? Maybe looking younger than you are is just a warwolf thing?“How old does that make the chief?”
“I think he’s around 40,” said Lyuu.40? No way. No fuckin’ way.“Is it just me, or do all of you look a good bit younger than you really are?”
“That’s just how we warwolves, er, beastkin, are, Master. We live longer than humans. It takes us longer to get old too.”So what you’re saying is that you’re basically elves? God damn, that’s some high tier fantasy bullshit right there. Man, this really is another world, isn’t it? Well, I mean, of course it is. But Oh man, that’s a thought I haven’t had in ages.Though I found myself lost in thought, I didn’t end up missing out on any part of the conversation. Lyuu had also momentarily paused to prepare her next words.“Uhm… Master, I know it isn’t my place to tell you what to do, and I know that my dad’s a stubborn idiot, but he’s still my dad. And my tribe is still my tribe. So I’d be real grateful if you didn’t kill anyone…”
“Relax, Lyuu. Don’t worry. I don’t plan on losing you. But I’m not going to kill any of your friends or relatives either,” I said. “Just head on over to where everyone else is, sit down, kick back, and relax. This’ll be over before you know it.”Her cheeks reddened a bit as she gave me a bit of a bow before heading over and joining the rest of my family. Speaking of…“Do your best, Yuki!” cheered Illuna.
“Yeah! Do your best!” echoed Shii.
“No losing,” said Enne.
“Don’t worry. I got this!” I appeased the crowd with a grin.
“Let it be known that I am sure to mock you should you manage an unsightly display,” said Lefi.
“Yeah! Don’t do anything too silly!” added Nell.
“Woooow girls, thanks soooo much for cheering me on. I’m glad you’ve both got my back,” I said as I rolled my eyes.The only individual who had remained silent throughout the exchange was Leila. She had quietly watched it all unfold with one of her usual smiles.“You aren’t taking this seriously, are you?” asked Lyuu’s father as his eyes narrowed into a glare.
“Was I supposed to?” I asked, casually. “I didn’t have much trouble beating you guys up last time, and nothing’s changed, sooooo…”
“…You certainly do have a point,” he said with a wince. “But that means nothing!”X. Doubt.The warwolves had proven themselves inferior even to many of the forest’s weaker denizens. Even as a coordinated group, they failed to stand up to the monsters’ primal violence; many of them were injured in their encounters.It wasn’t as if I was personally capable of defeating everything that lurked within the Wicked Forest. Many monsters powerful enough to thoroughly destroy me lay within its depths. But that didn’t mean I was weak. I was still far more powerful than the monsters that had crushed them underfoot. So much so, in fact, that I suspected I could handle any number of them with ease.“Right, so about this whole duel thing. Were you going to fight? Or did you have a proxy lined up?”
“I would have loved to do it myself, but the honour belongs to another,” grumbled Lyuu’s father. “Lynaut!”
“Right here, boss!”The man who stepped forward and entered the space between the chief and I had a much larger build than any other. Wait, Lynaut…? So he was the one Lyuu’s dad was trying to set her up with? Yeah, I can see why she ran away from home.If there was one thing I learned from interacting with warwolves, it was that dog ears did not work well on anyone with male genitalia. They worked on Lyuu. Her ears were adorable. But seeing near-identical structures on big, burly warriors filled me with the urge to throw up everything I had for lunch. Any artist willing to illustrate a battle-hardened male warwolf likely would have been heralded as a heaven-sent genius destined to portray the grotesque.“Yuki! I thank you! You saved many of us, myself included, from the verge of death!” His loud, booming voice almost seemed to resemble that of an over-enthused gym teacher. It was disciplined, and yet somehow naggy and obtuse.
“No problem,” I said. He’s one of the ones I healed? I guess that means he must’ve been one of the ones that almost got himself killed by some weak ass monster. No wonder I don’t remember beating him up. He was already down for the count before I started swinging.
“But do not be mistaken! I have not forgiven you for fooling my fiancee with your trickery!”>Trickery
I mean, I get where you’re coming from. It probably feels like you got cucked. But still, you can’t be serious. What kind of self-serving bullshit is that?While I wasn’t a fan, I could see why Lyuu’s dad had taken a liking to the weird jock that was Lynaut. And why Lyuu wanted to stay as far away from him as she could. The amount he shouted could have potentially made him come off as equal parts intimidating and obnoxious. Intimidation was a survival mechanism, one that suited this world well.Those with loud voices, be they figurative or literal, distinguished themselves from the crowd. They appeared more reliable, and it was easy for people to see them as beacons around which they could gather.“I cannot allow you to manipulate the woman who will be my wife any longer, Demon Lord! And that is why I challenge you to single combat!”
“Suuuure.”
“Lyuu, milady, watch carefully! Watch as the man you will soon wed demonstrates the extent of his valour!”
“Wow, Lyuu. Someone sure seems popular,” I said.
“Good for you, Lyuu!” added Illuna.
“Why the heck would anyone wanna be popular with guys like that!?” shouted the maid. “And stop callin’ me your future wife! It’s givin’ me the creeps!”
“It’s okay, Lyuu! I understand you! You’re just far too pure a maiden to fess up to your feelings! You’re only putting up a front to hide your embarrassment!” shouted Mr. Fit. “Can you understand her, Yuki!? Can you hear her heart whisper its truest desires!?”
“Nope. I’ve got no idea what you’re going on about. And frankly, I don’t really care.”
“And that is why you are not worthy of her! A real man would be able to see right through her!”Wow, uh… I honestly can’t tell if he’s really optimistic or just downright retarded.“…Sure, whatever you say. Anyway, enough of that. Pick up your weapon so I can finish dealing with your dumb ass.”I was getting tired of his shit, so I made sure to throw in a taunt as I grabbed my weapon and assumed a casual, one-handed stance—if you could even call it that. My ‘stance’ was so sloppy that it looked even less impressive than what one might see in a third rate B movie.He wasn’t using a training weapon. Under normal circumstances, I would have opted to equip Enne, but I ended up resorting to the wooden greatsword I had used earlier in the day because I didn’t want to run the risk of accidentally killing him. Now that I think about it, I could’ve just used her and kept her sheathed, but it’s a bit too late for that. She’s already settled down on top of the picnic sheet with everyone else. Oh well.“Finish dealing with me!? Do not underestimate me! Use a real weapon! Take me seriously!”
“Nah, I’m good,” I said. “This wooden sword right here is courtesy of Lyuu. You should really thank her once all this is over. For saving your life, that is.”
“Fine!” He grumbled, angrily. “Prove to me that you’re more than just all bark!”With a battle cry, Mr. Fit raised his spear and began dashing right at me.<– Prev — Next –>

Duel — Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“My rival… was far… too powerful…for me… to overcome…” Mr. Fit delivered a line as he collapsed in an overdramatic fashion—he stretched an arm out towards me as he fell to his knees, then onto his face.Ten-odd seconds had been all I needed to deprive him of the ability to move.Although his statement had almost sounded like a series of last words, they were, in truth, far from them. His character sheet indicated that he still had about a third of his health. Yeah, he’s probably just unconscious. If he was really dying, he wouldn’t have bothered with all the theatrics.Wait, he just called me his rival. Yeah, uh, no. Can we not?Lyuu’s father, who had been watching the duel from just outside the ring, clicked his tongue and shouted in frustration, “I can’t believe it! He wasn’t even able to lift a finger!”This is going to sound kinda cocky coming from me given that I just won, but honestly, what did you expect to happen? After sighing to myself, I began to reflect on the differences between this world and my last. One of the most notable was the creatures. Those that resided here were far more powerful. Myself included. I was confident, but not overconfident. I knew that there existed both creatures with stats that far eclipsed mine and true masters capable of pulling me off my high horse with skill and skill alone.The year I had spent in this world had forced me to gradually adapt to it. I too had become capable of putting up a fair fight. But in the end, I relied more on stats than I did martial prowess. It didn’t matter whether I chose to employ might or magic. In the end, I was still relying on brute force.Still, I wasn’t going to fall to some nameless warrior.“It appears I don’t have any other choice.” Again, the warwolf chief clicked his tongue. “Come, Demon Lord! I will take care of you myself!”I wasn’t the only one that found the old dog’s whining annoying. Even his men began to jeer and boo as he engaged in the shameless act of asking for a second duel the moment his proxy failed him.“Shut up! Do you really think I can go home empty-handed after all this!?” He shouted at his underlings before turning back to face me. “Well, Yuki? Are you enough of a man to rise to the challenge?”
“Ehhh… I mean, fine, sure, whatever. But only if you’ll actually shut up once we’re done.”
“Hah! Let us see how far that hubris of yours will take you!” snorted the warwolf.***The result of our duel was nothing if not obvious.“Not… like… this…”The chief had lost the ability to rise to his feet. The knee he had on the ground was so weak that it was incapable of supporting his upper body. He had to prop himself up against his fang-like blade just to keep himself from collapsing. His breaths were ragged. Every pant that left his throat was laced with alternating waves of pain and exhaustion.While he wasn’t a match for me, Lyuu’s dad had at least proven himself a more worthy foe than Mr. Fit. His movements were much swifter; his attacks were more complicated and required more effort to read. But that was it. Unlike the old butler, who had used his blade to carve himself into my memory, the warwolf was nothing special. He wasn’t even able to pressure me.“Give it up. You can’t win,” I said. “Hell, you don’t even come close to standing a chance. I could take on an army of people just like you and not break a sweat.”
“Give it up? Give it up!? You think I can just give up!?” He started with a low, spiteful growl, one that quickly morphed to a hate-fueled scream. “Do you have any idea how I feel!? My daughter went missing! Next I heard of her, she was working as a maid for a man, a demon lord, I know nothing about! And she thinks she’s happy!? What absolute nonsense!”Only then did I finally come to understand why he was being so insistent.It was because he was a father.He wasn’t just being stubborn.He was showing that he cared.He was trying to do what he thought was best for his daughter.That was why he was willing to endure any amount of physical harm, permanent damage and potential side effects be damned.That was why he was willing to throw away his pride, even before his men.That was why their jeers failed to change his mind.And that was why he was now desperately trying to push himself to his feet.It was all for his daughter.And as a man with girls of my own, I understood him.I understood that I would have done the same.“Listen…”
“Shut up! I don’t want to hear another word out of you!”My voice only served to fuel his rage and encourage him to tighten the grip he had on his weapon. But it wasn’t all bad. His eyes were locked on me, which meant he didn’t miss the moment I retrieved a dagger from my inventory and used it to slit open my thumb.“Now pass me yours,” I held the bloody digit forward, presenting it to him.
“…What are you playing at?”
“I’m making a vow. Isn’t this how you warwolves do it?”My knowledge of the ceremony came from Lyuu. While I didn’t remember the exact circumstances involved, I did remember that she mentioned that this was how warwolves made promises. I don’t think she actually went through with it though. Mostly because whatever she swore wasn’t actually all that important. This though…“I swear that I will keep your daughter safe from all possible harm, regardless of the circumstances. I’ll drive away every threat to her safety imaginable, even if it means putting my life on the line. And throwing it away.”
“…Are you serious?”
“Yeah. I am,” I said. “Lyuu is just as precious and irreplaceable to me as she is to you. I can’t even begin to think what life without her would be like anymore.”It was true.Lyuu had become a key part of my life.Even the thought of considering that she might suddenly vanish filled me with an emotion so disagreeable I could only call it dread.“And I swear that I will do everything in my power to allow her to enjoy life to its fullest.”Silence followed.Neither he nor I spoke.But the exchange continued.He stared at me, and I at him. His purpose was to discern my intentions. Mine was to convey them. That was why I refused to recoil. I simply stood there with my hand outstretched, even as my blood dripped down my hand and onto the floor below.And in the end, he chose to trust me.“…I understand.” He slit his own thumb and pushed it forward as he finally managed to get back to his feet. “But is that something you can truly swear even knowing that I’ll do everything in my power to make you suffer if you fail to follow through on your promise?”
“Yeah. It is. I’ll say it as many times as you want me to. Lyuu will be safe here. No matter what.”
“Fine.” He dragged himself over and pushed his bloody thumb against mine. “Repeat after me.”
“Sure.”
“I make this oath upon the blood of my ancestors. And if it is broken, their vital fluids are to be purged from my veins.”
“I make this oath upon the blood of my ancestors. And if it is broken, their vital fluids are to be purged from my veins,” I repeated.
“…Then my daughter is yours. You’ve proven yourself both a worthy warrior. And a worthy man,” he said. “But never forget your vow. If you break her heart, my ancestors and I will have you plagued by curses.”
“Yeah, that sounds kinda terrifying, so I’ll make sure I don’t.”
“Hmph.” He dismissed my gag with a snort. “Then I will allow you to wed my daughter.”His tone made it obvious that he wasn’t proposing the idea. It was something that, at least in his mind, was already fact.I, however, didn’t share the sentiment. Wait. What? What the fuck just happened?“I will be visiting in a year to make sure that you’ve done as promised.”Dude. Wait. Hold the fucking phone. I’ve got a ton of things to say about this. First and foremost? Not this shit again.<– Prev — Next –>

Duel — Part 3
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerAlright Yuki, calm down. Let’s just take a deep breath and evaluate the situation. The first question I have to ask myself is: How exactly did all this happen? I’m going to go out on a limb and assume it was probably something I said.I mean, I don’t think I said anything too weird. All I did was say what any manager would say and tell Lyuu’s father that I valued her. And that I would lay down my life to prote—I’m a fucking idiot.Only after reflecting on my actions did I realize that I had effectively proposed.“I believe that is the expression he wears upon realizing that he is at fault,” said Lefi.
“That’s exactly what I was thinking,” said Nell. “Yuki’s pretty easy to read.”
“He certainly is,” said Leila, “My Lord’s expressions tend to be fairly easy to read outside of critical situations”
“H-hold on, gimme just one sec!”I held up my hand and asked for him to stop as I dashed towards the rest of my family. Unlike me, they were calm, collected, and treating my mistake as just more of the usual.“That really didn’t work out the way I thought it would! What the hell am I supposed to do now!?”
“As one who bore witness to the event, I fail to see why this outcome exceeds your expectations,” said Lefi.
“I know, right?” said Nell. “You totally just proposed!”Both girls responded with exasperation. Their fed up expressions made it clear that they were judging me.“That’s not what I meant! I was speaking from the perspective of a manager!”
“Your intentions are irrelevant. You should have either made yourself clear or corrected the understanding before swearing your pledge. Now, it is too late,” said Lefi. “He is a stubborn man, one likely to throw a fit of rage should you attempt to recant your vow.”She was right. Pacifying Lyuu’s father had been a huge pain in the ass, and taking back my words now of all times was sure to negate all of my efforts.“Well, Yuki, that’s just what you get for being so dense and careless,” said Nell.
“I concur. While you certainly appear to be fairly reliable, it is rather characteristic of you to make silly mistakes.”
“But that’s exactly what you love about him, right Lefi?” giggled Nell.
“S-Shut up. You are no different.”
“I can’t argue with you there.”Girls, please. Can we not? This is way too embarrassing a topic for a time like this.“What’s wrong with making Lyuu another one of your wives, Yuki?” asked Illuna, innocently.
“Yay! The more the merrier!” said Shii.Ms. Vampire, we need to talk. Wives aren’t objects or belongings. You can’t just randomly get more of them. That’s just not how that works.After a bit of internal musing, I finally decided to timidly glance in Lyuu’s direction. I assumed she was mad at me. She had remained silent with her cheeks red throughout the duration of the conversation. Her eyes peeked up at me every once in a while, but her gaze remained downcast. It was almost like she was expecting me to say or do something.“Hey, Lyuu?”
“B-Bat is hit, Master?” She fumbled over her words.
“Are you mad?”
“A-About what?”
“Just, you know, about all this happening without your consent.”
“No, uhm… Not really.” She shook her head before continuing in a voice that only grew quieter with every word. “I’m really happy you think so much of me, Master. And I uhm… feel that way about you too.”Bruh. You srs? The reaction I got out of her was just about the last I had expected. Oh man, this must be what it’s like to be popular with the ladies. I guess it really does happen to everyone eventually. Ahahahahaha. Hahaha. Haha. Ha. Fuck.It wasn’t like I disliked Lyuu. She was pretty, fun, and easy to get along with. I knew I could cut loose around her and just be myself. But I had long hit the wife cap. Getting a second had put me over it. Three was way more than I could possibly handle.“So uh… got any opinions on this, Lefi?” I immediately sought refuge in the form of a refusal.
“I do not mind. She is no stranger to me and you have proven, with this display, that you are worthy of her,” said the dragon, indifferently.
“W-what about you, Nell?”My first magazine proved itself empty, so I immediately loaded a second.“If you and Lefi are both fine with it, then I am too. Besides, you’ve known her for much longer than you’ve known me. And I’m in part only still here right now because of her goodwill, so I couldn’t possibly say no.”Shiiiiit. Alright, third time’s the charm.I looked around the room in a desperate attempt to find another card to play. But there weren’t any. Leila was smiling along as if none of this was any of her business. She wasn’t going to be of much help. The kids, on the other hand, were far too innocent to understand the implications of marriage. As far as they were concerned, all that mattered was that everyone was together forever, which meant they would definitely have supported the strengthening of our ties.Oh, fuck it! I don’t care anymore. Two? Three? There ain’t no goddamn difference. Fuck fighting it. I give up. At this point, I might as well just catch ’em all. “Lyuu.” I said her name in a strong, commanding tone, much like that of a drill sergeant.
“Y-Yeah?”
“You’re staying right here in this dungeon forever, and enjoying every moment of it. Got it?”
“G-got it, Master! I’ll be by your side forever!”
“Alright, next question. You okay with marrying me?”
“Totally, Master! I’d love to be one of your wives!”
“Okay, that’s two for two,” I said. “Now get the hell over here.”She squealed in a derpy display of surprise as I pulled her into a hug before picking her up, princess style. One of my arms was poised under her knees, while the other was wrapped around her back.“U-Uhm, Master, this is real embarrassin’…”
“Shut up. Stop complaining.”She looked up at me with her face dyed a deep shade of scarlet. She was begging to be put down, but I ignored her and walked back over to the ring with her still in my arms.“Well, I guess this means we’ve reached an agreement. Lyuu’s mine now.”
“…Very well.” He paused for a moment. “Lyuu.”Though his words were directed towards his daughter, his eyes remained focused on me.“Y-yeah, dad?”
“You’re free to come home if you ever get sick of him. But never forget that this is the path you chose yourself. I won’t let you go back on your word without good reason.”
“I know, dad. It’s okay… I’m not a kid anymore. I understand what I’m askin’ for here. I won’t change my mind. Not now, not ever.” Her cheeks remained a shade of red, but she spoke in a serious tone. “This is somethin’ I decided a long time ago. I want to live here. With Master and all the others. The village isn’t my home anymore, dad. This is.”Lyuu’s father closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Only after a few moments did he slowly open them once more.“I understand. I will speak to Lynaut, and all the others, and ensure that they accept this decision. Our decision,” he said. “I’ve already said this to that husband of yours, but I will come again to check on you in a year. Do your best to make sure you grow into your new role by the time that comes to pass.”Lyuu’s expression brightened. A big smile appeared on her face as her father voiced his approval.“Okay! Thanks dad!”
He finally turned his gaze away from the two of us as he humphed. “What an exhausting day. It’s been nothing but one unexpected occurrence after another.”
“You’re welcome to stay at the inn if you want. You guys are basically my in-laws now, so I’ll make sure we give you a nice, warm welcome.”
“Thank you. We’ll gladly accept the offer,” he said. “And as a man about to see his daughter off, I would appreciate the chance to sit down and share a drink with the man who has become her husband.”
“Sure. Can’t really say no to the in-laws, after all,” I said with a shrug.
“No, I don’t suppose you can,” said the warwolf, with a bit of a reluctant smile.And that was how I ended up with yet another wife. Wow, uh, is it just me, or does that statement seem kinda fucked up?<– Prev — Next –>

Fatherhood — Part 1
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerIt was late into the night. The moon was out and the stars glimmering upon the rural city of Alfyro. And yet, many of its alleyways remained unlit.A pair of men dwelled within one such backstreet. One was hooded. He wore it so low it covered his eyes. But not his identity. His dog-like ears could still be seen even underneath the thick fabric. The other appeared much more like a local. His outfit was near indiscernible from that of any other hoodlum’s. The most attention-grabbing part of the second man was not the rag he wore, however, but rather the mark upon his face. It was swollen, near twice its regular size.“Well? Are you going to talk? Or do you need more convincing?” The beastkin, Vergillus Gyroll, looked upon his conversational partner with scorn.With his back to the wall and more pain on the horizon, the human had no choice but to speak. Every detail he could think of leaked from his mouth as he rambled.“Ay man, I don’t know nuffin specific! All I gots for ya is that the guys that used to run this hood got crushed by some demon lord and the dragons he was keeping!”
“Why would a demon lord attack this, of all places?”
“Man, I don’t know how real this is ’cause it’s just the word on the street, but everyone says he went crazy and started killing people left and ’cause some moron kidnapped his daughter!”The explanation led Vergillus to scoff as he once again reflected on the insatiable greed that was humanity’s nature. Performing an action as dangerous as kidnapping a demon lord’s daughter proved that they were far beyond help.The humans, however, were not the only target of his contempt. Demon lords were as well. The two were equally stupid. While the former simply lacked the foresight to see the consequences of their actions, the latter never considered them to begin with. demon lords were too drunk on power to even know the meaning of restraint.A conflict between the two was so fitting it could also be called poetic.“So he crushed them? What happened to beastkin, no, all the inhuman slaves they kept?”
“Shiiiet, mang, that ain’t something you gunna be happy to hear, but one of my boys, he saw it happen. The demon lord took them. He loaded them up onto the dragons when he was taking his daughter home.”In other words, the humans had offered their slaves as sacrifices. They had given the girls up to the demon lord in an attempt to save their own skin. And Vergillus’ daughter, Lyuuin, had undoubtedly been amongst them.“Where can I find this demon lord?”
“I can’t say, mang, I ain’t got nuttin real on that. Only thing I know is that they hit us up from the north, so they probably up in that Wicked Forest hood.”The Wicked Forest was a place that Vergillus had heard of. He knew that, if his people wished to raid, they would first have to ensure that they were well equipped. The preparations would consume many resources. But he had to go.He recognized that his opinion could have potentially been skewed by bias, but he felt that his daughter was one that most would consider beautiful. Even the demon lord. And demon lords were as unrestrained in their lust as they were everything else. It didn’t take much for him to guess the fate that befell her. It was a fate that filled him with such rage that he clenched his fangs hard enough to draw his own blood.“T-That’s it, aight? ‘Cause I don’t know nuttin more. Now lemme go already!”Vergillus found himself annoyed by the human’s annoying whining, so he gave him one last punch to knock him out before turning and exiting the alley.He had accomplished his goal and located his daughter. It was time for him to leave the city. As a warwolf, Vegillus’ night vision was far superior to any human’s. But he knew better than to remain in enemy territory. Wasting time would only put his men in unnecessary danger.“Just wait, Lyuu… Your father is coming.”Vergillus clenched his fist as he hurried back to where his men were awaiting his return.***“We will break through! Trust your allies, and trust yourself! But don’t fight alone! Work together!” Vergillus shouted a mix of orders and encouragement as he swung his magic blade and cut down a nearby monster.It, Wolf Fang, was a relatively well-known weapon, one that his people often referred to as the Cuspid Blade. Its reputation as a contingency used only in times of war was well deserved; it had demonstrated its efficacy throughout the generations as it was passed from one chief to another. Vergillus had brought it along as a contingency. And yet, he still felt woefully underprepared.He knew that the Wicked Forest was where the legendary Supreme Dragon resided. And he knew that it was far too dangerous to be claimed by any. But still, he had greatly underestimated it. Though he had yet to fully explore it, he was made painfully aware that warwolves stood nowhere near the top of the forest’s food chain.Most other monster-infested territories revolved around apex predators, individuals that were much more powerful than all others in the area, regardless of species. Under normal circumstances, there would be exactly one monster of this calibre in every zone. But the Wicked Forest was different. All of the Wicked Forest’s creatures were powerful enough to take over ecosystems and become their apex predators should they leave their natural habitats.The warwolves had only spent a single day within the forest’s confines. But they were already riddled with casualties. A third of the warriors Vergillus brought with him had been injured, and some had been hurt so badly that they were no longer capable of moving. It was only a matter of time before they were wiped out.He noticed that the number of monsters in the warwolves’ vicinity began decreasing right as the thought crossed his mind. Soon, the lull hit its apex. Every nearby monster seemed to have vanished altogether.It was the perfect opportunity for him to sift through his thoughts and evaluate his options. So he did.He wanted to save his daughter. As soon as possible. But although he didn’t want to admit it, he knew there might not be anything left for him to save. There was no guarantee that she was still alive.His men, however, were. They had immediately agreed to his proposal even though they knew the risks. They had claimed that it was their duty to follow through on their chief’s orders. They were good men. And that was precisely why he didn’t want to lose them in the pursuit of a faint hope.Vergillus needed to carry out his duty as chief and order a retreat.It was a decision he likely would have made even if he had prioritized his own desires over his warriors’ wellbeing. Their formation had collapsed. His fighters needed to heal before they could once again tackle the forest’s dangers.The chief readied himself to announce his decision but was interrupted before he could. By a voice that he did not recognize.“Hey, over here.”Every warrior’s head turned in the speaker’s direction almost immediately.He immediately identified the man as a demon. One of his eyes glowed red, while the other shared the same peculiar colour as the hair that adorned the young man’s head: black. His features were odd, but they weren’t nearly as suspicious as his complete and utter lack of equipment. The demon was in the midst of the Wicked Forest, one of the most ridiculously dangerous places known to any sentient being. And yet, he was dressed in casual wear. He didn’t have any protective gear, nor any weapons at the ready. He didn’t even have a spell or two standing by; his magical energies appeared to be in an idle state.Vergillus was baffled. He couldn’t help but suspect that the demon either bore a deathwish or was so incredibly powerful that he didn’t need to remain on guard even when pitted against the forest’s endless onslaught.Warwolves, like all other beastkin, had incredibly sharp senses. They could tell if an individual was hostile by taking in their scent, observing the extent of their perspiration, reading their expressions, and watching their muscles. And though he seemed suspicious, Vergillus knew that he wasn’t hostile.The demon’s words seemed to indicate that he would be able to get the warwolves somewhere safe, somewhere the monsters would never reach. And that he had intentionally initiated contact to make the offer.Vergillus didn’t know if he could trust the demon, but at the very least, his words seemed true. His lack of equipment served to prove that he really did know an area that could be considered safe. And it was likely his base of operations. Or maybe, just maybe, his home. It seemed completely unbelievable. It made little sense for one to choose to live within the Wicked Forest. Vergillus understood that well, as he had already had its terror permanently engraved into his mind.His tale would have been much more believable if the demon was a seasoned warrior. But he didn’t look the part. Of course, the warwolf knew not to judge others by appearances. Especially demons, as they often were not what they looked to be.Of course, the demon’s proficiency in battle had nothing to do with his trustworthiness. There was still no guarantee that he truly intended to help.That was why the warwolf pondered his options. He momentarily brooded as he tried to choose between refusing and accepting the other man’s offer. If he chose the former, he would have no choice but to retreat whilst incurring losses. If he chose the latter, however, there was a chance that he could do away with any losses before they occurred.And that wasn’t the only benefit.If the demon was truly a local, then there was a chance that he would know about the demon lord.After a brief moment of silence, the chief came to a decision. He pushed his way through the ranks and approached the demon.“Can we trust you?”
“You already know I’d answer with a yes either way, so honestly, I don’t think what I’m about to say matters. But yes, you can, and should, trust me. It’ll be what’s best for you.”Watching the demon shrug made Vergillus chuckle to himself.The man had a point. And as he didn’t sense any hostility from him, he saw no reason to doubt him. There was, of course, the off chance that the demon was simply skilled in the art of masking his intentions, but Vergillus chose not to consider it. He knew that being overly suspicious would get him nowhere.“…Fine. Men, lower your arms.”
“Come on, boss! You don’t have to do this. We can still go on!”One of his men immediately objected to the decision. But rather than get angry him, Vergillus did exactly the opposite. He was filled with a sense of pride.“Thank you. You’re all very reliable, loyal to the bone. But far too many of us have been injured. We will need rest if we wish to push on.”
“…Right. Got it, boss.”With the sole dissenter pacified, the warwolves immediately got to work. They got ready to move.“So you’re the warwolf chief?” the demon raised an eyebrow as he asked the question.
“That I am. I should introduce myself. I am Vergillus Gyroll, leader of the Gyroll Pack. Thank you for your help,” said the warwolf with a nod.
“So does that mean you’re Lyuu’s dad?” The words that came out of the demon’s mouth were nonchalant, casual in nature. It was like he knew nothing of the bombshell he had dropped.
“Y-you know my daughter!?”Everything began to click. The demon appeared to be casually wandering around the Wicked Forest in spite of it being the Supreme Dragon’s nest. He was completely unarmed, which meant he was likely extremely powerful. And he even knew the name of Vergillus’ daughter.It could have only meant one thing.“Then you must be the Wicked Forest’s Demon Lord!”
“Yup, that’s m—”He was the prime evil that had kidnapped Lyuuin. And ravaged her.“Curse you, Demon Lord! Consider your life forfeit!”A violent rage overcame Vergillus’ mind as soon as he reached the conclusion. His thoughts were far too clouded for him to realize that the tone the man referred to his daughter in was amicable at worst.<– Prev — Next –>

Fatherhood — Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Well, I guess this means we’ve reached an agreement. Lyuu’s mine now.”Vergillus turned his gaze on the other man and examined him. He looked at his expression, observed the extent of his perspiration, and stared into his eyes. Each of the aspects he scrutinized only served to solidify his understanding of the demon lord’s sincerity.Assuming his nature had been a great folly.Equally of note was his daughter’s attraction to the man. The way she continued to steal glances at him with her cheeks dyed in red only served to further evidence that she would find herself happy with him by her side.He had always assumed that his daughter would have suffered nothing but abuse whilst kept within the demon lord’s domain. But reality was often stranger than fiction. The twist was one that the warwolf had trouble understanding, one that almost filled him with the urge to sigh and lament over the futility of his own actions. Never once had he imagined that the sole reason his daughter had never returned was simply because she hadn’t wanted to. Not even in his wildest dreams.He had always known that Lyuu wished to see the outside world, that she hated the small, isolated community that was the warwolf village. But the world was not so kind as to allow a young woman to wander about by herself, let alone one who had yet to be wed. He had always thought that keeping her caged was for none other than her own sake. But seeing the dungeon and the demon lord that governed it led him to reconsider.Defying Vergillus’ expectations came so naturally to the demon lord that he almost couldn’t believe it. Every single one of his calculations had been thrown to the winds and cast away. He didn’t know that it was possible for a demon lord to know the meaning of virtue. Of course, Yuki was not entirely virtuous. His desire to be waited upon by an entire unit of women was quite demon-lord like in nature. But that was the only aspect of his kind that he appeared to demonstrate. Unlike the others, he had even failed to become corrupted by his own might despite bearing more than enough to crush an entire army of warwolves. Yuki understood morality and abided by logic. And most importantly, the women who attended to him weren’t captives. They clearly trusted him and only remained by his side of their own free will.He was more akin to any other man than he was any other dark overlord. And he was sure to treat Lyuu well, to appreciate her for who she was.The choice to be made was obvious. No good would come of refusing it.“I understand. I will speak to Lynaut, and all the others, and ensure that they accept this decision. Our decision. I’ve already said this to that husband of yours, but I will come again to check on you in a year. Do your best to make sure you grow into your new role by the time that comes to pass.”Hearing Vergillus’ consent caused Lyuu’s face to come into bloom. A beautiful smile came to adorn it as would a flower underneath the morning sun. Mixed feelings assailed the father. It was the first time he had ever seen his daughter beam so brilliantly. He was proud of his decision and happy for her. And yet, his heart ached with loneliness.But such was what it meant for a father to see off a bride.＊ ＊ ＊While Vergillus had never before seen an inn constructed in the style of the one he and his men currently occupied, he felt it was still constructed in good taste. The soft, straw-like floor-coverings paired well with its simplistic and yet luxurious wood and paper-based design. His men were happily washing their weariness away with his son in law’s liquor stores while he and the man in question sat outside on the veranda.His gaze naturally fell on the demon lord’s home, his daughter’s home. The looming castle before him was as ominous as it was magnificent. Its dark material blended into the night sky and almost appeared act as a curtain that obscured the stars themselves. It was a wondrous scene, one that paired especially well with the rice-based wine he had spent most of the night drinking.“I have a question, demon lord.” he spoke as he kept his eyes on the castle and his hands on his cup.
“What’s up?”
“What is it that you like about my daughter?”
“Wow, going for that right off the bat, are we?” He smiled in an awkward, boyish manner. “Lots of things, honestly. But if I had to pick out the most important one, I’d probably say that it’s her easygoing attitude.”
“Oh?”
“Being around Lyuu makes it easy for me to relax,” he elaborated. “We always end up messing around and getting ourselves into all sorts of silly situations. It’s so much fun being around her that it almost makes me feel like a kid again. And if you ask me, I’d say that’s probably one of the most important parts of a long-term relationship. It means you can be yourself instead of having to worry about stepping on the other person’s toes.”The warwolf craned his neck and looked over at his daughter as the demon lord described her. She was happily serving all the other warwolves their food and drink while casually conversing with them and catching up on everything she had missed over the course of the last year. It was clear that she had grown, and the somewhat boastful smile that remained on her face throughout the process indicated she was well aware of it—and trying to show it off.Lyuuin had always been a tomboy. Her nature contrasted the taste of the average warwolf; most warwolf men preferred women of a much more effeminate disposition. However, there were still individuals who felt otherwise, as tastes and preferences were bound to vary. The demon lord’s statement had only served to further this point. His sensibilities were not what warwolves considered the norm.It appears that my daughter has found herself quite the partner. Vergillus entertained a thought that caused him to smile before posing a question. “What is Lyuu’s life like here?”
“Hmmm… Where do I start? Oh, I know. You see that maid over there? The one that looks perfectly at ease? That’s Leila. She and Lyuu started as maids at about the same time. Well, kinda,” he said. “They’re honestly only maids in name. They help out with some of the housework, but that’s pretty much it. Though, in Lyuu’s case, I’m not really sure help is always the right word. She’s gotten better about it now, but honestly, she’s a bit of a klutz.”
“I’m sorry. That would be my fault,” Vergillus chuckled. “I didn’t intend to spoil her, but as the chief’s daughter, she never did end up having too many household responsibilities.”
“I don’t mind.” The demon lord replied with a laugh of his own. “Everyone’s got strengths and weaknesses. Lyuu might not be all that useful when it comes to doing housework, but she’s pretty good at spreading all that excess energy of hers. Having her around keeps everyone else happy and invigorated.”
“…I’m glad to hear it.”
“You should be. It means you’ve raised her well, and that’s something worth being proud of.” The demon lord spoke as he refilled the warwolf’s cup. “Oh, right. You mind telling me what Lyuu was like before she left the village?”
“Thank you.” Vergillus drained its contents in one gulp. “She’s never told you?”
“I mean, she’s tried, but she’s not all that great at telling old tales, so I honestly haven’t learned all that much at all. And I’ve always wondered about the kind of life she used to live, you know?”
“Lyuu was always a bit of a peculiar girl.” The chief started to speak in a slow, nostalgic tone. “She was much more interested in a life outside of our village than one within its borders.”Vergillus began recounting story after story. He told the demon lord of her many mishaps and exploits, as well as various moments he considered her most important. He likely would have continued, had a certain embarrassed maid not run over to stop him.<– Prev — Next –>

A Fluffy Farewell
Editor(s): Speedphoenix“I-Is that wolf really what I think he is!? Is he truly a Fenrir!?”
“Yeah. He’s both another one of my family members and one of the biggest reasons Lyuu decided to stick around.” I gently pat the silver wolf beside me as I spoke to Lyuu’s petrified father.The sight of the legendary beast had him frozen in shock with his eyes bulging out of his sockets. The only part of him that seemed remain functional was his mouth, which twitched occasionally to serve to demonstrate that he was, in fact, still alive. His eyes remained glued to the wolf even after he finally recovered, as he kept his gaze on him as he nervously shot me a question.“Y-you were living with a Fenrir!?”
“Yeah. I was keeping it from you guys because I wasn’t really sure how you were going to react,” I said. “I ended up deciding that I might as well go for it because I thought you guys might appreciate it.”Rir had spent the past day standing by near, but not in the dungeon in order to mitigate the risk of his discovery. In the end, all that staking out of his had gone to waste because I had decided that I would’ve felt awkward about keeping him from my newly legalized relatives, so I called him over and had him show himself to the crowd. Speaking of my pets, everyone not named Rir or Shii was out hunting. They had been instructed with the task of pruning nearby monsters in order to make it easier for me to escort the warwolves back outside the forest.Worship was apparently the word of the day, as all the warwolves had gotten down on their knees and bowed their heads deeply in prayer. The religious activity honestly appeared more chaotic than solemn. Every beastkin present had chosen to use the space they currently occupied as opposed to organising themselves into a neater formation.Lyuu’s initial reaction to meeting Rir had been much less dramatic, so I had always assumed that the warwolves weren’t an overly zealous tribe. Today’s observations, however, proved that assumption wrong. Fenrirs were as divine to them as Odin was to the Nords.Speaking of dramatic reactions. There was also that one incident with Lynaut. Upon regaining consciousness, Lyuu’s ex-fiance had ended up screaming at me almost incoherently before running off and crying his heart out in a disgusting way that only a jock could manage. He then proceeded to spend the rest of the night drinking with his buddies, who did their best to cheer him up. I got the message, of course. Like the chief, he had wanted to warn me about breaking the warwolf princess’ heart. Wow. I guess he really did love her in his own way. Knowing that almost makes me feel a bit bad for cucking him. Almost. Oh well, his fault, not mine. Should’ve just beat me up if he didn’t want it to happen. Sorry man, but that’s how it is. You’re going to have to give up. But don’t worry, there are plenty of fish out there. I’m sure you’ll find another one eventually.“W-would you mind if I asked his name?”
“It’s Fluffrir, though we normally call him Rir, for short,” I said. “Rir, this is Lyuu’s dad.”The wolf greeted the chief with both a bark and a nod of the head.“I-it’s very nice to meet you. T-thank you for everything you’ve done for my daughter.”
“I think that’s somethin’ you’re supposed to say to Master, dad, not Rir.” Lyuu giggled
“B-be quiet, Lyuu. How else did you expect me to react to meeting a Fenrir? No true warwolf could possibly remain calm in a situation like this!”
“Well, I can kinda see where you’re comin’ from. Rir’s real dignified, but the least you can do is stay calm,” said Lyuu with a smug grin.
“Say all you want, but you were no better than they were when you first met him,” I said.
“You weren’t supposed to tell them that, Master!” she complained indignantly.Uh huh. Whatever you say, Lyuu. Whatever you say.“You’ve got a busy life ahead of you, Lyuu. You have to be both a good wife and take good care of a Fenrir. Do not make any careless mistakes. Do you understand me?” said my father in law, sternly.
“I-I won’t!” squeaked the dog girl. “But it’s okay! ‘Cause me ‘n Rir are real good buds. We’re basically family already, right Rir?”Lyuu smiled in my beloved pet’s direction and prompted him to bark in acknowledgement. But he didn’t. Rather than acknowledging her, he stubbornly turned his head in the opposite direction in a manner reminiscent of an angry teenage girl.“W-what the heck, Rir? W-why are you turning away from me?”She tried questioning him, but was once again faced with silence.“R-rir? Rir!? Aren’t you going to say anything?” She moved to the other side of his body in order to speak to his face, but he once again craned his neck as to not to have to look at her. “W-why do you gotta keep turning away from me!?”Only when she started panicking did he finally choose to face her. Playfully, he smiled.“W-were you just teasin’ me?”This time, the wolf both nodded and barked in affirmation.“Why’s this gotta be the only time you agree with me!?” shouted Lyuu, indignantly.It was such an entertaining interaction that I broke into a cackle.“They really do get along…” said Lyuu’s father, mystified. “I can’t believe it. My daughter’s befriended a Fenrir…”
“Well, that is kinda what happens when you live with someone for a whole year,” I said.Although they weren’t exactly on bad terms, it was unusual for Rir to be this relaxed in Lyuu’s vicinity; her… habits had made him rather wary of her. He was only playing along this time in order to help her show off to her father. What a gentleman. Er, gentlewolf? Is that even a thing?“Rir really is just like his owner,” sighed Lyuu.
“And what, exactly, is that supposed to mean?” I asked.
“Nothin’, nothin’ at all, Master,” she said. “Just that you two are both real nice.”
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s exactly what you meant.” I laughed a bit before hopping on the Fenrir’s back. “Come on, Lyuu, you too.”
“T-Thanks, Master.”She blushed a bit as she took the hand I had extended to her, only to squeal in panic as I pulled her all the way up without any prior warning and placed her in front of me. Her thick, bushy tail brushed up against my stomach, tickling it, as her ears twitched in surprise.“Oh, right. If you’re mine now, I guess that means that these ears of yours are mine too, right?”“That ain’t how that works, Master! They’re still my e—eeek! That tickles!”I ignored her attempt at reasoning and reached for the soft appendages that protruded from her curly locks and began to rub them.“Hmmm, not bad. Not bad at all. They’re nice, soft, and silky,” I said. “But they’re not as nice as Rir’s. I’d say these are a seven and a half out of ten.”
“W-w-w-what the heck!? You can’t just go around touchin’ people’s ears like that!” complained Lyuu as she nearly jumped out of her seat.Like the dog girl herself, Rir wasn’t all that content with me getting all touchy feely with Lyuu on his back. He whined a few times as if to complain, but I pretended not to notice as I engrossed myself in fiddling with the ears that had been placed right in front of my eyes. So firm. So crisp. Hnnng.“This is sexual harassment, master! I’m gunna tell Lefi!”
“It would be, if sexual harassment actually applied to couples,” I said with a smirk. “I would know. I’m not looking to get in trouble. Why else do you think I didn’t do this earlier?”
“Darn it, Master, why do you have to be right!?” complained Lyuu as she contemplated the differences between welcome and unwelcome sexual advances.Heh. You hear that, gentlemen? This is what it means to be a real man of honour. You keep your hands to yourself. Until you don’t have to anymore. My desire not to be seen as a sexual predator was behind most of my self-restraint. It was why I had never fiddled with any of Lyuu’s fluff or touched Leila’s horns in spite of the fact that my curiosity was driving me insane. Alright, fine. There were a feeeeeew incidents with Lefi, but that was totally not my fault. She was the one who came onto me, which made everything completely different and totally okay.“Ahem.” Lyuu’s father loudly cleared his throat before shooting me a glare. The man was so mad I could see his veins bulging out of his head. Yeah, that does kinda seem like the kind of look you’d have on your face if you were forced to watch someone flirt with your daughter.After a moment of contemplation, I took my hands off the man’s daughter and watched as she hung her head in embarrassment and shame.“I don’t mind you being intimate, but please, keep it behind closed doors,” he said in a low growl.
“R-right!” said Lyuu., “W-we should really get to seeing everyone off, Master.”
“Riiight, yeah. We were doing that. Sorry for the wait guys. I’ll show you guys out of the forest. Let’s go.”
“Thank you,” said my father in law.
“Oh, right. That reminds me. Making your way through the forest every single time you want to come here is probably more danger than it’s worth. You can stop just outside of it next time you feel like visiting, and I’ll head over and pick you guys up.”The warwolves had made their way into my territory through the forest’s southern area, the part where its weakest monsters dwelled. I didn’t have control over it just yet, but I was planning to have it integrated as another one of the dungeon’s parts by this time next year.“Thank you. That certainly does sound like a much better alternative,” said the chief. “Alright men, we’re leaving! We may have Yuki and the Fenrir with us, this time, but that doesn’t mean you can let your guard down! Not even for an instant!”
“Yes sir!”The warriors raised their weapons and roared to show that they were ready for battle. Yeah uh, I’m pretty sure that’s entirely unnecessary. Everything’s already either gone or dead. And I’m pretty sure I already told him not to worry about it.***Though I had told him it was safe ahead of time, Lyuu’s father hadn’t truly accepted my claim as truth until partway through the journey.“I know that you told us not to worry, but I almost cannot believe that we have yet to be attacked,” he said. “The monsters were so persistent on our way in. They came at us endlessly, one wave after another.”
“Yeah, that’s just how they are. Half of it just because we have Rir here. He’s much stronger than anything that lives in the area so he scares most things off,” I said with a shrug. “My other subordinates are getting rid of everything else, so we’re pretty much in the clear.”
“I suppose demon lords really are different from the rest of us after all…” said Lyuu’s father. “Ah, right. The nearest human country appears to be going through some sort of turmoil.”
“Is it?”Referencing my mental map, I arrived at the conclusion that he was speaking about the kingdom I had visited in order to deal with a certain prince. It was the country whose king I was personally acquainted with, and the country Nell owed her services to. What was it called again? Allysia? Yeah, something like that.“I’ve heard that it’s in the midst of some sort of political strife, one rocking the country’s very core. I know that they probably don’t pose much of a threat, as far as you, or this forest, is concerned, but I thought that it would be better to warn you, just in case.”Again? Seriously? Wow. Not that I really give a shit, but still. Wow. Their problems didn’t particularly interest me, and I wasn’t planning on getting involved unless I was forcibly dragged into the equation. …Though I might want to double check all my traps and make sure they’re all still working. And placed right. I’ve already signed that one deal with the king, so I doubt they’ll be coming here ever again, but I’d rather be ready for nothing than find myself caught with my pants down. Yeah. Note to self: do dungeon stuff after seeing off the warwolves.Only later would I realize that I would have likely taken a very different set of actions had I asked my father in law for the reason Alllysia had once again found itself in the midst of a political struggle.<– Prev — Next –>

I Need More DP
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“…Shit.” I found myself moaning and groaning as I looked over the dungeon’s balance sheet just a few days after seeing off Lyuu’s people. The transaction history showed that we were in the red despite the all-time high my balance had been sitting at just a few weeks prior. In fact, we had been in the red for quite some time. My net balance, which was trending its way towards zero, sat at only a twentieth of its peak. Of course, that meant my wallet wasn’t completely empty just yet, but my funds were likely to run dry within the month.I hadn’t been all that active in shifting the dungeon’s boundaries as of late, and I have made sure to go hunting every once in a while, so I had assumed that all would be fine. I hadn’t any real memory of doing anything that would lead to an increase in expenses. The only possible cause I could think of was the recent change in the dungeon’s resident count. There was, of course, also the fact that I had lost my biggest source of income in Lefi. Welp. This is basically all a result of poor planning on my part. Managing my resource pool was something that I hadn’t exactly been doing. I didn’t bother keeping track of the numbers because it had seemed like more of a pain in the ass than it was worth. Evidently, I was wrong and my stupidity had once again reared its ugly head.Upon re-evaluating my spendings, I realized that I had accidentally thrown the concept of frugality out the window. I had been far too caught up in setting up new gimmicks and contraptions to even look at the cost of each. Until now, of course. Shiiiiiiiiit. This must be what it’s like to win the lottery, live the high life, and then forget what it’s like to be poor, not curb your spending, and go broke.Whatever the cause, I was going to have to do something about the state of our finances. Man, I swear I haven’t had to worry about DP in forever. Oh well, whatever. Time to get to fundraising, I guess.***After a good bit of consideration, I ultimately ended up choosing to resolve the situation at hand by playing the phone-a-friend card. The friend I happened to have in mind was situated within the true throne room.“Lefi, the situation has turned sour, and it has unfortunately come to my understanding that I desperately require your assistance.” I summarized the situation as I prostrated myself before her and the cushion she was seated atop of. My tone was abnormal, I had intentionally gone out of my way to speak as formally as one requesting a loan from a bank.“I know not what you are talking about. You will need to explain yourself,” she said.
“I’m terribly sorry, ma’am. I’ll have the details explained to you immediately. The long and short of it is that I happened to encounter a bit of an issue, and I was hoping the legendary Supreme Dragon would consider aiding me in its resolution.”
“I know that you choose only to speak in such a disgustingly polite manner when your goal is deception. What is it that you really want?”Oh shit, she knows!“Why, I would never,” I said. Though Lefi had already seen through me, I knew exactly which buttons to press to make her forget her suspicions. “You see, ma’am, I simply wanted you to hear out my woes and resolve them before I have no choice but to stop serving dessert.”
“What!?” The dragon pushed herself up from her seated position and shoved her face right in mine.
“H-hold on,” I said, reverting to my usual tone. “Stop shouting and chill out.”Though a series of frustrated dragon noises followed, Lefi eventually managed to regain her calm and sit back down with her legs crossed. Unlike before, she was now giving me her undivided attention in order to ensure that she could best combat every threat to her daily intake of sugar. Just saying, sitting cross-legged with a one-piece on is a terrible idea. I can totally see your panties.“What exactly is the matter?” she asked.
“Our finances,” I said. “My wallet is looking pretty empty right about now. I’m probably going to run out of DP within the month.”
“And I believe that you mentioned that this ‘Deepee’ happens to be the substance you employ in the fabrication of goods?”
“Yup, you got it. We were in the green for a good while, so I wasn’t really paying much attention to it. Turns out, that was a mistake,” I said. “I’ve been using it the same way I always have, but apparently we’ve got too many people for that to be sustainable now.”
“…And I take it that I no longer generate any of this substance for you now that we have become mates?”
“Well… yeah, that certainly is a part of it, but it’s not your fault. It’s mine. I should’ve planned ahead instead of forgetting about it.”While marrying Lefi certainly had changed our financial situation, I found it to be a trade well worth engaging in. I wouldn’t have changed my mind even if I had known that we would ultimately end up in financial distress as a result. She was worth more to me than any amount of cash could ever be. And although losing the Lefi bonus certainly did make a difference, it wasn’t the straw that broke the camel’s back in the first place. I was still in the green in the days following our marriage. The issues only started to appear after I bolstered the dungeon’s size, got us some new pets, and worked a bit on security, which meant it really was all my fault and none of hers.“So, yeah, I figured I should probably do something before shit hits the fan. I came to you because I didn’t want to worry any of the others. Ideally, I’d like for them to never know that anything was ever wrong to begin with.”There were, of course, many sustainable options. I could always go hunting more often for active income or expand the dungeon’s boundaries for more passive income. But I needed a stop-gap for the time being in order to ease my concerns. That was why I wanted to borrow Lefi’s might.“And that is why you have come to me, and me alone?”
“Yeah. You’re the only person I can trust when it comes to stuff like this.”
“Y-Yes, I can see that.” Her cheeks reddened as she muttered her words with joy and pride.Wew. She’s so simple-minded that it’s adorable and I love her for it.“…I understand the issue at hand,” she said after clearing her throat. “As your ever-reliable mate, I shall lend you my assistance.”Thanks Wifey, you’re the best. I knew I could count on you.“So? What exactly is it that you wish for me to do?”<– Prev — Next –>

A Discussion En Route
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“…It is far too bright out here.” Lefi groaned as she waltzed out of the cave the dungeon was located within and found herself exposed to the sun’s light. She glared at it from between the fingers she was using to filter out its rays, her face twisted into an annoyed scowl.
“When was the last time you went outside anyway?”
“I don’t quite recall,” she said. “Very few of my recent memories entail exiting the living room, and those that do involve only remaining within the grasslands that lay outside the castle.”
“I’m guessing that’s only ‘cause the girls keep asking you to play with them, right?”
“Indeed.”
“Thought so. You’ve been getting pretty damn good at looking after them recently.”
“I concur.” She giggled before breaking into a boastful, toothy grin. “But I suppose it is to be expected. Entertaining a mere child or two is a simple task for one as great as I.”
“Well, that is why they call you the Supreme Dragon, isn’t it?” I chuckled. “Thanks for always looking after everyone when I’m out. Really appreciate it.”
“If you have truly come to understand my value, then it would do you well to pay me more respect,” she says. “To begin, you must offer me a seat upon your shoulders.”
“Whatever you say, your majesty, whatever you say.”I ducked down, stuck my head between her beautiful, dainty legs and hoisted her up onto my shoulders as I stood back up.“Riding upon your shoulders never fails to disappoint,” she said. “It provides a wonderful perspective, one that allows me to gaze upon the earth from above.”
“I mean, yeah, sure, but you can fly. Isn’t that literally the same thing but better?”
“Flight certainly does bear many a merit,” she said. “But seating myself atop your shoulders allows me to feel as if I am still connected. Both to the world beneath me, and to you.”
“Connected, huh…?” I smiled.
“It allows me to bask in both the sensation of your touch and feel every step you take. It is pleasant, calming even, and bears a stark distinction from the almost lonely sensation that accompanies the act of treading the earth myself.”For a moment, I was shocked into silence. I didn’t know what I was supposed to say to the profession of her loneliness, nor how I was supposed to cure it. The right words didn’t seem to pop into my mind no matter how hard I thought. That was why I decided to stop trying and just be myself.“Well, feel free to come crying to me if you ever feel lonely then. I’ll do this for you anytime,” I smirked as I spoke in a mischievous tone. “You are my precious little wifey after all. I don’t mind sweeping you up in my arms if it means making you happy.”
“Hmph,” she snorted in an attempt to shake off her embarrassment. Though I couldn’t see her face, I was sure it had been dyed a shade of scarlet. “You never do seem to get sick of teasing me, do you?”What followed her retort was a whine. Not from her, but rather from the wolf two steps behind me. I sensed exasperation in his voice; it was almost like he was begging us to get a room, but as usual, I chose to ignore his complaints.“Why did you choose not to have Lyuu’s people remain within the dungeon if your finances were in such a dire state?” asked Lefi.
“I thought about it, and it just doesn’t seem like something that would work. Lyuu’s old man only brought the tribe’s warriors with him, so about two thirds of their men. They’ve still got lots of family back home, and having an entire village suddenly move in sounds like a trainwreck waiting to happen.”There was also the fact that I wasn’t all that fond of living with a bunch of random people. I was more than willing to call Lyuu’s father an in-law given that I had ended up turning his daughter into one of my wives. But that was more of a formality than it was anything else. He was family, in name but I didn’t truly think of him that way. I had only known him for a grand total of three days, after all.Physical proximity wasn’t even the issue. We had plenty of space. I just didn’t want to deal with them. Naturally, I was planning on lending a hand if anything ever happened to them, but that was it. Living with them was something I wanted to avoid. I just knew that it was going to be much more trouble than it was worth. Because moving them in would change how I lived my life. And that was something I had absolutely no intention of doing.“I certainly see your point,” said Lefi. “And that is not even to mention their lack of strength. They were so frail that they would have perished before reaching the dungeon if you had not chosen to lend them your aid.”
“Oh yeah, that reminds me. Why are the monsters around here so strong anyway? I never actually realized it until I saw a bit more of the world, but everything that lives in this forest is straight up overpowered, at least compared to what you see everywhere else.”
“I believe the answer to that question can be found through an inspection of the differences between this land and any other. This forest houses a concentration of magical particles far greater than the norm. As the creatures that reside within go about their lives, they consume the forest’s bounty and breathe in its air. In doing so, they concentrate within themselves vast quantities of magical particles. As their bodies acclimate to the surplus of magic, they become more adaptable and less resistant to drastic changes in their physical forms. The cycle only continues as the strong consume the weak and take their magical energies for themselves.”Ohhh… So basically more magic = more OP. That actually makes a lot of sense.“Alright, I get that, but that then begs another question. Why does this place have so many magical particles to begin with?”
“A good question. That is not something I have ever thought about myself.” Lefi paused for a moment to think. “But I do recall a tale told to me long ago by one of the older ancient dragons.”
“Hmm… Sounds interesting. Do tell.”Wait, Lefi’s been alive for a helluva long time, right? So exactly how long ago is long ago? Like, are we talking a few hundred years? Maybe a thousand?“He predicated it by stating that it was a tale that he had heard from his parents before they passed,” she said. “He told me that a god had once walked this land. And that this is where he perished. The magical energy within this so-called god dispersed throughout the land upon his death and came to form the forest we see around us.”Wait. So this is where GOD died? Holy shit. That’s an important plot point if I’ve ever heard one. Seriously, talk about hitting all the fantasy buttons.“Wait, didn’t you say you’ve never seen any gods before? And that they probably didn’t actually exist?
“Yes, Yuki, but the world is vast. While I do consider myself rather knowledgeable, there is still much that I have not yet heard of, let alone seen for myself,” she said. “Still, I doubt that the creature that perished here was a true god, but rather, a monster so long-lived that it was revered as one.”
“A monster revered as a god, huh? That’s an interesting thought.”Everyone pretty much thinks of monsters as harmful creatures that need to be removed. Going from that to something everyone worships is one helluva promotion if I’ve ever heard of one.“Names and titles are often subject to change. I, for example, was born as Leficios and feared as the Supreme Dragon for generations. But now, I simply go by Lefi, the name you gave me. Given my own experiences, I certainly do think it possible for a monster to be considered a god.” She leaned over to look me in the face as she smiled. “Those with shorter lives, creatures who take on forms like yours, remember creatures like us as legends. The simple act of living out our lives causes our names to be etched into history’s annals. And our deaths are no different. For they too bear great meaning to those who come after us. It certainly is a bizarre phenomenon. Life is quite a wonder, isn’t it?”Carving your name into history by becoming a legend, huh? That’s a grandiose thought if I’ve ever heard one. But I mean, she is right. Life really does seem both weird and incredible if you think about it like that. Yeah. A wonderful life indeed.“Well, if a long life and a lot of magic is all it takes to become a god, I’d say you’re well on your way.” I grinned at her. “Give it another couple thousand years, and everyone will probably start worshipping you too.”
“I suppose that would make you the man that stole God’s heart. That certainly does sound like a much more impressive title than ‘Demon Lord,’ doesn’t it?”
“Yeah, sounds like one I wouldn’t mind growing into. Carving out this world’s mythos by your side and leaving proof that we were here, living our lives, sounds like something I’d enjoy,” I laughed. “But if I want to be worth my salt, I’d better start working my way up the ladder, huh? Right now, I haven’t got much of a name to me. I’m just like any other insignificant demon lord in the middle of nowhere. But just you watch. Soon I’ll be the biggest baddie around.”
“Good. Then I shall ascend to godhood as I wait for you to accomplish that exact feat.”After exchanging another pair of laughs, the two of us smiled at each other and continued on our journey.<– Prev — Next –>

Solving the DP Problem
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerOnly the slightest bit of sunlight filtered through the overgrown canopy; the treetops had formed a near impregnable layer of greenery, one able to prevent even the sun’s rays from piercing through to the forest floor. In most environments, the relative lack of light would have served as an indication that the trees had grown too densely. But the Wicked Forest was no average biome.While they certainly couldn’t be called sparse, the trees had more than enough room to themselves. There were sometimes even tens of meters between each individual. The problem lay not in their number, but rather their size. Rir and I were hidden behind a root belonging to one such monstrosity. Its trunk was so thick that a group of five fully grown adults would likely have struggled to wrap their arms around it even if they stretched their arms out as far as they would go.I had kept Stealth active just to make sure I stayed out of sight, but the precaution was entirely unnecessary. The behemoth’s roots were so tall that all I needed to do to stay hidden was take a knee. My companion was equally impossible to spot, as he had shrunk himself down to the size of a regular wolf.“Alright, just making sure, you still remember Lefi’s exact location, right?” I stuck my head out from behind the root and gazed at the bizarre monster that my pet and I were getting ready to tackle.Naturally, my question was met with agreement; Rir was never one to disappoint.“Alright, sounds good. I’m going to run through the plan one more time. Should be pretty simple. We grab that thing’s attention, then get the fuck out as quick as we can. Alright?”Again, an affirmative wolf noise answered my query.“Then let’s do this!”There was no longer any need for me to stay hidden, so I stood up and aimed a spell at our target. It was a strange creature, one that looked to be part mammal, part arachnid. The top half of its body resembled that of a bear. It had beady eyes, and a muscular frame covered in fur. Crunching noises echoed throughout our surroundings as it chewed through the bloody corpse that lay underneath its scorpion-like lower body.Its large frame made it an easy target. My water dragons flew true.As a rather powerful monster, it noticed the attack and raised its head from its meal to look in my direction—an action that only caused it to take the draconic projectiles face first.In the long run, my accuracy meant nothing. Scorpiobear’s stats were so much higher than mine that it didn’t mind being hit in the face. The fact that it had swung one of its legs at the dragons and destroyed their lower halves before they could land didn’t help much either. Still, I had fulfilled my goal.An electrical explosion, one generated by none other than the proud Fenrir himself, blinded both the bear and I as it landed right on the half-arachnid’s freshly soaked frame. Unlike my spell, whose purpose was only to serve as the set up, Rir’s did damage. Real damage.The agitated bear roared, turned towards us, and broke into a charge.“Alright, it took the bait! Let’s get the fuck outta here!”I leapt onto Rir’s back as he grew back to his full size and took off like a racecar. Unlike the enraged arachnomammal, which plowed through every bit of greenery in its way with pure destructive force, Rir weaved between the trees and avoided everything in his path. Wow, seeing a bear scuttle like that is actually kinda gross. Yeaaaah, definitely not something I’d like for dinner.“Wow, Rir, you better watch out. He’s right on our tail,” I said, jokingly, as the wolf continued to maintain a safe distance with ease. “You know, this kinda reminds me of the time we fought that dumb ass manticore. Man, fuck that thing.”Though the only response I got was the usual short bark, I could tell that the wolf was exasperated, and extremely so. He clearly wanted me to stop losing myself in my thoughts and focus on the task at hand.We wouldn’t have normally bothered challenging a beast this powerful. Its defences were so difficult to break that we normally would have found it near impossible to take down. But this time, I wasn’t nearly as concerned. Because we were just the bait. It was too slow to catch up to us and too dumb to cast any spells. It posed zero threat so long as we didn’t try to engage it in any sort of risky CQC. And that was precisely why we had chosen it. We were sure to succeed in luring it to our destination so long as we didn’t let our guard down. Riiiight. That’s probably why he was telling me to stay on my toes. Derp.The lure process was simple. All we did was fire a spell or two at it every once in a while to make sure it stayed mad enough to keep chasing us. Rinsing and repeating for a few minutes led us to a clearing, one that housed a beautiful, horned maiden whose sleek silver hair fluttered in the wind.“Lefi!” I shouted her name, the signal, as we passed right by her.
“I will see it done.”She spread her arms wide as she awaited Scorpiobear, as if to embrace it. But she brought them back together right before it reached her. It was almost like she was clapping, almost. If I had to name one key difference, it would be that the action she had conducted was far more deadly than a mere clap or two could ever be.Scorpiobear’s head popped.It exploded not into gore or viscera, but a bloody mist. A blood mist that soon faded without a trace.The rest of the creature’s body, everything from the neck down, collapsed onto the ground and simply stopped.“…Wow. I almost can’t believe you took that thing down in one hit. But I guess that is what it means to be the Supreme Dragon.” I jumped off Rir’s back and walked up to her as I spoke. Fortunately, I didn’t have to go very far because the wolf had started hitting the breaks the moment he passed her.
“It is only to be expected. A monster this weak does not amount to much of a foe.”Though Lefi had shrugged off the feat as no big deal, it was one that I couldn’t possibly have pulled off. The strange scorpion-like bears were creatures that Rir and I would never fail to run from. Neither my might nor my magic could pierce their tough hides. But to her, they were just insignificant whelps, lambs to the slaughter.Observing her with magic eye had demonstrated that the technique she employed was much more precise and involved than it otherwise would have appeared at first glance. Because while she certainly had clapped the bear to death, she hadn’t done it with her hands. It was a spell, a spell that took command of an incredibly dense ball of mana and shaped it into a pair of hands before smashing the creature’s skull to bits.She was strong, so incredibly strong that I found it impossible to gauge just how much she was capable of outputting. Creating something as dense as her hands would cost me a fifth of my mana pool. Sustaining it was already beyond me. Using it as a weapon, as she had, was simply out of the question. And she’s been doing that non-stop since we started. Holy shit.“I have no doubt that you will grow powerful enough to do this with ease within the next hundred years.”
“Yeah, sounds about right.”Man, I almost can’t believe I’m agreeing with her. Is my sense of time really that messed up already? I mean, I did basically completely fail to notice that a year had passed, so… Man, that’s kinda fucked.The Lefi-based scheme I’d come up with to farm DP was fairly simple. The technique was no different from the usual; we had gone out in order to hunt. Our targets, however, were. We had ventured into the Wicked Forest’s western hemisphere in order to hunt its most powerful creatures. Normally, they were foes I would never have tangled with. Every fight was equivalent to a dance with death, one in which I’d struggle to come out on top. That was why I had explicitly ordered all my pets to stay away from the western area.Today, however, was an exception. My beautiful wife, who just happened to be the strongest thing in the Wicked Forest, was lending us a hand. She was assisting us in murdering everything that we tricked into stepping into the dungeon’s bounds. We could have simply went around butchering things, but dragging them into my territory before killing them was more efficient because it allowed us to double up on our gains. As the monsters were much more powerful than usual, our income ended up being a whole order of magnitude higher. As far as stop-gaps went, this one was perfect.In dragon form, the aura of power she radiated was so immense and overwhelming that it would have scared everything off before they even got close. That was why she hadn’t bothered reverting. Staying in her girl form had allowed her to butcher every single bit of prey we brought her without it realizing that it needed to turn tail and flee. Hook, line, and sinker. RIP monsters. On a more serious note, I really owe her for this. We totally would’ve been boned without her. Like, checkmate tier boned.Wait, is it just me, or am I basically completely useless? Rir totally could’ve done all this without me. All I do is sit on his back.…Well, I mean, that’s just what mission control does, right? My job is to give orders, especially if shit goes down. Yeah, I’m not useless at all. Totally. Ahahaha…Our current excursion was comprised of three teams. Teams A and B were responsible for luring. A was comprised of Rir and I, whereas B contained the other four battle-ready pets I had at my disposal. C was just Lefi.In other words, I hadn’t brought Enne. I didn’t think that it was all that necessary or even efficient to have her accompany us as we weren’t actually picking any real fights. As a long-ass greatsword, she was heavy, and adding her weight to the equation didn’t really seem like the best of ideas given the fact that our strategy relied almost entirely on speed. That said, I hadn’t come empty-handed. I was far too cautious not to equip myself, so I’d swapped an iron rod into my greatsword slot, one that I’d made back when I first started crafting weapons. Man, blunt weapons are so easy to use. Why do swords need so much finesse and technique? Goddammit. 3hard5me.While I certainly had called the weapon an iron rod, it wasn’t actually any iron rod. It was made of adamantite, one of this world’s most precious metals, and had been engraved with three enchantments. The first, the one Leila had derived for me, was the most interesting. Inspecting Rir’s self-adjusting collar had allowed her to extract its magic circuit, one that granted objects the ability to grow and shrink on command. Changing the rod’s size as I swung it around made me feel like the Monkey King—as far as I was concerned, the rod’s ability to get as big or small as I wanted it to more or less equated it to the Ruyi Bang.The other two circuits, Magical Prowess of the Highest Order, and Greater Magical Conductivity Boost, made it much easier for me to cast spells. Long story short, it’s a fucking super stick.It only did a tiny fraction of Enne’s damage, but it was still certainly useful in its own right. Alright, I know what you’re thinking. “What the fuck, Yuki? You can’t just call it an iron rod if it’s made out of adamantite!” Yeah, I know. And I don’t care. Adamantite rod just doesn’t roll off the tongue the same way, so fuck it. I’m calling it an iron rod, logic be damned.“You just missed the other group,” said Lefi. “I would like to note that the four of them have grown dramatically since their advent. Their intellect has improved by leaps and bounds.”
“I know, right? Aren’t they the best pets ever?”
“Indeed they are. Like Rir, they are all outstanding individuals.”That they are, Wifey. That they are. As their owner, I felt as if it was my responsibility to aid in their growth. But I almost never did. In fact, I functioned as more of a distraction than anything else. I only ever interacted with them to play around. Oooooops. Lol.***“Oh man, what a day. Talk about making a good bit of cold, hard, cash.” I stretched my arms out as far as they would go before allowing myself to fall back into the soft pillow behind me. The warm and fluffy sensation of Rir’s thick, bushy fur was nothing short of wonderful.I slowly slid down the side of his body and collapsed a seated position. Lefi plopped herself down in my lap and leaned into my chest as soon as I settled into a comfortable position.“That was quite the effort,” she said. “The sheer amount of time we expended turned it into a rather exhausting task despite its simplicity. I take it you will be treating me to whatever I want upon our return?”
“Heh, ‘course I will, governatore. Make sure you keep it up, èh? We’ll be glad to have you along per all our schemes.” I said in a half-baked Italian accent.
“I don’t quite follow the reason for which you’ve adopted such a strange tone.” The dragon girl raised a brow.
“Don’t worry about it.” I laughed. “I can’t wait to get home. The first thing I’m going to do is jump into the bath and have myself a nice, long soak. Then, I’m going to grab some booze, wrap myself up in some nice, silky blankets, and drift off to dreamland.”
“That certainly does sound like a splendid way to spend the night,” she said. “I take it you chose to make me aware of your plans because you were planning to share?”
“Of course. I’m always down for drinking an evening away with you.”Lefi had made us way more than enough DP. Wasting a bit on booze was a non-concern. Not that we even need to. I’m pretty sure we’ve still got the five barrels the Demon King gave me. Those’ll probably last us another two-odd months. Oh, speaking of booze with people, we should do a drinking party sometime. Or maybe an evening banquet, something where all of us can get hammered together. Except the kids, of course. They’ll be stuck with juice until they get older.“If those are our evening plans, then I would like to head home immediately. I cannot wait any longer. Dinner, dessert, and liquor await us.” She got up off my lap and impatiently looked towards the dungeon.
“Sounds like a plan.” Likewise, I also got to my feet before turning around to face the five other members of my household that had aided in solving my financial crisis. “Alright everyone, it’s time for Lefi and I to head home. Thanks again for all your help. I’ll probably hit you guys up again within the next couple of days. Let’s all go on a nice leisurely walk or something soon.”After petting all five to show my gratitude, I turned heel and headed home with my favourite dragon girl in tow.<– Prev — Next –>

The Demon Lord’s Wives’ Offensive
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Aaaand we’re back.”
“That we are.”Lefi and I announced our presence as we stepped through the door inside the cave and entered the true throne room.“Welcome home, Darlin’!”
“Welcome home, Darling!”I was immediately greeted by both Lyuu and Nell. The pair had voiced their lines in the sweetest, sultriest tones they could manage and even blown a kiss for added effect. Both girls had taken up the exact same pose, one that they had obviously coordinated ahead of time. They had bent over whilst pulling their arms behind their backs in order to emphasize their cleavage.“…So I’m already starting to feel pretty hungry. What’s for dinner tonight, Leila?” I walked right past both girls and headed towards the kitchen in order to address the one individual I trusted to have remained sane.
“We’ll be having doria tonight, My Lord.”
“Doria? Nice. I love doria. Can’t wait.”
“W-what the heck, Master!? Don’t just ignore us!” Lyuu spun around and grabbed me by the shoulders in a desperate attempt to dissuade me from continuing towards the kitchen. “At least tell us how you felt! Come on! Anythin’ll do! Look how hard we, your adorable wives, are tryin’ to knock your socks off! Can’t you see how sexy these poses are!?”
“Sexy…? You mean embarrassing?” I asked. “I can’t even look at you two right now.”
“That’s gotta be ’cause they were totally workin’ way too well, right?”I don’t know about you, but all I’m getting out of this is a cringe. Evidently, I wasn’t the only one to have thought that the girls had embarrassed themselves. In fact, Nell was so ashamed that she had turned to face a corner, squatted down, and hid her face with her hands. She was, quite literally, red all the way up to her ears. Which means this is probably another one of Lyuu’s “bright” ideas.Unlike the warwolf, the hero had been showing signs of embarrassment from the get-go. In fact, it seemed that she had really pushed herself to go through with it, as she had started trembling by the time she blew a kiss.“…Where did you learn that dumb pose anyway?” I asked.
“I saw you show it to the kids when you were playin’ with them, Master. And I remember it made ya grin from ear to ear,” she said. “I know you’re more attracted to kids than adults, but I thought you might like to see us doin’ it too.”
“…So I’ve got plenty to comment about that. But first of all, could you not make it sound like I’m some sort of child molestor? Because I’m not.”
“You ain’t…? Really…?” asked Nell, wide-eyed.
“Why does that come as a surprise…?”I wasn’t very amused. I certainly had taught the girls a bunch of silly shit while we were playing house, but it wasn’t because I was some sort of sick pervert. While I certainly was grinning from ear to ear, it wasn’t because I was getting off. Rather, I just found the juxtaposition ironically entertaining. You hear that, FBI? It was just for shits and giggles. I’m innocent. And definitely not a sexual deviant. Definitely.The time I spent conversing with Lyuu allowed Nell to shake off a little bit of her initial embarrassment. She took her hands off her face and turned back towards us. “See, Lyuu? I told you this wouldn’t work,” she groaned, “Yuki only gets turned on by children! There’s no way we could’ve possibly knocked his socks off!”
“That ain’t true, Nell! I’m sure Master’s real happy. I bet he’s just tryin’ his best not to let it show ‘cause he’s embarrassed. He’s still grinnin’, just on the inside,” said Lyuu. “The difference between us and the littler girls is that he ain’t able to stop his smile from comin’ up to the surface when he sees them do it ‘cause it makes him too excited to hold it all in.”
“Girls, please. This whole conversation seems predicated on the assumption that I get turned on by children. Which I do not,” I said. “Knock it off already.”Much to my annoyance, neither of the two seemed to acknowledge the claim in any which way, but they at least stopped talking about it. Mostly because Lefi had happened to decide to join the conversation.“You are certainly putting your best efforts into impressing him, Lyuu.”
“O’course I am!” she declared, peppily. “I ain’t just any other maid anymore! I’ve gone and turned into one of Master’s wives too!” The maid’s face slowly reddened as she spoke. “And that means I gotta make him real happy!”It almost physically pains me to admit this, but that big embarrassed smile is pretty cute in its own right. Though Lyuu and I had, according to her father, been wed, not much had really changed. The warwolf was still a maid. She still wore maid clothes and did maid things. Likewise, the power dynamic between her and Leila had also remained completely unchanged.There was, however, one thing that had changed. Our relationship. We were no longer master and servant, but rather, husband and wife. At least in name, anyway. While I wasn’t really acting much different, Lyuu was doing what she believed all wives should: trying her goddamn best to keep me as happy as she could.Despite growing up as a tomboy, the wolf maid seemed to greatly admire the newlywed life. She had, apparently, always dreamed of one day being a bride and letting her girlier side loose. That, in and of itself, wasn’t the problem. If anything, I thought it was adorable. Or at least it would have been had her head not been full of delusions, delusions that she was trying to bring to the real world; her imagination had led her to create scenarios which were unbefitting of her nature, unrealistic, or skewed in some other manner. Every single one she tried to live out always had something or another wrong with it. Lyuu never has been the brightest of the bunch. So I guess this is kinda expected.Throwing the over-imagined scenarios she came up with into a blender with Nell’s inability to refuse just about anything created what I could only see as a stain on the poor hero’s record, a shameful memory that would span the ages. Artificially, that is. Note to self: remind Nell about her embarrassing antics as soon as she forgets.“Come on, Lefi! You gotta do it too and totally blow Master away!”
“I… will refrain.”
“What the heck!? Come on, Lefi! Just do it!”
“…You know. That doesn’t sound half bad. I’ve already got it pictured in my head, and I’m kinda wanting to see actually happen,” I said.
“Y-You do!?” squeaked the dragon.Heh. Hook, line, and sinker. I’m totally going to point fingers and laugh my ass off the moment she tries. I can already see exactly how ridiculous she’ll look.“Come on, Lefi! Now you really gotta do it!” said Lyuu. “Even Master’s sayin’ he wants you to! So be just like us and do yer best to make him smile!”
“I-I do not think it would be very enjoyable for either party.”The reluctant silver-haired maiden looked to the only friend that had yet to betray her for help. “W-what say you, Nell? As a victim of Lyuu’s scheme yourself, do you not agree that there is little reason for me to attempt something so ridiculous?”“…Just do it Lefi,” grumbled the hero. “If I had to, then you should too.”
“Curses,” grumbled the dragon. “I did not expect to be betrayed by your resentment and remorse.”
“You see, Lefi? There’s no fighting it.” I said. “Come on.”
“Yeah, come on, Lefi! Do it!” added Lyuu as she tugged at the hem of the other girl’s dress.Our thorough attempts at convincing her eventually seemed to get through. “Fine… I will do it, so stop pestering me.” Lefi sighed in annoyance, took a step forward, faced her back to us, cleared her throat, and took a deep breath. “W-welcome h-home, d-darling.” She tripped over her own words a few times as she spun around and blew a kiss whilst taking the exact pose that the other two had had just a minute prior.It was a critical hit. My eyes widened as I stepped backwards with a hand over my chest. If I had a drink, I most certainly would have done a spit take. Keeping my eyes on her was impossible. I had no choice but to avert them else risk completely losing my bearings.“S-See? Did I not tell you that it wouldn’t bode well? I cannot believe I allowed you to trick me into this!”
“No, um…” I tried to correct her, but couldn’t find the words. I was too taken aback. The way she stuttered and blushed as she turned her eyes up on me hit every single one of my sweet spots. And the kiss she blew had struck me right in the heart. The difference between the enchanting appeal and her usual behaviour was so stark that it only served to amplify the strength of her attack. Describing this exact scenario was why the Japanese term “gap moe” had been created.
“W-wow…” said Lyuu as she trembled in fear. “I knew Lefi was the first to steal Master’s heart, but I really didn’t think she’d be this good at it.”
“R-right? T-that was really effective,” agreed Nell, who was apparently now blushing for a whole different set of reasons, “I felt it hit home even though we’re both girls.”The way the hero was looking at the other girl was concerning. She was just as charmed as I was. Wow, Nell. I didn’t know you swung that way. As for Lyuu’s reaction? Yeah, no comment.All three of us would likely have remained stunned by Lefi’s overpowering display had Leila not poked her head out of the kitchen. “Dinner will be ready shortly. Weren’t you supposed to be helping me, Lyuu?”
“R-Right, I almost forgot! I’ll be there in a sec!” The first to recover from the shock was Lyuu, who exited stage left in order to attend to her duties.
“I should probably go get the kids so they won’t be late for dinner.” Next was Nell, who had apparently shook off the CC with her heroic tenacity. The slovenly look on her face found itself replaced by a gentle smile. “I think I know where to find them, so I’ll be right back. Take care of Lefi for me, okay?”
“Y-yeah, sure.”She fiddled with the door in a manner that proved she had grown used to it and closed it behind her as she left. I know I’ve already said this a whole bunch of times, but wow. She really is used to living here now, isn’t she? I mean, that’s fine and all, but it’s also not. I’m kind of hoping she’ll stay the badass hero she is instead of letting all the idiots around here influence and ruin her.And then there were two. Lefi and I were the only two that remained. She was sulking, while I was still doing my damned best not to look at her.A small smile appeared on my lips as I looped around behind her and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Hey, Lefi?”
“…What?” she grumbled.
“Could you do me a favour and do that one more time?” I asked. “Ideally while wearing a maid’s outfit.”
“Absolutely not!”Well then. That’s the hardest refusal I’ve ever heard from her.<– Prev — Next –>

What Exactly Does Blood Taste Like Anyway?
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Thanks Yuki! That was really tasty!” Illuna gave me a big smile as she detached herself from my neck.
“No problem. Glad to hear it.” The sides of her mouth were still covered in a bit of the sanguine fluid, but I paid it no mind and gave the happy young bloodsucker a pat on the head regardless.
“…You know, that doesn’t really surprise me anymore, but it does remind me that I’m the only human here.” said Nell.
“Yeah, I can kinda see where you’re coming from. It’s basically impossible to tell that Illuna’s a vampire unless you see her fangs,” I said. “Though I guess the same can probably be said for me too.”
“Mhm. Your eyes and your hair are kind of a rare colour, but not one that’s unheard of. You look just like one of us so long as you don’t have your wings out.” The hero giggled before looking around. She furrowed her brows, as if deep in thought, as her gaze fell upon each member of my household in turn.First, it fluttered to Leila, who was reading one of the books I’d brought back from the demon realm as a souvenir. It then jumped to Lefi, Lyuu, and Enne. The dragon and warwolf were facing off in a high-stakes game of Othello whilst the sword watched with interest. She’s probably just waiting for one of them to lose so she can take their spot.“Now that I think about it, almost everyone seems to be a different race. The wraiths are the only ones that aren’t.”
“Huh… I’ve never thought about it, but yeah, you’re right. And the wraith girls are more or less a three in one package anyway, so you can’t even really say we have any dupes.”I had summoned the triplets at the same time. But that wasn’t all. You know the concept of the trinity? Yeah, it’s kinda like that. They’re the same, but different.“I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many different types of people in one place before,” said Nell, with a giggle. “And I don’t think any others exist. Humans are far too xenophobic for that. Most of us can’t stand the other races.”
“Yeah, I’m sure all the other humans would be a lot happier if they were as silly and laid back as you are.”
“Silly!? What do you mean silly!?” The brunette puffed up her cheeks in an easy to read expression of indignance and anger.
“Nothing bad,” I chuckled, “It was a compliment.”
“Master.” I felt something tug on my shirt right as I opened my mouth to tease the poor hero again, so I stopped and looked down to see the dungeon’s resident slime girl. “Maaaaster.”Her articulation had improved drastically since she first started learning to speak. It wasn’t quite perfect just yet, however, as her words ended up coming out with a distinctive, childish lisp. Furthering that distinction was the pace at which she spoke. Her sentences were short because she often had to pause to find the right words.“Hey Shii, what’s up?”
“I wanna try drinking some of your blood too!”Oh, okay.…Wait.What?“W-where’d this come from all of a sudden? I’m pretty sure it’s not the type of thing you’d actually enjoy.”
“Illuna told me it’s really tasty! I really really wanna try it!” The slime looked to the vampire, who energetically nodded her head in confirmation.
“Yup! it’s the tastiest thing I’ve ever drank! Even better than fizzy juice!”When Illuna said “fizzy juice,” she actually meant soda. It was something I knew she loved. She jumped for joy every single time I decided to serve it. Wow, didn’t think she actually liked my blood more than soda. I mean, sure, that kinda makes me happy, but it also doesn’t. Because Iunno about you, but I don’t really think that the average Joe enjoys being weighed against a can of Coke.“If it’s that tasty, then I really wanna try it!” said Shii.
“I mean, sure, if you insist,” I said. “Could you trade places with her, Illuna?”
“Okay!”The vampire and the slime pulled a good old switcheroo; one got off my lap, and the other got on.“Thanks! Can I start drinking?”
“I mean, again, I don’t think it’ll taste good, but go for it.”A cool, pleasant sensation assaulted my neck as Shii placed her mouth exactly where Illuna’s fangs had left their mark. Upon craning my head towards her, I was reminded that, unlike Illuna, her body wasn’t opaque. The translucency of her skin and flesh allowed me to observe as she swallowed and digested my vital fluids. The way the two liquids integrated was so strange that I couldn’t help but find it obscene. Thankfully, she had her fill and stopped before I took the thought any further.“Wow! It really was tasty! That was like going to a Michelin three star restaurant!”
“You’ve never even been to a three star restaurant,” I retorted.Man, why do they know all these weird bits of trivia? Who the hell taught them all this useless bullshit? Oh... Right… It was me.“Is it really that good? You sure you’re not just saying that to make me feel better?”
“Yup! It’s really good! I think soda is good too. But this is better!”
“Right?” Hearing the slime reinforce her opinion led the vampire to puff out her chest with a newly validated sense of pride.As long as they’re happy, I guess.“H-Hey, Yuki…?” asked Nell.
“What?”
“W-would you mind if I tried some too?”
“What the hell? Seriously? You too?”I raised a questioning brow at the hero. The way she was fidgeting made it clear that she was well aware she was asking for something bizarre, but she had allowed Shii to influence her into doing it regardless.“It has to be pretty tasty if both of them like it that much, right?” she asked. “Can you really fault me for being just a little bit curious?”
“It’s blood. It’s literally blood. It’s going to taste like blood.”
“But what if it doesn’t? You are a demon lord, after all, right?”I don’t see how that has anything to do with anything.“T-That’s why I uhm… just kinda want to try it. You know, for science.”
“Science? Really…?” I heaved an exasperated sigh. “You know what? Fine.”
My reaction prompted Shii to turn towards the human and grin. “I guess that means it’s your turn next, Nell! Here, have my seat!”
“Thanks Shii!”The slime and the human pulled a good old switcheroo; one got off my lap, and the other got on. Nell’s silky smooth hair brushed against my face. She had gone straight for the prize immediately after stabilizing herself, a task that had involved nothing more than wrapping her arms around my neck and leaning into me. Unlike Shii or Illuna, her figure was developed.Feminine.It was so soft and warm that it appealed to my instincts.The shivers running down my spine didn’t help; my body reacted each time her tongue traced its way down the side of my neck.Pleasure wracked my brain as a sense of immorality overcame me.I could feel the urge to have my way with her bubbling up from within.Nell and I weren’t in that sort of relationship yet.Yet.The ultimate goal of having her stay with us was to foster a romantic relationship to begin with. Which meant there was nothing wrong with doing her. No, stop it, Yuki, you idiot. Calm down man, what the fuck are you thinking? The kids are watching. Stop this before you corrupt them, you dumb horndog!Though I had yet to fully convince myself to calm down, I decided to speak to Nell and try to get her to back away before I totally lost it.“H-hey, Nell? Shouldn’t you already have enough data for that science experiment of yours?”
“Yeah, but being like this is just so comforting. It’s like I’m being embraced by your scent.”Nell, please! You’re really not helping! Are you actually trying to seduce me? For fuck’s sake! I’m pretty sure you’d be singing a whole different tune if you knew what I was thinking right now! Shit!“Nell, you do know I would’ve probably tried to have my way with you already if I wasn’t such a perfect gentleman, right?” I intentionally voiced my concerns in the form of a joke in hopes of her catching on.But she failed to give me the reply I wanted.“It’s okay. I wouldn’t mind if it’s you.” She whispered the words in a sweet, sultry tone, one that only made my urges worse.She wanted me.Just as much as I wanted her.Can I really lose control? Can I really listen to the devil on my shoulder and give in to my urges?Nell raised her head from my neck and pulled back just far enough to stare into my eyes. Her face was red, and her breathing erratic. Slowly but surely, she closed her eyes and began to inch closer. Her pretty pink lips approached. The gap between mine and hers shrank.I felt like I was being drawn in. Before long, I too began slowly bringing my face forward.“Ahem.” The sound of someone clearing their throat brought both of us back down to earth. Upon turning around, we saw Lefi. Or more specifically, an unhappy Lefi.“I will not tell you not to engage in any such activities.” Like Lyuu and Enne, who were standing behind her, the dragon was glaring at us with her arms crossed. “It was I who arranged for the two of you to enter in a relationship, and I see no reason for you not to indulge in such an activity should you choose to become mates. It is one I would expect, even. For that is simply a natural part of romantic involvement.”Neither of us could offer much in the way of a response. We simply remained silent as we reflected on our shameful behaviour.“But conducting yourselves in such a manner in broad daylight is another discussion to be had altogether. What do the two of you think of it? Was there any reason not to have chosen a better place or time?”
“We’re sorry,” we said in tandem.
“Good. Then I will be expecting the two of you to be more selective in the future,” she said as she returned to her board game, minions in tow.
“…Hey, Nell?”
“Y-Yeah?”
“How exactly did my blood end up tasting, anyway?”
“Uhm… S-sorry, but I’m not really sure. My head started to get really fuzzy when I started smelling yo—I mean it wasn’t anything special! You were right. It was blood, and it tasted like blood.”
“…I guess you really are one of us now.”
“Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?” Nell tilted her head in confusion.
“Nothing,” I said as I brushed off the blushing hero’s question with a laugh.Oh, you know. Nothing too special. Just that you’re a bit messed up in the head.<– Prev — Next –>

A Hero’s Anguish
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Oh my gosh! What the heck is wrong with me!?” Nell rolled around on top of the carpet as she bemoaned her actions. “I-I can’t believe I said or did any of that!”The afternoon’s events had left quite the impact on her. The rugged sensation her tongue experienced as it traced its way across his skin was memorable to say the least. She could never forget the stimulus that assailed her nervous system each time he breathed a hot sigh down the back of her neck, nor the way her heart raced as she gazed into his eyes. And then there was his scent. It was so masculine that she felt the urge, the need, to spend every waking moment basking in its embrace.It was like he had branded her. His essence had carved its way into her body and left a permanent mark, one that failed to show signs turning dormant. Even now, it assaulted her and sentenced her to a constant state of anguish.“This is all Yuki’s fault!” she said. “I knew there’d be something weird in his blood!”The hero was convinced that she would normally never engage in an act so obscene, especially not in public. She had only chosen to drink his blood out of curiosity. Seducing him had never been her intention. But his blood had been the devil’s nectar. Ingesting it had intoxicated her. Her head had started to spin for reasons beyond her comprehension the moment she ingested it. A pleasant sensation had washed over both her body and her mind as her ability to reason faded away. She let down her guard and allowed her instincts to be laid bare.“Arrrrrrrrrrrghhh! I’m so embarrassed! I’m so embarrassed I could just disappear!”Being scolded by Lefi had knocked a bit of sense back into her, but it had failed to truly pull her from her stupor. She had remained under the influence for some time after; the drunken effect had only just finished fully wearing off. And that was precisely why she was so embarrassed.Half of her shame stemmed from acting the way she did in a public space. The other half had been generated by her newfound self-awareness.Deep down, that was what she had wanted. Her heart’s desire.Knowing that filled her with a sense of ignominy so insurmountable it made her lose her bearings. She didn’t know what to do with herself. She had no idea how she was supposed to treat her emotions. She didn’t know if she was supposed to let them free, bottle them up, or deal with them some other way.Though she had yet to look into any mirrors, Nell was well aware of the fact that her face was bright as a tomato. She didn’t want anyone to see her the way she was now. Fortunately, she was alone—and unlikely to be intruded on. She had gone out of her way to relocate to her private quarters. Nell wasn’t the only one with a private room. Yuki had made one for each of the dungeon’s residents, but they seemed to go unused for the most part.“…It’s not my fault he smells so good.” Nell came to a stop with her arms and legs spread, and her back against the carpeted floor.Her training had often put her in close proximity with many a man. But none of her other experiences had ever been that up close and personal. And as she had lost her father very early in life, she had no other memories of ever sharing an embrace with a member of the opposite gender. That was in part why the experience had seemed so intense.“…Is that what I think it is?” As she turned her head, she realized that there was a red streak running down the side of her shirt. “It really is…”His blood.The sticky liquid had already worked its way into the fabric and was likely to leave a stain if it wasn’t carefully attended to.But a potential stain was the least of Nell’s concerns.For she had already once again been entranced.She pressed the fabric against herself and inhaled as deeply as she could. “…It smells really, really nice,” she giggled. “Just like him.”Nell was fully aware that she was doing something many would find downright abnormal. But she was alone. There was no one to judge her.And therefore nothing to worry about.Her face slackened into a smile as she took yet another breath.She was so bewitched, so captivated that she even failed to react to the sound of her door being knocked.Only after it opened did she realize that she had made a mistake.“Hey, Nell? It’s time for dinne—” The man on her mind entered the room, only to freeze and then back out the exact same way he came. “…Ooookay. You have fun then,” he said as he closed the door behind him.
“H-huh!? Have fun!?” She echoed his words in a hysterical tone as her mind processed the events that had just unfolded. “Wait! Waaaait! I definitely wasn’t doing what you think I was!” She wrenched the door open as quickly as she could and confronted him before he even so much as took a step.
“It’s okay Nell. I’m not judging, even if sniffing yourself is what gets you off. I was just planning to write it off as another one of your quirks and call it a day.”
“I wasn’t sniffing myself! I was sniffing your blood because there’s still a bit left on m—” Nell’s eyes opened wide in panic. “Wait! Oh my gosh what am I saying!?”Yuki stifled a laugh as the seemingly genuine look of concern on his face warped into a shit-eating grin.Only then did Nell realize that she had been had.“Y-you were just teasing me!?” she squeaked.
“Ehhhh, not really,” he said. “It was more like you set yourself up to be teased, and I just hopped along for the ride.”As much as she wished to deny it, Nell realized that he was right. That was why she stumbled a few steps backward before curling into a ball and covering her face with her hands.“I can’t believe this keeps happening,” she groaned, “I’m so embarrassed. I just want to hole up somewhere and die.”
“Well, I guess I’ll have to loot your corpse then.” The demon lord cackled as he placed an arm under her thigh and another behind her back. It seemed to take him no effort at all to lift her into his arms the same way a prince would lift his princess.
“W-what are you doing!?”
“Escorting you to the table. Like I said, it’s time for dinner.”
“That doesn’t mean you have to carry me there!”
“You say that, but you’d probably be stuck hiding in a corner for god knows how long if I did, so I’m not.” He seemed to have no intention of listening to her, as he began walking down the hallway without bothering to put her down.Her senses fell victim to both his warmth and his scent, the two things that had ultimately caused this entire scenario to begin with. But though it had a record for causing trouble, the fragrance that wafted off his body brought her nothing if not relief.“Oh, come on…” A thousand thoughts swirled through her mind. Though she had ultimately chosen only to vocalize her complaints, she stopped resisting, leaned into his chest, and allowed herself to enjoy the sensation of being rocked in his arms.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Day in Shii’s Life
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerShii was in such a good mood that she skipped and hummed as she wandered around the true throne room.Her joy was almost immediately noticed by the dungeon’s other members. “Hey, Shii. Someone sure looks happy,” said her master as he raised his head from his work.
“Yup! Today was lots of fun!” she replied with an energetic smile.
“Was it? Well, good for you, I guess.” He didn’t quite seem to understand why she was so happy, but he smiled back at her before turning his head back towards the table he was fiddling with. He was too engrossed in whatever he was doing to ask any questions.That said, the slime wouldn’t have had any real answers even if he had chosen to continue the conversation. Because today hadn’t been anything special. The true throne room looked the exact same way as usual.Yuki was fiddling with something while the rest of the adults handled the laundry. Leila, Lyuu, and Nell worked on it with practiced hands, while Lefi struggled to make any progress. Her handiwork was much cruder than everyone else’s, and she took far more time to deal with each article of clothing. She was frustrated by her own inabilities that she groaned every time she looked at the other girls’ piles.Lyuu had started out the same way. She too had been absolutely terrible at doing housework, but the time she had spent under the other maid’s tutelage had eventually paid off. She wore the smuggest of expressions as she showed off the skills she had worked so hard to master and brazenly gave the dragon the very same pointers she had been given in the past.Both the other girls were well aware of Lyuu’s “capabilities.” That was why they did nothing but smile awkwardly as they watched the situation unfold.Like the adults, all the other children were also occupied. Enne was sitting beside Yuki and watching him as he worked, while Illuna was napping in Leila and Lyuu’s bedroom. She had spent the better part of the morning playing with Shii and the wraith girls. But unlike the others, Illuna didn’t have limitless stamina. That was why she often napped after lunch in order to recharge her energy for all the fun to come in the afternoon. Leila was well aware of the vampire’s habit, which was why she had set up an extra bed for her in her room for this exact scenario.It was perfectly normal day. And Shii loved every last bit of it.“I did it! I finally fucking did it!” Yuki interrupted the room’s relative silence with a loud shout as he shot to his feet and raised the object he had been fiddling with above his head. This too was normal. Yuki would always shout with excitement the moment he finished any of his creations. To Shii, it seemed as if he enjoyed the act of creating things just as much, if not more than he enjoyed the process’ results.“What is it?” Enne tilted her head in confusion as she looked at the small table he was holding in the air. The wooden construct was tiny. Both its horizontal and vertical dimensions roughly matched the length of an adult’s forearm.
“It’s a game, one I’m calling Super Paper Bros.”
“Wow…” The sword clapped a few times as for emphasis as she gave the supposed game a fixed stare. Shii knew that, though it may have looked like Enne had understood the demon lord, she, in fact, had not.
“Again?” Lefi sighed as she finished folding the last piece of laundry in her pile and walked over to observe the creation. “What sort of silly device is it this time?”
“Silly? Silly, my ass. I bet you’ll be taking that back as soon as you see what it does,” said the demon lord.He confidently strode over to an area not covered by carpet and placed his creation onto the floor.“Alright, so here’s how it works. First, you gotta find yourself some of these,” he said as he placed a three-dimensional paper model onto the table.
“And what, precisely, is that meant to be?” asked Lefi. “I see not but an odd-looking monster.”
“What do you mean, odd-looking monster? It clearly looks exactly like Rir,” he said in a matter-of-fact tone. “Don’t you see how bushy its tail is? What else could it possibly be?”
“It really is him,” said Enne as her eyes widened ever so slightly.
“…I fail to see the resemblance,” said Lefi. “What say you, Nell?”
“Uhm…” The hero paused for a moment to stare. “I don’t really see it either. It kind of just looks like a random monster to me.”Unlike the demon lord’s wives, Shii had immediately recognized that the paper construct had been shaped after one of her friends, but she chose to remain silent as opposed to contributing to the conversation because she didn’t have much else to add.“I don’t really get how you guys don’t see it, but whatever. It doesn’t matter anyway.” The slime’s master shrugged as he placed a second paper model on top of the table before tapping one of its edges. “Enne, could you do me a favour and place your hands right here?”
“Mmk.”Enne followed his instructions and placed her hands just outside the circular ring that spanned most of the table’s surface area.“Now channel your mana into the table and try making it flow towards Rir.”
“He moved!” Enne’s eyes went wide as she realized that her magical energy had caused the paper model to react. Though she had yet to be prompted to do so, she began experimenting with it by manipulating the flow of her mana. The model reacted accordingly and performed a different action each time she tried something new.“And what, precisely, is this item’s purpose?” asked Lefi, skeptically.
“To let you move things around with magic, of course. Does it look like it does anything else?”
“…Is that it?”
“Yup.”
“…”The dragon stared blankly in stunned silence, but Yuki paid her no mind as he went back to showing off his latest invention. “This thing was a huge pain in the ass to make.” He sat down opposite Enne and put his hands on the table as he once again started to speak. “I had to fiddle with a few of the magic circuits and make them function like electrical circuits without screwing them up. Now, they’re capable of carrying magical energy throughout the table. Then I had to set up the models so they’d be able to have magic transferred to them through induction so that they’d actually move properly when you put mana into the table, and that required a whole slew of workarounds.” The demon lord tapped one of the paper figures on the head. “But it was worth it. These things have some pretty well tuned controls now. Using these things to face off against each other’ll put playing with action figures to shame.”“It is moments like this one that make it difficult for me to evaluate whether you are too intelligent or idiotic for me to understand,” said Lefi.
“Well, I’m glad you’re finally recognizing me for the genius I am,” said Yuki. “You see, my skills may be geared towards making weapons, but I’m not a blacksmith. I can do much more than just that.” He smirked before turning towards his sword. “Alright Enne, you and me, let’s do this. The first person to knock the other’s Rir out of bounds wins.”
“…I won’t lose.”
“Yeah, right. Come on, Rir, let’s show this noob what we can do!”
“My Rir is stronger.”
“Heh, you think you can beat me? Hell no. We’re on my turf. I made this game. I know it better than everyone else here combined, and we’re using the same character, which means pure skill is all that matters. I’m totally going to kick your sorry a—what the hell!?” Yuki’s jaw dropped. “What kind of Witch Time perfect dodge bullshit was that!? That totally should’ve hit!”
“Too easy,” said Enne.
“Jokes on you, it’s not over yet! The best part of this game is how much higher the skill cap is than anything else we’ve got. Now watch this! My Rir’s totally going to ki—get rekt!? What kind of kung fu flying kick bullshit was that!?”
“Too. Easy,” repeated the sword maiden.It didn’t take long for the demon lord’s character to get sent flying off the edge of the table.“I can’t believe it… I can’t believe I just lost to a total beginner…”
“I win.”Enne stood up from the table, made a peace sign with one of her hands, and pointed it at her opponent. Like his weapon, the demon lord had also stood up, but only to demonstrate the extent of his shame by falling onto his hands and knees in despair.“That seems really fun for something so simple,” said Nell. “Can I give it a try?”
“Go for it,” said Yuki in a quiet, disheartened tone. “Losers like me ain’t got jack to say. The only thing we can do is hang our heads in silence and take our leave.”
“Get good. Then try again,” said Enne.
“You two sure are always on the same page when it comes to things like this.” Nell smiled awkwardly as she took Yuki’s place at the table. She immediately began pouring her magical energy into the device, only to panic as she realized that controlling her character was much more difficult than she had imagined. “H-huh!? Why isn’t it moving the way I want it to!?”The most she could get it to use splash. But nothing happened.“…Easy,” said Enne.”
“Aw… I lost. This a lot harder than it looks, but it’s still really fun.”
“Right?” said Yuki.
“…Is it really that difficult?” asked Lefi, doubtfully.
“Well, how about you take it for a spin and find out? I bet you’re bad,” said the demon lord. “In fact, I bet you’re so bad even I could kick your ass, let alone little Ms. Grandmaster over there.”
“You dare challenge me?” The dragon narrowed her eyes into a glare. “Very well. I shall put you in your place.”Enne and Nell swapped places with Yuki and Lefi.“Alright, Rir, let’s kick their asses!” said Yuki.
“Hah!” huffed Lefi. “A more absurd declaration I’ve never heard! Now behold as I crush you in your very own gam—what!?” Lefi’s eyes opened wide as soon as she sat down and attempted to take control of the paper wolf. “Why is it refusing to obey my commands!?”
“Told you you’d suck!” Yuki laughed as he immediately made use of her predicament to secure victory. His wolf lowered its head and used the flat top of its muzzle to shove its foe off the stage. The way its limbs moved was so natural that an unknowing onlooker might have come to the assumption that the paper creature had gained a life of its own. “Well well well, what do we have here? You was going on about all dat good shit about puttin’ me in my place, but you got owned, son! Welcome to the real world! Time to learn, you gon’ learn today!”The smile on her master’s face was one Shii knew well. He smiled a lot, but the one he had on now was his happiest. And it was reserved only for the silver-haired dragon. She was able to bring out much more of his joy than anyone else, regardless of the activity. Shii was happy for the both of them. But she was also a bit jealous. Because she knew that it meant Lefi was more important to him than everyone else, herself included.“…You did not achieve victory,” said Lefi in an indignant tone. “You were given it. I only lost because I, the Supreme Dragon, allowed you a handicap and refused to use the full extent of my power. But now, I have warmed up. You shan’t win again!”
“Bullshit!” Unfortunately for her, the dragon’s excuses fell on deaf ears; her husband wasn’t having any of it. “If that’s not a lie, I don’t know what is. I know you’re bad at this kind of shit. The only thing you know how to do is smash things with brute force! Precision and control are way outside your skillset! Sure, you may be the strongest thing ever, but that doesn’t mean you’re better at literally everything. Us normal people have our strengths too, and as you can see, we can totally use them to whoop your ass into next week!”
“Uhm… Yuki?” Nell smiled awkwardly as she joined in the conversation. “I’d just like to point out that you’re about as far from being a normal person as far can be. Your mana pool is ridiculous, and your spells are so over the top that I think seeing them would make most normal people faint from shock.”
“You say that, but Lefi’s so much stronger than me she makes me look like any other Tom, Dick, or Harry. Compared to her, I might as well be normal.”Lefi, who was clearly vexed by the result of her first battle, began to practice as the other two conversed. “This is nothing before my might! I simply need to inject more of my power and force it to abide by my will!”She did exactly as she had described and began to pour her energies into the table.Only to stop as her character’s head exploded.“…I believe I may have made a slight error.”
“What the hell!?” Yuki, who had turned to the side to face his conversation partner, spun around the moment he heard the pop. “Lefi…? Why were you pouring so much mana into Rir…?”
“I-I did nothing of the sort. I put in only a fraction of my power.”
“And blew our poor pet’s head off. Seriously, what the hell did you expect to happen?”
“I-it is not my fault. It is yours. You should not have made him so fragile.” she declared, indignantly. “Were you not supposed to be the ‘Demon Lord of Creativity?’ I see no reason for you to be deserving of such a title if you remain incapable of constructing a vessel capable of handling the full extent of my power.”
“So first you break it, then you blame me? Talk about shameless,” Yuki rolled his eyes. “You know what? Fine. Challenge accepted. Now follow me, we’re going over there.” He pointed towards the desk he had been sitting at prior to declaring his project complete.
“And why would I have to do that!?”
“Because you literally just asked me to make something for you. If you want it to work, someone’s going to have to test it. And guess what? The only person with as much mana as you is you.”
“Curses…” muttered Lefi, under her breath. “I did not think my statement would rile him to this extent…”The dragon didn’t seem all too keen on following through with the demon lord’s suggestion, so he grabbed her by the scruff of the neck and dragged her over to his desk before she could escape. It took very little time for them to get to work; their minds had ventured into the realm of magical engineering the moment they sat down. The transition was so sudden that it led Shii to giggle.The noise caused Nell to turn towards her in realization. “I’m sorry I didn’t ask earlier, but would you like a turn, Shii?”
“You can take my spot,” offered Enne.
“Nope! I just wanna watch,” smiled the slime.
“Are you sure? I really don’t mind,” said Nell.
“Yup! I like watching!”Watching was what Shii liked best. She enjoyed joining the others in having fun, but not if it meant taking someone else’s place. Because to her, watching was just as fun as playing. And sometimes, even more.“Ok. Then let’s go again, Enne!” said Nell.
“I’ll go easy on you.” Enne handed Nell the undamaged paper Fenrir. “You can have this one. I’ll take the one missing a head.”
“You’re definitely going to regret that,” said the hero. “Because I’m going to kick your butt this time!”Shii spent the rest of the day observing the many games that the dungeon’s other residents indulged in. Though she had many chances to join in on the action, she chose to pass them off so that she could continue to bask in the joy that was her family’s happiness.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: An Observant Pet
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerMy master is nothing if not bizarre. I entertained a thought as I watched the Lord I served bury his face in my fur.“You’re so fluffy, Rir. Your fur always feels amazing,” he said. “Wait, are you grooming yourself before you show up because you know I always do this?” He lifted his head and instead began running his fingers along the length of my coat. “Now that’s just cute.”I knew what my purpose was. It had been carved into my mind the moment I was born. I was a weapon, one created to chase down trespassers and cull them with my fangs. To spearhead assaults against any my master defined as his enemies. I was to live by my duty. And one day die for it.“Yup! Rir’s super cute!” The one my master thought of as his sister, the humanoid cub I’d known since my birth, stroked my head as she spoke words heavily influenced by his. She too was one I knew not to defy. I had always recognized her as a sort of secondary master, another lord to whom I was sworn.The two showed no signs of stopping. It was up to me to steer them back on track. I barked once to ask my master about the day’s business.“Business? Oh, I didn’t call you for business,” he said. “Unless you count play as business.”I was stunned into silence. I had been expecting orders, but my master had brazenly declared that there was no work to be had. Sometimes, I can’t help but wonder if my master truly understands my purpose.Although I appreciated the affection, it was so far divorced from my duty that it left me perplexed.“Hey, look! It’s Rir!”
“Mhm.”A second group began to approach as my masters pet me all over. It came from the castle, and was composed of three individuals. The first was another cub, a slime I’d never seen without a smile. The second appeared to be of a similar age. But unlike the other cubs, her expression was one to remain static. In truth, she was completely unlike the other younglings. She was far more powerful, for her true identity was that of my master’s blade. The final member of the group was an adult, a dragon who stood far above any other.As I looked upon the many faces that approached, I recalled a realization I had come to. A large number of different individuals—and species—had gathered around my master. And that he and I were the same.I had never sought companions. And yet, I had become the leader of a veritable legion of monsters. My master had even thrown four of his own into the mix, four that, like me, were weapons who served no other purpose but to guard his domain. I had many duties. Too many duties. There was so much work to be done that I couldn’t help but feel stressed.Yet, my master was not. He showed no signs of exhaustion despite his workload being just as heavy, if not heavier than my own. I was unsure if he was so capable that he could handle it all with ease, or if he simply didn’t feel the need to care. My observations seem to indicate that it is more likely the latter than the former. But no good will come of doubting my master. I’d best forget I’d ever even considered the possibility.“Oh, look, you’re finally all here. And it seems we’ve even got someone I wasn’t expecting along for the ride too.”
“Indeed. The children asked me to join them, and I found myself incapable of turning down their request.”
“Yeah, I can see that.”My master laughed as he turned to address the children.“Well, girls? What’d you want to play today?”
“I wanna ride Rir!” said the vampire.
“Me too!” said the slime.
“Me three. Riding him is fun,” said the sword.
“Well, Rir, you heard ‘em.”I suppose I have no other choice. The master’s were absolute, so I crouched and allowed the little ones to climb onto my back.***“Thanks Rir. Couldn’t have done it without you.”My master gently placed one of his hands on my shoulder. The other was occupied by his sister, who had been exhausted by our time together. The grip he had on her hand was the only thing that kept her steady as she drifted between a state of alertness and one of rest.The compliment he had said to me was one that I enjoyed. I felt fulfillment in knowing that I had proven myself useful. But knowing it had stemmed from a task as simple as playing around with a few pups left me feeling as awkward as I was content. But in the end, the latter of the two emotions surfaced above the other. I had justified the task as fulfilling another one of my master’s orders. And knowing that was enough for me to unabashedly bask in the satisfaction of being praised.“See you later, Rir!” said the slime.
“Bye,” said the sword.The little ones waved at me as they followed my master back towards the castle. But after a few steps, he realized that a member of his party had yet to move, so he span around to address her.“You coming, Lefi?”
“I will, but only after I settle an order of business. I will have to ask you to take care of the children in my place.”
“Uhhh… Sure, alright.” He was confused, but chose to leave without questioning her.There was a moment of silence. The dragon stood stock still until she had confirmed that my master had returned to the castle. She then examined our surroundings. Only after confirming that we were alone did she suddenly bury her face in my side.I was so shocked by the action that I whined in bewilderment. But she paid me no mind.“The sensation of your fur truly is superb. I see now why the others are so fond of it.” She continued to rub her face in my side until she was satisfied, at which point in time she shot me a glare. “Do not ever inform any of the others of the events that just took place if you do not wish to suffer the consequences.” The dragon spoke in a low, threatening growl. “Have I made myself clear?”I smiled awkwardly as I nodded to affirm my understanding.The dragon was far older than I or any of the others. And yet, she often conducted herself as would one of the pups. And that was, in my eyes, the reason she had become my master’s mate. The two were very much alike.“Excellent. Then I bid you farewell, Rir. I know that there will be no end to the troubles and challenges that you must face given your master’s peculiar nature, but I trust that you will continue to do your best for him in spite of his foolishness.”With a grin, the dragon turned heel and left for the castle.My encounter with her had once again reminded me that this dungeon’s residents were bizarre in nature, a reminder whose message only grew more powerful as I gazed upon the castle, its towers and walls lit with the orange glow of the evening sun.They are strange. But I am one of them. A strange pet who is willing to continue following his strange master’s every whim.And as the thought crossed my mind, I began to smile.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: No Man Was Never A Cute Little Boy— Part 1
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“W-w-w-w-wha!?” A series of incoherent sounds flubbed from my mouth as I stared at what was supposed to be my body. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Everything was tiny. Wrong. It couldn’t have been me.My muscles were gone. My biceps, my calves, and my abs had all vanished into the void. Every trace of muscle had been replaced by soft, supple flesh one would typically find on an organism that had yet to mature. And that was exactly what I had become. My newfound form was emphasized by the relative size of my nightwear. My arms and legs only went halfway through their respective sleeves.Something was wrong. I was, at most, the size of a second or third grader.“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?” Rather than alleviating my frustrations, screaming at the top of my lungs did nothing but serve to further them. There were no traces of masculinity left in my voice. I’d gone from being a man to a high pitched squeaker. Seriously! What the fuck is going on!? How the hell did this happen!?…Alright, Yuki, deep breaths. Stop panicking and use your head.The first thing I confirmed was that this wasn’t a dream. That much I knew for sure; my sense of touch was as present and vivid as ever. Unlike dreams, real life was at least somewhat logical. Whatever happened had to have happened for a reason. Alright, I know I’ve got this. I’ve become an adult stuck in a child’s body, which means I’m not just plain old Yuki anymore. I’m Detective Yuki now—this case is good as closed.Now here’s the play: if my understanding of pop culture is correct, then I probably shrank because I ended up drinking some sort of weird ass concoction. Hmm… that does sound kinda familiar. Wait a second! I remember!My expression froze up like a shocked rodent’s as I recalled the previous night’s events.***It all started when I decided that it was time for me to go through my inventory and do a bit of cleaning. That, in and of itself, was nothing out of the ordinary. I was going to throw out everything I didn’t want and reorganize everything I did.“The fuck is this…?” That was when I came across an item that could only be described as suspicious. Not even Analyze had cleared up any of my questions.***
Name: Mysterious Potion
Quality: S+
Description: A mysterious potion with a mysterious taste and mysterious effects.
***Unlike most of the other stuff in my inventory, I had absolutely no idea where the potion at hand had come from. I didn’t recall ever picking up anything even remotely like it. A part of me had been tempted to chuck it out the window and be done with it given its shady nature, but I ultimately decided against the idea because it seemed wasteful given the item’s ridiculously high quality rating.“The heck is that, Master?” asked Lyuu, who happened to be nearby.
“Iunno. I found it in my inventory, but I’ve got no idea where it came from,” I said. “You wanna try giving it a swig or two?”
“What’s it do?”
“No idea.”
“Could y’please not try poisonin’ me?” she frowned, but I shook off her complaints with a laugh.
“I was just kidding,” I said. “Though, on second thought, I’m actually kinda tempted to chug it now, just to figure out what it does.”
“U-uhmmm… I’m pretty sure that ain’t a good idea, Master,” said Lyuu.
“I mean, you’re probably right.” I grabbed a few potions out of my inventory and placed them on the table in front of me. “But I’m sure I’ll be fine with all these lying around.”
“Oh, those things! I remember them being real effective.”
“Yeah, plus, if worse comes to worst, Lefi’ll probably have a fix for it.” I turned towards the dragon, who happened to be lazing around nearby. “You hear that, Lefi?”
“What? I was not paying attention.” She lazily turned to face me after hearing her name.
“I’m going to do something stupid, and you’re going to have to bail me out if I screw myself.”
“Very well,” she said.With my contingency plan signed and approved, I raised the potion to my lips and chugged the whole thing down in one breath.***“Fuck! Why am I so fucking stupid!?” Again, I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was my fault. Entirely, my fault. None of this would have happened if I had done as any normal person would and erred on the side of caution.The potion hadn’t taken effect immediately, so at the time, I’d written it off with a laugh. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected to rear its ugly head and bite me in the ass the next day. Its effect was so silly that I wanted to bash my head against the wall. Why the actual fuck would someone make something like this?As much as I wanted to blame the creator, I knew that the blame ultimately lay with my dumb ass for opting to drink it without first uncovering its effects. Welp. Turns out Lyuu was right…“I am trying to sleep…” Lefi groaned as she got up from the bed beside mine. One of her hands was held against the side of her head to demonstrate an apparent migraine. “Why is it that you are shouting so incessantly so early in the morning?”She rubbed her eyes and turned towards me, only to stop. Time almost seemed to come to a standstill as she stared with her jaw slackened. Once she recovered, she examined me from head to toe and even did a full circle around me for added effect before collapsing back onto her bed and roaring with laughter as she rolled about.“I see that you have shrunk, Yuki,” she cackled. “What an interesting choice.”I knew Lefi more than well enough to guess her thought process. She had started in a state of bewilderment, so she had analyzed me and confirmed that I was who my character sheet said I was before embracing the situation’s hilarity.“Shut up! Stop laughing! This isn’t a joke, it’s a problem! And a pretty serious one at that!” Despite my protests, the dragon girl chose not to take me seriously.
“This form of yours is certainly quite adorable in its own right,” she said as she reached towards me and pat me on the head. “I suppose it is now my turn to leverage the advantage of height.”
“Stop that!” I brushed her hand away, but the action failed to do anything beyond escalating her advances. “Wait! What the fuck! I said stop! What the fuck are you doing!?”I tried my best to escape, but she wrapped her arms around my waist and pulled me into a seated position atop her lap before I could. “The manner in which you are shouting profanities does not coincide with your form. But that too bears its own charm,” said the dragon. “I see no reason for you not to remain as you are now in perpetuity.”Unlike me, Lefi was in a great mood. She continued patting me on the head with one of the biggest smiles I’d seen on her in a while. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t escape. The one advantage I normally had over her, my size, was gone.“Fuck that! I am not staying like this. And for fuck’s sake, stop petting me already!”
“Now, now, it is best for you to calm yourself, Yuki. You are prone to incurring an injury should you continue to flail about.”
“Graaagh!?” I squealed as the air was squashed out of my lungs. “Stop that! You’re gonna kill me if you keep squeezing me that hard goddammit!”
“It will do you no harm if you do as any obedient child should and remain still.”
“Stop talking to me like that! I’m not a fucking kid!”And so, our banter continued until every single one of the dungeon’s residents was roused.***“Yuki…? That is you, right?” asked Nell curiously.
“Yuki’s dead.”
“H-huh?”
“Yuki. Is. Dead.”
“Hey, Lefi? What happened to him? Why’s he so small now?” As I wasn’t being very cooperative, the hero redirected her question towards the dungeon’s resident dragon.
“He has become quite adorable, has he not?” The dragon, however, also wasn’t all that interested in answering the hero’s question. She was too busy heavily investing in my misfortune. “Would you like to give holding him a try? It is an action I am sure you will find rather enjoyable.”
“Uhm… Sure.”I sat lifelessly as Lefi picked me up off her lap and plopped me on Nell’s. The degree of ease with which she carried out the action frustrated me to no end, but there was literally nothing I could do about it.“You know what? I think you’re right,” said Nell as she ruffled my hair. “He really does seem kinda cute this way.”
“God fucking damn it…” Though I knew that resistance was futile, I tried putting on one last show of disobedience by grumbling under my breath.
“This calls for a cute nickname. What do you think, Yuu?”
“…Don’t know, don’t care. I’m long over this shit.”
“I guess that means I’m calling you Yuu then! Well, Yuu? What happened? Why’d you turn so small? Is it because your tummy hurts?”
“Alright, Nell, look. You can call me whatever the fuck you want, and you can hand me around and treat me like a stuffed animal or whatever. I’ve already accepted that all that shit is going to happen,” I said. “But for fuck’s sake, don’t start talking to me like I’m some sorta little kid. ‘Cause that’s getting real irritating real fast.”
“Geez, Yuu, little boys aren’t supposed to swear like that!” she said. “But it is kinda cute, in its own weird way.”
“I had that exact thought during my first interaction with this new form of his,” said Lefi. “It certainly is rather charming.”
“Charming my ass! Stop messing around and help me figure out how I’m supposed to fix this!”
“I see no reason to lend my aid. Was this not all a product of your own decisions?”Uuuuuuuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I mean, she’s not wrong, but, fuck!“Does that mean this is all ‘cause you drank that weird potion I was warnin’ you about last night, Master?”
“I mean, it’s the only thing I can think of,” I grumbled. “Thanks to that, I’m stuck as an adult that looks like a kid. Might as well call me an ace detective and send me out to solve a murder mystery or two.”
“Are you sayin’ that ace detectives should look like kids?” asked Lyuu. “‘Cause I ain’t heard of anythin’ like that before.”
“Yeah, it’s a whole thing,” I said.
“Wow… That’s real weird. I think I’d kinda wanna see one in action, just ‘cause that sounds real interestin’.” Lyuu slowly approached as she contemplated the thought of a tiny master detective, only to grab both my cheeks and pull on them the moment she got within arm’s reach.
“Ow!” I almost jumped out of my seat in response to the sudden stimulus. “Wad da puk wath dat ‘or!?” The assault on my cheeks distorted my words and made them difficult to understand.
“Sorry Master, but your cheeks just looked so soft ‘n squishy that I couldn’t help myself.” She ignored my protests and kept using both hands to mess with my delicate face tissue.
“Are they really that soft…?” asked Nell, as she reached for them. “Wow, they are!”
“It is as you say,” said Lefi, who joined in on the supposed fun. “A truly wonderful sensation, this is.”
“Shtop dat! Sherioushly! Wet gowe off mwe alrweady!”I couldn’t stand having my face pulled in six different directions, so I shouted at them, shook them off, and retreated to a safe distance. “For fuck’s sake!” I straightened my back as far as it would go in order to make myself seem as imposing as possible. “I get it, you girls find this whole scenario entertaining, very entertaining. But that doesn’t me—”My already futile attempt to defend my dignity was cut off before it could even take flight. A fourth assailant tackled me from behind in the middle of my speech. Upon spinning around, I found myself confronting the dungeon’s only blonde.“Sorry, Illuna, we’re a bit busy right now. Could you check ba—”
“Yooksie!” Again, I was denied the freedom of speech. The vampire hugged me as she could as she gave me a bizarre nickname.
“Oh great, not you too…”
“You’re littler than me now, so you have to start acting like I’m your sister! Your big sister!”
“I uh…am not sure that’s how that works…”
“Please, Yooksie? Pleeeeeeeease?”
“…Fine. Whatever you say. You can be my big sister or whatever.” I gave in and heaved a tired sigh. Today is going to be a looooooong day.
“Yup, that’s right Yooksie! I’m totally gonna be your big sis now!”Her grip on me tightened as she expressed what seemed more like fulfillment than joy, to which I responded by lifelessly flopping forward.Welp. This is going nowhere.Fuck.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: No Man Was Never A Cute Little Boy—Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Open wide, Yooksie! Here comes the train!”
“Open up.”Illuna and Enne each shoved a spoon in my face as I sat despondently at the dinner table. I already knew that there was no point resisting, so I wordlessly opened my mouth, accepted their deliveries, and chewed.“Is it tasty, Yooksie?”
“…Is it?”
“Yeah… totally…” I said, unenthusiastically. I could feel my soul withering away with every passing moment. “You two are the best big sisters ever…”Evidently, I was the only one to find my circumstances unfortunate. Both the girls pestering me were more than happy to see and interact with my newfound form. I’d more or less expected Illuna to respond the way she had, but seeing Enne do the same came as a bit of a surprise. Evidently, they’d both wanted to be on the opposite end of being taken care of and babied, and I’d ended up at just the right size for them to paint me as the target they needed to vent their desires.Unlike literally everyone else, Shii hadn’t reacted to the change in my stature. She continued to treat me the exact same way she always had, and even seemed to be bewildered by how the others were acting. Her confusion led me to recall that, though she had eyes, they were quite literally just for decoration. I wasn’t really sure how she saw at all, let alone how she saw my newfound size. Her perspective was different from ours. There was a good chance she thought that shrinking was not really all that different from trimming one’s hair. You know, I’m not anywhere near as curious or learned as Leila is, but I’m really starting to wonder just how the world looks through Shii’s eyes. “Watching you four is really putting a smile on my face. You’re just so cute,” giggled Nell, who happened to be sitting across from us. “It’s a real shame you aren’t smiling, Yuu, that’d make you even cuter.”
“Yeah, not happening,” I grumbled. “The moment I start smiling is the moment I start bleeding out of literally every orifice.”
“W-wow. I didn’t know you were that unhappy.”That’s some Grade A Bullshit right there.Although I had no idea how I was supposed to get back to normal, Lefi unsurprisingly did. A bit of questioning was all it took for her to explain what was going on. My magic eye couldn’t tell the difference between my current and usual states, but she could apparently see right through the potion’s effects. Its magical energy had remained dormant in order to circulate through my magical pathways and invade my body like a virus. Once its incubation period came to pass, it activated and began eating away at my mana, which for reasons that not even she could explain, turned me into a kid.Long story short, I was sick. The only way for me to get back to normal was to sit around and wait for my body to recover, which it apparently mostly had. Her diagnosis appeared to indicate that I was to be freed from hell by tomorrow morning at the latest. Double-checking with Leila confirmed that there was little for me to worry about. The ever-knowledgeable sheep girl had professed that potions like the one I’d drank never lasted for long.I was grateful. Even the thought of remaining as an ace detective for an extended period of time had led my own friend, darkness, to rear his ugly mug. I could already see him on the horizon, hand in hand with clinical depression. Oh… So this is why Shinichi was so desperate to track down the Black Organisation. I get it now…“Wanna go outside and play once we’re done eating breakfast?” asked Illuna.
“Good idea,” said Enne.
“Sure… Whatever you two say,” I heaved a sad sigh. “No good little brother would ever say no to his big sisters, after all.”/wrist***“Get him, girls! He’s right there!”Illuna’s cue led Rui and Lowe, or more accurately the dolls they possessed, to turn in my direction. They glided through the air with all the grace and speed of a pair of figure skaters on ice. But to no avail.“Better think again if you think you can catch Detective Yuki that easily!” All it took for me to evade them was flap my wings and rocket my way into the great blue.
“That’s cheating, Yooksie! Flying isn’t fair!” said Illuna.
“Heh, heh, heh.” I taunted her with a slow, deliberate laugh. “Complain all you want. Nothing’s changing.” I continued to fly around and make liberal use of my wings to evade my pursuers as I spoke. “This tiny ass form is more than just suffering. It’s my Speed Forme. Ain’t nobody outrunning me when I’m this fast!”
“Fine! If you’re not gonna play fair, then we’re just gonna have to beat you by putting our heads together and combining our powers!” declared the vampire.
“Try it, try it and weep as you fail!” My words came with a smirk. “No good will come of you working together!” I crossed my arms and broke into a deranged, maniacal cackle, all while continuing to evade capture.
“Alright everyone, let’s all charge at the same time!” said Illuna. “Ready? Go!”The first three to close in on me were the triplets. Their approach was well structured. They were so well coordinated that they managed to approach me from three different directions simultaneously. They were tunnelling me in order to cut down on the number of ways I could escape them.My only option was to go down towards the ground. So I did. I closed my wings and allowed myself to freefall until I was on the verge of eating dirt. Only then did I kick myself into gear. I gave my wings a great flap and boosted myself forwards. The ground and I ran parallel. I shot from left to right and right to left. A trail of zigs and zags followed me through the weeds as I tore through the overgrown greenery.Losing most of my body came with a reduction in mass. I was more agile. I’d become capable of pulling off twists and turns sharp enough to kill. No normal children could have possibly kept up with my high-speed maneuvers—not that the dungeon was home to any such individuals.Flying low, while thrilling, was by no means an optimal choice. Because it meant putting myself within reach of the wingless, the most threatening of which was the literal living sword. Enne’s blade form was on par with the most powerful weapons known to man. And her incarnate form wasn’t all that far behind. As a humanoid, the blade was capable of demonstrating such speed and finesse that she could put even the most confident adult to shame.Evasive maneuvers meant nothing to her. She read me with pinpoint accuracy, leapt through the air, and set herself up to land right in front of me. Though she was a fearsome foe, I was still one step ahead.Becoming a child had nothing to mitigate the overwhelming power I possessed as a demon lord. Neither my kinetic vision nor my reaction speed had taken any hits. I was able to spot Enne out of the corner of my eye as she leapt at me from what should have been a blind spot, spin around in midair, and ward off her dropkick before catching her and lightly placing her on the ground in order to make sure she didn’t get hurt.“Too bad, Enne. You’re going to need to do more than j—”
“Shii! Now!”
“Okay!”My patented child-protection technique took less than a second to execute. Still, it created an opening, one that the girls were more than willing to take advantage of. Upon spinning around, I found myself greeted by a facefull of blue. Shii had returned to her slime form and plastered herself all over my head.“W-what the!?”Enne wasn’t the only one to read me. Illuna had too. She’d known that I was going to open up my mouth and blab the moment I bested Enne. And that was my downfall. Having a slime stuck to my face stopped me from perceiving my surroundings, so I ended up hitting the breaks and coming to a standstill a few feet above the ground.It was over. Both the wraith girls and Enne swarmed me before I could recover. Just between you and me, I totally coulda had that in the bag. My Crisis Detection skill let me see Shii coming from a mile away, but dodging her and foiling Illuna’s strategy seemed no different from calling the fun police, so I decided not to.“Arrgghhh!?” I screamed in mock confusion as I initiated a tailspin that brought me all the way down into the weeds, after which Illuna delivered the finishing blow by leaping onto my already over-encumbered frame.
“And that’s one Yooksie freshly caught and ready for market!” she giggled. “Too bad for you, Yooksie! Little brothers can never get away from their big sisters!” She flashed a cross between a happy smile and a shit-eating grin as she declared me the loser.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” I chuckled. “I should’ve known that there was no point in standing up to someone older than me.”
“What are we doing next, master?” asked Shii.
“Hmmm… Well, I’ve had enough tag for now, so what do you say we mess around a bit in the sandbox?”
“That’s a great idea! let’s go right away!” said Illuna.
“Mhm. Good idea,” echoed Enne.While the wraiths weren’t capable of vocalizing their agreement, they still found themselves with the ability to demonstrate their enthusiasm by waving their arms energetically as they spun circles around me. As there were no objections, I turned towards the park-like area I’d transformed the castle’s garden into and began leading the girls on a jolly old march. I was happy, they were happy, we were all happy.Everything was going great.Or so it seemed.“Wow, Master, you seem to be havin’ an awful good time for someone who was screamin’ about how much he hated gettin’ turned into a kid.”I froze up. My neck creaked as would a rusty old hinge as I slowly turned my head to face the dog-eared maid. If her words hadn’t made it obvious that she was judging me, her expression definitely did. I couldn’t bring myself to meet her eyes. They were too accusatory. Even a single glance was enough to fill me with shame.“O-oh, hey Lyuu. D-didn’t notice you there. W-what’s up?” I stuttered, nervously.
“I was just finishin’ up the laundry,” she said. “But then I heard you guys shoutin’. It sounded like you were havin’ plenty of fun, so I thought to come see what you were up to.” A smug grin appeared on her face. “It seems like turnin’ into a kid’s done a lot to you, Master. I didn’t think you’d regress to the point where you started havin’ fun talkin’ about how much of a kid you are compared to everyone else. I even heard you callin’ Illuna and Enne your big sisters a few times.”
“S-shut up! You think I had a choice!? I’d nev—”
“Awww… So you don’t want us to be your big sisters?” Said Illuna with a sad frown.
“T-That’s not what I meant,” I said, panicked. “It’s just, you know… I uh… yeah…” I tried to come up with a plethora of excuses, but failed to come up with anything decent.
“Wow, Yooksie, you’re real mean. Boys shouldn’t be pickin’ on girls and makin’ ‘em cry, y’know?”
“Do not call me that! I don’t need you hopping on the bandwagon too, goddammit!”
“You know, Master, as you are now, you’re kinda like the little brother I’ve always wanted.”
Lyuu giggled sadistically as she picked me up off the ground. “You’re kinda annoyin’ and a pain in the butt, but also cute at the same time.” She started rubbing her cheeks against mine as she spoke. “I can see why Lefi ‘n Nell liked messin’ around with you so much.”
“Stop that! The kids are watching, you idiot!”
“The way you’re actin’ all embarrassed just makes you even cuter,” she said as she continued. “Besides, just a little won’t hurt nobody.”
“Seriously, Lyuu! Knock it off! This is not fine! I know I look like a kid right now, but I’m still me on the inside, you know?”All the smothering and nuzzling the wolf girl forced me to engage in ultimately put the two of us in extremely close proximity. The difference in our sizes made both her touch and her scent much more vivid than it had ever been before. It was almost like I was being enveloped by her on all sides and wrapped up in her essence. It was uncomfortable. And yet, not. She was soft. Feminine. Warm.Still, I felt more embarrassed than turned on. Being picked up and carried around in an embrace was already bad enough. My sense of shame was screaming at me, begging me to escape. And the mutual cheek rubbing only made it worse.“I know we ain’t really married yet, and that we won’t be ‘till my dad checks back in a year and makes sure everythin’ is still okay, but we’re still engaged,” she said. “So I don’t think that snugglin’ up to each other is all that much of a problem.”
“I mean, you’re not wrong per se…” I said. Putting it that way actually makes it seem a lot less problematic. Huh…
“That’s right, Yooksie,” said Lyuu. “And that means I can hug you as much as I want.”
“That’s not fair, Lyuu! It was supposed to be our turn to play with Yooksie!” complained Illuna. “You can’t just drop in and start hogging him!”
“She’s right. That’s not fair,” said Enne.
“Sorry girls,” giggled Lyuu. “Alright, I think I’ve had my fill, so you guys can have him back.” She gave me one last hug before she put me down and picked up her laundry basket. “Promise me you’ll all get back inside the castle before it gets dark out, mkay?”
“Mkay!” repeated the slime and the vampire. The sword and the wraiths silently expressed their acknowledgement by nodding and raising their hands respectively.
“Looks like you’re the only one that hasn’t made any promises, Yooksie.”
“Do I really have to…?” I grumbled.
“O‘course you do,” said Lyuu with a shit-eating grin. She stared intently at me, as if to indicate that she had no intention of letting me off the hook.
“Ugh… Fine,” I sighed. “…I pwomise.”I need my fucking body back.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: A Nice, Cozy Bath
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerDusk had come to the dungeon. The cloud-laden evening sky was dyed a brilliant shade of orange as the sun made its way beneath the horizon. Having played their fill, the kids were exhausted. They were more than willing to comply when I told them that it was time to head back for dinner. The thought of food had at least temporarily restored their energy, however, as all six girls ended up in front of me on our way back.Upon tearing my eyes off the dungeon’s pseudo-sky and spinning back towards the door to the true throne room, I found myself struck by a sudden wave of nausea. The world span much more dramatically than it should have from such a shallow turn. The attack led me to raise one hand to my temple and press the other against the nearest wall as I leaned over and groaned.“Master? Are you okay?” Shii happened to turn around right as I somehow managed to fight off the urge to vomit, so she ended up asking me about my condition with a worried gaze.
“…Yeah. …I’m alright.” I managed to squeeze out a few words after a moment’s delay. “…I’m… just a bit dizzy.”I clearly wasn’t okay, but I didn’t want her to worry, so I told her otherwise as I took a series of deep breaths and filled my lungs with much-needed oxygen. Each inhalation seemed to help, even if only a bit. Slowly but surely, the sudden wave of lightheadedness faded away.“What the hell was that…?”A realization overcame me as I opened my mouth to speak. My voice was back. The high pitched squeaks I’d been speaking in just five minutes prior were nowhere to be found.Relief flooded my system as my eyes darted to my arms and legs and confirmed that they had reverted to their original form. Detective Yuki was no more. The case was closed. My woes had finally been banished to the void. The clothes I had been wearing, little boy-sized articles I’d bought with DP, had torn and left me in an unpresentable state, but that was my least of concerns. I was far too preoccupied with the pure joy wrought by my return to bother with something as insignificant as my appearance.“Finally! Fucking! Finally! Real Yuki’s back, baby!” I fell onto my knees, raised my fists, and shouted a cry of victory as would a soccer player after an epic, game-winning goal.The outburst startled my companions. Enne, the first to turn around, reacted with disappointment. She was less than happy to find that she had lost the opportunity to play the role of an older sibling.“You turned back? So Yooksie’s gone?” Likewise, Illuna also broke into a sad frown.
“Yeah, Yookie’s dead as a doornail and gone for good,” I said. “Say goodbye to that dumb brat, and hello to your resident demon lord!”
“Awww… That’s too bad. You were really cute when you were Yooksie.”
“Mhm…”I was feeling a bit bad for the two girls given that they’d been deprived of their fun, but I’d already made up my mind. Yooksie was never coming back. Period. I’ve had way more than enough of that shit for a lifetime.…Alright, fine, I will admit that it wasn’t all bad. I started to enjoy it a bit halfway through, but only because nostalgia was kicking in. It kinda felt like I was reliving my childhood. But still, never again. I’m done.“Congrats, Master!”
“Thanks Shii,” I said. “Anyway, we should get a move on. We can’t eat or bathe if we don’t get back inside the castle.”
“Oh yeah, it’s dinnertime!” said Illuna. “I can’t wait! I’m starving!”With the girls in tow, I kept my head held high as I triumphantly returned to the throne room.***“Oh man, what a day…” I sighed as I allowed myself to sink a bit deeper into the tub. It was the perfect temperature. The hot water vein that ran beneath the bath had been configured such that it was just warm enough to provide me with an environment in which I could kick back and relax after a long day with the kids.By long, I meant long. I had effectively spent the whole day with them. They had even joined me for a quick dip in the bath. The only reason they weren’t still by my side was because they’d gotten too tired or bored to sit around and let themselves soak.Illuna and Shii were the two marked as tired. I suspected that the former had already been tucked in, while the latter had returned to slime form and passed out on her favourite cushion.Enne, on the other hand, had simply been bored. She’d decided that hanging out with the dungeon’s other residents was ultimately a better use of time than sitting around in a tub of water. In other words, she had most likely sought out Leila for a couple games of shogi. Though we had a whole plethora of board games sitting around on the shelves, Enne would almost always pick the classic game of generals over any other. The position it held as her favourite pastime was solid as stone. The sword girl loved challenges and didn’t mind failure. She wasn’t the type of gamer to throw a fit or call hax the moment something didn’t go her way. That was why she always opted to face off against Leila if possible. She never bothered challenging Lefi or any of the other easy wins unless no one else was available. So I know this is only kinda related, but seeing a girl who’s basically dressed in a kimono playing shogi makes for one helluva sight for sore eyes. It’s like the perfect combination of cool and cute, and probably adds a thousand or so to her elo straight up.While we didn’t actually have any elo-based rankings set up, we did have something along the lines of a local leaderboard. The rungs were as follows:1. Leila
2. Illuna
3. Enne
4. Me
5. Nell
6. Lyuu
7. Lefi
8. ShiiThe shogi rankings were fairly reflective of board game skill in general. The top half of the leaderboard quite literally never changed regardless of the game, whereas the bottom half would occasionally shuffle around based on a wide variety of different factors.Leila was naturally the top seat. She was more than capable of outwitting the dungeon’s other residents and crushing them beneath her with nothing more than the power of her mind. Illuna was also surprisingly good at using her head. She was capable of making plays that were so dirty they were borderline demonic, all whilst smiling in as innocent a manner as any child her age. The way she’d bait her opponent in and devastate them was enough to make any overconfident victim pass out on the spot in shock. Just saying, that was just a metaphor. It hasn’t actually happened. Yet.Illuna hadn’t always demonstrated such soul-crushing strength. In fact, she used to be amongst the weaker contenders—at least until I realized that she was just going easy on us. A brief lecture on boardgame manners was all it took to convince her that losing on purpose was, in fact, more discourteous than not. And that was when everything changed; the vampire began plowing her way through everyone that wasn’t named Leila with a smile.Like our all-knowing maid, the young blonde seemed to have a fairly good head on her shoulders. Further evidence of this could be seen from her play. She would typically act as the commander whenever it came time for the girls to do anything involving teamwork or coordination.Another surprising entry was our resident dragon girl. She was notorious for simply being bad. But though Lefi wasn’t exactly what one could call talented when it came to exploring the tabletop realm, she wasn’t actually the worst at it either. Shii was—mostly because the adorable little thing didn’t quite seem to remember all the rules. She would always end up gasping and declaring that she’d messed up after making her move and seeing its consequences. You see, this is why she’s the dungeon’s healer. She’s got both our bodies and our souls as soothed as they get.I put a hand to my chin to contemplate the benefits that we derived from the slime’s presence but was pulled from my thoughts by the rattling of the bathroom door. Spinning around, I found myself witness to a sight straight out of heaven. Three beautiful angels, clad in nothing but towels, had entered the room.Each conducted herself in a unique, easily identifiable manner. Lefi kept her arms crossed and her grin smug. Lyuu was also smiling, albeit in a much more embarrassed manner as she held an arm against her waist. Nell was the most abashed of the three. She directed her gaze towards the floor as she kept both hands on her towel to make sure it didn’t slip.“Wha!?” My jaw dropped as I made a noise that bordered the boundary of incoherence. The way their beautifully shaped limbs, free from excess fat, poked out from beneath their towels was so erotic it started giving me ideas the moment I laid eyes on them. I’d seen Lefi without clothes on so many different occasions that I’d effectively become desensitized to her naked form. But the towel changed everything. The skimpy outfit, if you could even call it that, emphasized the girls’ curves and directed my eyes towards the few parts that were just barely kept out of sight.I soon realized that I was staring, so I forcefully tore my eyes away from the treat before me and repositioned my jaw as to not look like an idiot.“W-why are all of you in here?”
“I see not why you are acting so surprised,” said Lefi. “I was under the impression that we often bathed together.”
“I mean, yes we do. But we don’t,” I said as I directed my gaze at the two behind her.
“L-Lefi pressured us into tagging along,” explained Nell.
“Y-yeah. She just told us that she was gonna join ya, and that we were comin’ too,” agreed Lyuu.
“Do your people not bathe with their mates?” Lefi raised a brow in wonder as she led the trio to the pre-bath showers.
“W-we didn’t really have any huge baths like this where I used to live, so I’m not really sure,” said Nell.
“All we warwolves ever do is drop ourselves in the river and do a little bit of scrubbin’. Bathin’ in a huge space like this wasn’t ever somethin’ we’d ever thought up,” said Lyuu. “But livin’ here’s changed me. I can’t even imagine what life would be like without a bath anymore.”
“I feel the same. I cannot help but feel filthy in every case that I forget to bathe.”The girls’ towels, which had been white to begin with, turned translucent as they were moistened by the shower. And that wasn’t the only thing the water did. Each drop served to make their outfits more skintight. I could sense the man in me rising. But I couldn’t let it. I had to keep calm. Knowing that I was about to lose myself, I once again tore my eyes away from the girls and looked to the grassy plains and the night sky beyond. Alright Yuki, deep breaths. Come on. Let your mind be clear. Calm as the surface of a mirror. And enlightened as a saint. Wait, is it just me, or did a few of those statements seem a bit off? I’m pretty sure they’re more related to martial arts and religion than they are to—oh whatever. Who cares? All that matters is that I calm the fuck down. Not reacting is key. They’re only doing this because they want me to say or do something. Losing control is a big no ‘cause the kids are still around.…Wait. No they aren’t. They’re all either fast asleep or hanging out somewhere else. It’s just me and the women in my life right now. Huh. Weird. That almost never happens. Does that mean that… it’s actually okay for me to lose control for once? That we can use this rare opportunity to do the thing men and women do together when they take off their clothes?Wait. Wait, no. Bad Yuki. Down, boy. Get a grip. You can’t go jumping on people unless they give you the green light.We’re bathing. They’re here because they wanted to wash up. That’s it. This is just a totally normal thing. Husbands and wives get in the bath together all the time, and not necessarily to do the deed. Not that I even really think of Nell or Lyuu as my wives just yet.Lefi was still the only one that I really felt that way about. The other two were more like girlfriends. There certainly was a degree of emotional attachment there. I valued both girls, but didn’t think I was really ready to truly commit to them just yet. We were still in that phase where we were testing the waters to figure out if we were really all that compatible with one another. You know what’s really weird? Calling someone my girlfriend makes me feel way more embarrassed than calling someone my wife. I’m not really sure why.My internal discord was brought to a halt as my back was met with a sensation that could only be described as soft. Incoherent, surprised demon lord noises left my throat as I reacted with a start.“What are you mumbling on about this time?” Lefi’s arms wrapped themselves around my chest as she placed her head on top of my right shoulder. Directing my gaze sideways led me to realize that she was grinning as would a playful imp. She made sure to keep her eyes on my face in order to enjoy whatever reaction I might give her. And give her one I did.She was naked.Butt. Naked.My heart kicked itself into hypershift and accelerated far beyond its normal rate. The sensation of her chest against my back, the warmth of her cheek against mine, and the bliss that came with inhaling her scent all assailed me at once. I’d thought that I was already desensitized, that I’d built up an immunity to Lefi’s antics. But the circumstances being what they were made her usual theatrics infinitely more exciting. You know, now that I think about it, Lefi has always had a bit of an impish side to her. She’s always loved poking fun at me and teasing me whenever I’ve given her the chance.“N-nothing important,” I said.
“Really?” She cocked a brow. “Well, whatever the case, I must say that it is too bad you have lost the form you obtained this morning. You had become quite the adorable thing. But now, you are not. It has once again become impossible for you to be described as cute in any capacity.”
“Oh, well, I’m sorry I’m not cute anymore.” I rolled my eyes. “I can try acting like a kitten and meowing or something if you really feel like you’ve missed out.”
“You have my curiosity piqued, but I must refuse.”The other girls had finished showering and started heading over, so she let go of me with a laugh as she got into the tub and on my lap. Nononononono! That is NOT a good idea right now!“H-hey!”
“Hey what?” she asked.
“What do you mean, what? I should be the one asking you that! What the hell are you doing on my lap!?”
“I fail to see the issue. Is this not precisely what we have always done?”
“I’m pretty sure it’s not!”I could feel it. I could feel every curve, every muscle, every last bit of her firm perky butt as it pressed itself against my legs. I couldn’t let her sit in front of me. For reasons that didn’t need explaining.“I’m starting to get a little bit jealous of how close you two are,” said Nell.
“I think that’s just somethin’ we gotta expect,” said Lyuu. “Lefi’s known Master for much longer than we have.”Both girls slipped into the bath as they spoke. Unlike Lefi, they’d at least kept their towels on. That, however, wasn’t exactly helping. The only thing the thin layers of cloth did was serve to emphasize the girls’ chests, especially since they sat right at the waterline.Thinking of chests reminded me that there was, in fact, a leaderboard for that too, one from which the kids were naturally excluded. It went as follows:1. Leila
2. Nell
3. Lyuu
4. LefiLeila’s top seat was as indisputable as it was when it came to board games. She was simply unrivalled. There was nothing any of the others could do to even come close to putting up a fight. Nell seemed fairly slender when she had clothes on, but actually had a decent pair of knockers. The competition was actually fairly tight when it came to Lefi and Lyuu. Both their chests were of a much more moderate nature. It took a careful side by side comparison for me to discern that Lyuu’s were very slightly bigger. …I’m glad none of the girls can read minds. ‘Cause if they could, I could easily see myself ending up six feet under. Hell, they’d probably take it a step further and bury me in the middle of the forest just to make sure I’d never be heard of ever again.“A-alright girls, you mind telling me what is going on? Because this is really embarrassing, and I’m really fucking confused.”The bathtub was one of the larger models. While the four of us did in fact fit, it was starting to get a little too cramped for comfort. The way everyone’s bodies were basically glued to mine only made things worse. Or in this case, harder.It felt like I was in the middle of a minefield. Even the slightest movement would lead to me touching something I wasn’t supposed to.“W-we’re probably just as embarrassed as you are, but…” Nell’s voice trailed off in the middle of her explanation, so Lyuu took over the role of explaining the status quo.
“It ain’t everyday that we get the chance to spend some time in private with you, Master. I ain’t complainin’ about how things normally are. I still think livin’ here’s real fun, but this, this is different. It’s special, y’know?”The two girls exchanged a glance before smiling shyly.“That, in essence, summarizes my intention,” said Lefi. “I chose to invite them after coming to the realization that this would be one of the few rare opportunities we would have to speak in private.”
“…Fair enough.”Looking back, I realized that our family had grown far beyond my expectations. At first, it had just been Lefi and I, and I’d honestly expected it to stay that way. But things changed as time came to pass. The number of residents had only continued to grow. Personally, I didn’t mind the noise that accompanied the change in the dungeon’s population. We were, in effect, all one big family. We ate together, played together, and lived together. But that was precisely what made it so difficult for the girls and I to find time alone. It was almost never just us.“Speaking of everyone else, how are they? Did Illuna and Shii get to bed?”
“They’re both sound asleep,” said Nell. “And Enne’s off playing shogi with Leila.”
“Yeah, I figured as much,” I said. “Man, I owe Leila big time for all the shit she puts up with.”
“Indeed. this abode of ours likely would not function without her. It is she that keeps lives in line, and she who has allowed us to put this event together,” said Lefi. “Ah, yes. That reminds me, were you not going to wed her? I see little reason for you to leave her as the sole adult estranged.”
“Lefi’s got a real point there, Master. Were you just not gonna marry Leila?”The tone in which they made the suggestion was so casual that I couldn’t help but allow it to elicit an awkward chuckle.“I don’t think it’s right to marry someone because you don’t want to make them feel left out. That just isn’t how that works,” I said.Plus, I’m pretty sure wives are the type of thing that you’re only supposed to have one of. I’m getting the feeling that the girls are starting to get a bit desensitized to this whole harem thing. And I’m not sure I like where this is going.“I think that you two make a good point, but Yuki does too.” Unlike the other two, Nell still seemed to be in possession of her common sense. “I think that this is more about how he and Leila feel about it than how we feel about it.”You tell ‘em girl. See, this is how normal people are supposed to react.“Nell, I’m just going to go ahead and say that I’m really glad you’re here right now.”
“Huh? Where’d that come from?” she asked, puzzled.Rather than answering the question, I chose to laugh it off as I went back to facing the forward direction.Warmth embraced me from all sides.It was comfortable.Extremely comfortable.Just having them near me put me at ease.Even my heart, which had been beating at a thousand miles a minute, had slowed itself down to something just a tiny bit faster than its usual pace.A strong emotion slowly worked its way through me. It was bliss. Happiness in its purest form. Alright, so I know thinking this while I’m literally surrounded by women is going to make me sound like some sort of degenerate, but I gotta do it. Having a bunch of girls touch you all over feels super good.I could, quite literally, feel their affection.Their love.Knowing that they were girls that had promised themselves to me only served to elevate the sentiment whirring about within my chest.We were just messing around, nestling up to each other, and talking about whatever. But that alone was enough to make it feel as if I had everything I ever needed. Like I had been fulfilled.After a brief moment of silent reflection, I raised my arms, wrapped them around Nell and Lyuu’s shoulders, and pulled them closer while placing my face right next to Lefi’s. It was the exact thing she’d done to me just a little bit earlier. Both the warwolf and the hero squeaked in surprise. The dragon, however, had a bit more sass to her.“One moment, you are a coward. The next, you are suddenly acting with bravado. How awfully suspicious,” said Lefi with a teasing grin. “Was the change driven by a sudden urge to be fawned upon?”
“Nah, not even close,” I laughed. “I just, you know, had a sudden thought.” I paused for a moment to smile, gently. “I really do love you. All of you.”The girls’ faces turned red. And not because they’d been in the bath for too long.“W-where’d this come from all of a sudden, Yuki?” asked Nell,
“I-I know, right? T-That was like a bolt right outta the blue. I’m real shocked right now, Master.”
“…I was not aware you were capable of delivering such a line,” said Lefi.I mean, you’re kinda right. I’m not, at least not normally. The only reason I’m saying it now is ‘cause of the mood. There wasn’t really much I could do about the mood of all things. Cuddling with the people I loved in a nice warm bath had basically set it in stone. Anyway, that’s enough rambling out of me. I’m pretty sure you already more than understand just how good I feel right now.I stopped thinking about happiness and allowed my mind to wander yet again. A sudden thought popped into my mind, so I allowed it to give itself voice.“…Where exactly did that potion come from anyway?” I wondered. ‘Cause that shit was weird. Both its effect and the way it wore off were super weird.Much to my surprise, the casual question I’d directed at no one in particular elicited a twitch. My eyes were immediately drawn to the reaction’s silver-haired source. “Wait a second…” My eyes narrowed. “Why so jumpy, Lefi? You got something to tell me?”
“I-I know not what you were talking about.”
“Talk. Now.” I said in a flat, unamused tone.
“I-I have very little of note to say. I simply believe that I may have a slight idea as to the potion’s origins.” Cold sweat dripped down the back of the dragon’s neck as she gave her schpiel. “I may or may not have recalled seeing it once,” she said, nervously. “But only after you consumed it.”
“Go on.”
“Do you remember the instance in which you attempted to investigate the possibility of crafting your own potions?”I recalled the exact experiment Lefi was talking about. I’d felt that potions were eating a bit too heavily into my budget, so I’d done a few quick experiments in order to determine whether or not I could craft my own. In the end, the idea had been a flop. All I was really able to figure out was that the mana they contained was of a different nature to the mana that most living things possessed.“Yeah, what about it?”
“The concept of crafting one’s own line of potions piqued my curiosity, so I took the opportunity to do precisely that whilst you remained away from your desk.” She laughed awkwardly as she did everything in her power to avoid my gaze. “I poured my magical energy into a bottle alongside a random assortment of materials. However, I soon grew bored and placed the bottle back amongst its peers without verifying the fruits of my intervention.”
“Wait. Weren’t you the one saying that everything I did today was entirely my fault?”
“I-I suppose I was,” she stuttered. “A-and I stand by the statement. While I was certainly was responsible for the potion’s synthesis, it was you who chose to drink it despite lacking knowledge of its effects.”
“Oh, you know what, I think you might be righ—NOT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MY FAULT? IT’S TOTALLY YOURS!”A series of panicked dragon sounds ensued as I shot to my feet and sent Lefi flying off my lap and headfirst into the water.“What was that for!?” she sputtered indignantly. “Your actions led me to consume an entire mouthful of bathwater!”
“Shut up! This whole goddamn thing is your fault!” I yelled back. “I had to spend a whole goddamn day as a kid because of your stupid bullshit!”
“And what is wrong with that!? Did you not eventually forget your concerns and begin enjoying yourself!?”
“Enjoying myself? Enjoying myself!?”
“Precisely! You were able to not only cope, but also adapt!”
“You think I was enjoying myself!? Naw, bitch! You crazy, fool! That shit was so bad I was finna shoot someone!”
“And now you are not only in denial but also adopting an infuriating manner of speech! This is precisely what I meant when I declared that you’ve once again become as far from adorable as one could possibly be!”Our argument was so intense that it didn’t leave much room for anyone to calm us down. Knowing that, Nell turned to Lyuu and made a suggestion. “…I think we should probably leave.”
“That’s a good idea, Nell. Stayin’ in the bath for too long ain’t all that good for you anyway,” said the warwolf.Meanwhile, I continued to shout. “In denial!? You’re the one in denial! You can call me uncute all you want, but you know what? I don’t fucking care! I never fucking wanted to be cute. You think anyone would want to be tiny and helpless like that? I couldn’t resist, no matter what you fucking did to me!”
“The childish charm that accompanied your form was all you had! Without it, you are but another irksome imbecile with a tongue as vulgar as a harlot!”The warwolf and hero laughed awkwardly at one another, stood up out of the water, and left the bathroom. But neither Lefi and I stopped. We continued to yell at each other and demonstrate that we were the very epitome of a loving couple.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: Fulfillment Only In Death
Editor(s): Joker, SpeedphoenixI know. I know that this is just a dream, a hallucination, a fabrication of the mind.Because he is already dead. Here, no one knows him. No one has ever met him—or even thought about him.And there, it’s no different. They’ve already stopped thinking about the impact he had on their everyday lives. Their activities no longer reminded them of him. Because they’ve already moved on.He doesn’t matter anymore.It’s like he never existed to begin with.But still, from time to time, I dream of him.Because I am his reflection.That’s why I will—can—not forget him.Because I am all that’s left to prove that he had lived.He was normal. Average. He had both parents, and just as many friends as anyone else. As he was still young, he had yet to amass much in the way of savings, but he never hurt for money. He had enough to get by.Elsewhere, people suffered. People around the world were subject to civil wars, international conflicts, terrorists, pandemics, and many other acts of unfairness outside their control. And each day, some would die. Unlike them, he was blessed enough not to know death. He never lived in fear of it. Nor had he ever considered courting it.Still, he felt his life was meaningless.I knew my life was meaningless.I didn’t know why I bothered going through all the motions. I didn’t feel like there was any point in existing. Or that my life held any value, intrinsic or otherwise.I existed.But that was it.I knew from the start that I was self-centred. That, as far as I was concerned, everything was about me.But that was why.That was exactly why it felt as if I was all alone in the world.My solitude was deep-seated.Ingrained.I knew that there were many other people out there.But it never really felt like I truly connected to them.I was all alone.The world itself was vast.But mine wasn’t.So little of it seemed to matter. The few parts that did were so bland that they may as well have been colourless, faded to nothing but shades of black and white.My days repeated themselves.It was the same seven-day cycle.Over and over.And I wanted out.But I didn’t know how I was supposed to escape. There was nothing I could do to struggle against the current. Not without goals, dreams, or aspirations. The world was too dry, too monochrome for me to recognize that there was hope to begin with.I always asked myself whether it was just me. Or if everyone else felt the same. Had all the others simply accepted that this was just what life was? And that they had no choice but to wade their way through it?I suspect so.But if that is truly the case, then this world is nothing if not cruel.That was how I felt.How he felt.It was with that thought, that mentality, that he greeted the reaper’s scythe.It was outside of his control.A stupid, unjustifiable accident outside his control.But it cut him short nonetheless.In the end, he amounted to nothing.Nothing but another insignificant pebble by the side of the road.***“…ki…uki…Yuki.”My cheek was enveloped by a gentle warmth, one that thawed my frozen mind and guided it back it from the abyss.Slowly, slowly, I opened my eyes.Lefi was there.She greeted me with a soothing, affectionate gaze, a caring smile so loving it was almost motherly. Her position atop my knees allowed her to keep one arm around my trunk as she used the other to slowly run her fingers through my hair.“Relax, Yuki. Relax,” she whispered into my ears. “I am right here. You need not be sad.” Her grip around my torso tightened as she used both arms to pull me into an embrace.
“H-Huh? W-what’s going on?” Awakening to the unexpected situation had me taken aback. I was so confused that I started to flub my words.
“So you have finally awakened?” Lefi loosened her arms and backed off just enough to look me in the face. “Well, uhm…” she paused for a moment, as if to find the right words. “How do you feel?”
“Same as usual, wh—” I moved my hands to my face in order to rub my eyes and clear up my vision, only to freeze as I touched my cheeks. They were moist. It was then that I realized that the nap I had taken atop the throne had left me stricken with tears. And that Lefi had been treating me with all the care she had because she’d caught onto the fact that I’d had a nightmare. Oof. That’s embarrassing.Realizing that she’d been comforting me in my sleep led me to cringe. It was a blow to my pride, and a serious one at that. I wasn’t a kid anymore. Crying because of some dumb dream was unacceptable.“…Sorry for making you worry,” I said, “But I’m fine. I’m probably just really tired or something.”
“Then you must take extra care to recuperate.” No additional prompting was needed for Lefi to catch onto and play along with my ruse. “It would not do for you to collapse from exhaustion, for the duty of hunting and procuring our meals would then fall to me.”
“Really? That’s what you’re worried about?”
“Naturally,” she chuckled. “Did you not consider that sustenance is of utmost importance?”She began to stand up and get off my lap. But I grabbed her by the wrist before she could.Her eyes opened wide.And so did mine.“What is it…?” She asked.
“Er, uh… I don’t know…” The action had been entirely involuntary. My body had moved on its own. So I had nothing to say. I ended up tripping over my own words, but in the end, I wasn’t able to come up with any sort of reasonable excuse.My fidgeting led Lefi to cast her surprise aside. She seemed to think up some sort of idea. Her face twisted into a smile as she sat back down and rested her back against my chest.“I must say, I am rather exhausted myself. Entertaining the children was quite the endeavour,” she said. “You are as functional a chair as any other. So as I am already here, I suppose I may as well take the opportunity to sit myself down for a moment of rest.”
“Well… have a seat then. No harm in a bit of rest, right?”
“Precisely. If you truly understand, then you would do best to sit still and play the part of a chair until I find myself satisfied.” She bent her head just enough to gaze up at me as she spoke.Knowing that she was right there by my side calmed me. Her presence was all it took for me to start fighting off my apparent sense of insecurity. It was a winning battle. But I felt as if victory still felt too far away, so I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her into a tight hug.Having her so close, basking in her warmth, was all the evidence I needed to know that I was really here. That I wasn’t just some random corpse kicked to the side of the road.“Thanks.”
“I see no reason why you should be thanking me,” she giggled.I knew. I knew that, ultimately speaking, my past life, his life, had amounted to nothing. He was so pathetic that he had even failed to do his duty as a living organism; he had failed to pass on his genes.But still, his life had meaning.In death.I didn’t know if he’d been reborn as a result of some sort of karma, or perhaps a bizarre stroke of luck. But whatever the case, he had failed at one more thing. He had failed to bring his story to a close.From death came life. And from life, fulfillment.Because the life that followed his rebirth was not the same as his first. Gone was the monochrome filter. His world had been filled with an incomparable amount of colour. So much that it left him appalled. The chore that was going through the motions of life had transformed, evolved, into something he anticipated. Every day he lived was one that would leave him hungering for the next.And that was what had allowed him to finally set a goal: to live by her side. Their sides.Everyone that lived here knew me, Yuki, the demon lord. But none knew him, the lonely soul who had spent even his final days in isolation.And they would never truly come to know him.That was why I resolved myself never to forget. Never to forget who—or why—he was. You know, maybe I should make him a grave. Just as an extra bit of material evidence.“Hey, Lefi?”
“What is it?”
“I know I never told you much about me. But I think I probably should,” I said, slowly. “The truth is, this isn’t my first life. I’ve already died, once.”
“You certainly have not told me any of the details,” she said. “I had always assumed that you merely never wished to speak of it. Why the sudden change of heart?”
“It’s just, you know, one of those things. I kinda happened to be in the mood is all.”
“Then I suppose I would love to listen,” she chuckled. “An opportunity as rare as this is not to be missed.”
“Hmmm… Alright. Now where do I start…? Oh, I know. How about I tell you a story about a little blue planet at the centre of the universe?”<– Prev — Next –>

Demon Lord from Another World

Survivor of Death’s Embrace
Demon Lord; King of the Dragons
Supreme Dragon’s SpouseDP: 100391Description
A demon lord and therefore a dungeon master. He has also become the King of the Dragons after slaying their previous monarch. The action has left the dragon’s village in a state of chaos, but Yuki neither knows nor cares. His stats are ridiculous, but as he had never been exposed to any sort of formal instruction, he lacks skill in the art of combat and often relies on brute force. He tends to have an easier time against enemies who share in his approach.Yuki is married to the Supreme Dragon and has also engaged both his maid and a hero in a relationship that can be described as one of a romantic nature. He plans to marry the maid in a year. His intentions with regards to the hero (redacted).He is a great help around the house. He can cook and clean as well as both look after and entertain children without any grievances or difficulty. He’s as handy as handymen get and enjoys DIY projects that inspire awe and passion in others. While the demon lord may appear to be the type to retort to the statements of others, he is in fact more often than not on the other end. That is, he leads others to make retorts, and is the reason that many of the retorts in question need to be made in the first place. He tends to enjoy himself most in the presence of others. When left to his own devices, he often runs out of ideas and gets bored.While first impressions may make Yuki seem like an organized, logical thinker, he is in fact a shameless scatterbrain. The combination of his bold nature and his haphazard mind often lead to him getting carried away as a result of one of his own mental tangents. He is therefore best kept under supervision.Leficios

Supreme Dragon
Demon Lord’s SpouseDescription
Leficios, the Supreme Dragon, often goes by the nickname Lefi. At a fundamental level, she is both vain and conceited. However, her recent experiences have shuffled her priorities and led to a gradual shift in her nature. She is married to the Demon Lord named Yuki. Her knowledge of his ditzy side and the surprisingly fragile nature of his psyche has led her to swear a silent oath declaring that she would forever remain by his side in order to offer emotional comfort and support whenever it is necessary.She gets along well with the dungeon’s other residents, and has even made a secret pact with Nell and Lyuu. The three have, without Yuki’s knowledge, sworn to aid each other in matters that concerned him.The immense power that accompanies her status as the Supreme Dragon makes it difficult for her to perform tasks that require little to no force. This led her to often fail at housework. Her failures frustrated her and led her to hate any sort of chore, but she has lately endeavoured to overcome this weakness nonetheless.Illuna

A young, blonde haired, blue eyed, beautiful vampire. She is home to the dungeon’s most innocent and contagious smile. Despite her young age, Illuna is incredibly intelligent and able to make sound decisions on the fly. She met the Lord of Spirits during the earlier years of her childhood, who both blessed her and taught her to manipulate his kin. He did not, however, reveal his identity, as such, she is not aware of it.Illuna’s best friend is Shii, the slime. The two often put their heads together and work out coordinated actions that they can perform together. With Enne thrown into the mix, their options have grown. They now find themselves looking to perform interesting acts of coordination that require three or more individuals.One of the vampire’s favorite foods is Yuki’s blood, which she enjoys roughly once a week. The act of drinking blood brings out the seductress in her despite her tender age. She has lately begun working on bolstering her femininity in secret, as is normal for a girl her age.Lyuuin Gyroll
Race: WarwolfDescriptionLyuuin Gyroll, commonly referred to as Lyuu, is a beastkin with shaggy brown hair and dog-like features in the form of ears and a tail. Though brought into the dungeon’s fold as a maid, she was completely useless at first. Nowadays, she’s become somewhat capable of doing her job; she still tends to fail if she allows her mind to wander.She’s the daughter of her people’s chief. Her father ended up in a dispute with Yuki after finding that she’d become his maid. As a result of the two men settling their differences, she became the demon lord’s fiancee. The two are set to wed in a year. Her affection for him is real, and she is more than willing to become his wife. However, she has been holding back on expressing her feelings because she doesn’t want to hurt Lefi’s. Her relationship with Yuki’s other lover, Nell, was rocky at first. Lyuu feared the other girl given her status as a hero. Now, however, the girls get along as well as two peas in a pod.Leila
Race: Sheep-horned DemonDescription
Leila has white hair, fair skin, and a pair of ram-like horns. As a maid, she is outstanding and capable of easily handling more than her fair share of work.She is kind, easy-going, and dependable. The combination of these traits have led her to effectively serve as the dungeon’s resident big sister. However, that is only one side to her. Leila houses a burning thirst for knowledge and streak for curiosity. Her interest in both dungeon and dungeon master ecology has led her to observe Yuki without his knowledge. She has filled three notebooks with data and reports, and is currently working on a fourth. Paper is considered an expensive luxury, and she is extremely grateful that living in the dungeon has provided her with liberal access to it.She thinks of Yuki in a much more favorable light than she does any ordinary man, but (redacted).Zaien
Race: Magic Weapon
Description
Zaien, or Enne, as she is colloquially known, is Yuki’s signature weapon. She bears the form of a crimson katana and specifically falls within the odachi subcategory given the extraneous size of her blade. She is extremely heavy and near impossible to wield lest one happens to possess strength on par with a demon lord. Her stats are on par with some legendary weapons. One can only imagine her final form, as she still has much room for growth.Enne is capable of producing a human-like avatar. In this form, she wears a set of clothes very much akin to a kimono. Even when personified, Enne is taciturn and only rarely openly expresses her emotions.The sword is willing to do just about anything for her master and sulks when he uses any other weapon.Nell
Race: Human
Class: HeroDescription
Nell is a hero affiliated with the Kingdom of Allysia. Her appearance often makes others mistake her for a tomboy when she is in fact much more of a girly girl at heart. Nell is good at housework, and has been tasked with helping Leila with meals.She fell in love with Yuki after he rescued her from the brink of death, and has now entered into a romantic relationship with him.Moving into the dungeon had been a drastic change for Nell. Her life there was so different from what it had been before that it had caused her to lose her bearings at first. She managed to adjust over time, and has come to enjoy the novelty that comes with the experience.Spending time with the dungeon and its overly laid-back residents has poisoned Nell’s mind; she is slowly growing more and more careless with each passing day.Dungeon-Affiliated MonstersShii
Race: Heal SlimeDescription
Yuki’s first monster. Shii has learned to warp her body and take on a human form. Though slimes are technically genderless, Shii is treated as a female, and everyone in the dungeon loves and dotes on her. As per her race, she is capable of healing magic. Her spells can only heal physical wounds, but the dungeon’s residents have come to the agreement that her mere presence is able to heal mental ones.Her best friend is Illuna, but she gets along with Lefi just as well given the dragon’s propensity to feed her mana.Shii is in the process of learning speechcraft. She still appears to have a bit of a lisp, but can be easily understood regardless. Speaking everyday has led to an evident improvement in her skill level over time, and she is sure to continue to grow and mature.Fluffrir
Race: Fenrir.Description
Fluffrir, or Rir as he is often referred to, is a monster in Yuki’s servitude. He belongs to a race of legendary creatures and is, at least by some standards, a literal god. The fluffiness of his fur evidences that he is likely deserving of this title.Rir is a commander. He is obeyed by both the other monsters Yuki has summoned and many of the Wicked Forest’s natives, who have sworn themselves to his servitude. Sadly, his position has done nothing to help his pessimistic nature. The many subordinates he has awaiting his orders has made every day a struggle, and his master’s unreasonable demands have not helped in the least. Still, Rir appreciates and even likes his master. The wolf has already grown accustomed to the demon lord’s propensity to become an undue cause of stress. His only notable grievance is that his master keeps calling him just to play with him and his fur.Rei, Rui, and Lowe
Race: WraithDescription
A trio of sisters under Yuki’s command, listed from oldest to youngest. All three are tomboyish in nature and enjoy playing pranks on others. This trait is especially evident in Lowe, who always takes things much further than the other two.As incorporeal beings, the wraiths are not able to touch or be touched by anything without possessing the dolls allotted to them by their master.Orochi

Race: Dark CrowDescription
A massive crow-like monster under Yuki’s command with obsidian feathers as dark and beautiful as the night.Yata specializes in making use of his viewpoint to seek out suitable foes and potential dangers. When working with the other three in his cohort, he serves as a scout, a lure, and a source of long-ranged damage.Byakku
Race: Demonic CatDescription
A two-tailed feline monster under Yuki’s command with sleek white fur.Byakku specializes in illusion magic. When working with the other three in her cohort, she serves as a source of crowd control. She uses her magic in order to deceive her enemies and provide her allies with an edge.Wsprit
Race: Water SpiritDescription
A translucent blue monster under Yuki’s command that looks very much like a bubbly lump of water. It has a somewhat similar appearance to Shii’s original form, but has much finer control over the manner in which it presents itself. It is even capable of splitting its body up into several pieces without incurring any damage. While a spirit in name, Wsprit is distinct from the spirits that Illuna is capable of calling.Wsprit specializes in support magic. When working with the other three in her cohort, she serves as a backline mage.Kingdom’s CitizensReiyd Glorio Allysia
Race: HumanDescription
Reyid is Allysia’s reigning monarch. Though mediocre and generally unaccomplished, Reiyd is thought of amicably by most of his people.He is busy putting out any remaining flames ignited by the conflict caused by his son’s brainwashing and uprising. Much to his chagrin, he is so busy that he even continues to work in his dreams. Adjectives that accurately describe him in his current state include: overworked, anxious, and stressed.His daughter has recently grown to the point where she has started discussing her taste in men with him. These conversations have left him feeling more conflicted than anything else.Iryll Glorio Allysia
Race: HumanDescription
The king’s only daughter. Iryll was saved by Yuki whilst in the middle of being abused by the sexual deviant responsible for keeping watch over her and her father. She has thought of him as her hero and longed for him ever since.Raylow Lurubia

Raylow is Alfyro’s governor. He has come to be one of the king’s most trusted following his many accomplishments following the prince’s attempted uprising. He has recently been put in charge of managing the territories owned by many a treasonous, recently-executed governor. The rate at which his hairline has been receding has been increasing proportionally to the weight of his responsibilities. He is an unfortunate soul, but there is little that can be done for him. One can only pray that his circumstances may one day change for the better.Gamdia Roston
Race: HumanDescription
Gamdia is the commander of the order of knights in charge of maintaining Alfyro’s security. He was once a part of the team set on invading the Wicked Forest, but fled following the warning he received from Yuki. The incident hurt his reputation and left him without a job, but he wasn’t left in dire straights for long. He soon caught the attention of Raylow, who offered him his current position.Alfyro’s proximity to the Wicked Forest and distance from the capital in general has led it to be filled with ruffians. And yet, Gamdia is shown respect nonetheless; he is extremely powerful for a human being. This, combined with his reliable nature, has made him Raylow’s right-hand man.Gamdia’s life has been filled with many ups and downs, but he’s satisfied with where it’s led him.Carlotta De Maya
Race: HumanDescription
Carlotta is Nell’s boss and the commander of the Order of the Faldien Holy Knights, whose operations are based in Allysia’s capital, Alshir. As a commander, she is an exception amongst exceptions. She is strong-willed, beautiful, and contrary to what one would normally expect of an individual in her position, not very risk averse; her decisions and actions are bold, daring, and unconservative.Opting to take the king’s side during the conflict has left the church, and Carlotta in particular, with a distressing amount of work. But rather than wiping the smile off the holy knight’s face, the workload has only served to broaden it. As a workaholic, Carlotta is happily chewing her way through everything sent her way.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Return — Part 1
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerI was situated on the throne with my feet kicked up and my arms behind my head. I had just returned from hunting. The raid I’d conducted with Lefi had addressed my immediate financial concerns, but I still didn’t have quite enough DP for me to feel at ease, so I’d turned the blood sport into one of my day to day chores. And now that I was done, I could finally kick back.My mind began to drift off as I relaxed, as it often did once I got home. I was looking forward to dinner. I knew that the girls would live up to my expectations and deliver something far beyond just edible.The moment I started fantasizing about all the good eats I was sure soon to enjoy was the moment I felt someone lightly tap me on the shoulder.“Hey, Yuki?” It was the hero.
“Whaddya want?” I grunted as I sat back up.
“I want to go back to the kingdom for a bit,” she said. “I know we already went once to send that letter, but I still think I should probably head back to the capital and speak to everyone in person.”
“Huh…” I took a moment to consider the amount of time she’d spent amongst the dungeon’s residents. “Oh wow, I almost didn’t realize you’ve already been here for over a month.”And here I was thinking that I’d only just tempted this young, impressionable hero over to the dark side.There was a fairly strong argument to be made for the point Nell had brought up. The two of us had indeed visited the city with the old, rapidly balding governor in order to send a letter and tell everyone that Nell was still alive and kicking. But that, in and of itself, wasn’t anywhere near good enough to confirm that she was really doing as well as she said she was.I saw no issue with letting her visit. But that didn’t mean I was going to let her go. She was mine now. I had no intention of handing her over to the kingdom even if they insisted that she stay. I knew that some of its brass probably would. Because heroes were more than just the gamified protagonists I thought of them as. They were weapons. And they were handled appropriately. Most treated them more like nukes than people.On Earth, the term “one man army” was an exaggeration, an impossible fabrication invented only to glorify the skilled and lucky. But here, it was a reality. Nell was quite literally capable of turning the tides of war simply by charging in headfirst. She was more valuable than even the most renowned officers; I suspected that they were probably going to put together a squad to look for her soon if they hadn’t already. And it’s probably time for me to clear a few things up as well. I can’t just play the part of the indecisive protagonist forever now, can I?“Yeah, I guess it’s about time,” I said. “In that case, what do you say we head out tomorrow?”
“Oh, uhm… Sorry if I made it seem like I was trying to get you to come with me. You don’t really have to if you don’t want to,” she said.
“Don’t sweat it,” I said with a shrug. “I was planning on tagging along anyway. I figure I probably need to be there anyway in order to tie up a few loose ends. I was kind of planning on keeping you, but I know it’s more complicated than just straight up saying you’re mine now or whatever since you’re a hero and whatnot, so I was going to go talk to some of the people you normally associate and sort out their concerns.”
“D-does that mean we’re going on a trip together?” She stammered in a happy but embarrassed tone.
“Yes, Captain Obvious. It does,” I said with a grin.
“I can’t wait.” She smiled at me, but twisted her lips into a frown as she seemed to recall something. “But let’s not take the Rir Express this time. ”
“What? Why not? I like taking the Rir Express,” I grumbled.
“Because we’re not in a rush. And I don’t,” she stated.Aw, man… And here I was looking forward to riding like the wind.***And so, the next day went exactly as planned. We bid the dungeon’s other residents our farewells, hopped on Rir, and went for a slow, leisurely ride through the forest, one on which we found ourselves accompanied by the fearsome foursome. Rir was having them help make our trip more relaxing. He barked the occasional order at them and had them exterminate anything brave enough to approach our convoy.The snake, the crow, the cat, and the spirit had all grown considerably. They’d leveled all the way from 1 to 83, 72, 79, and 71 respectively. Generally speaking, they were all growing at the same rate, and their stats generally fell in the same range, with each individual having different strengths and weaknesses based on the particulars of their kit. As the party’s primary damage dealer, Orochi was always in the thick of the fight. And as such, his level had naturally ended up a bit higher than everyone else’s.I had high hopes for all four of my newest summons. It looked like they were going to keep hunting, growing, and making my life easier as they matured. Best retirement plan ever.“Rir sure is soft and fluffy.” The girl situated in front of me offered the wolf a few pats on the head as she hummed.
“Of course he is,” I replied. “He’s the fluffiest thing that this world has to offer.”
“If you say so.” Nell giggled as she turned away from me and looked in the direction in which our destination supposedly lay.As I watched her, I had a sudden thought. Nell’s duty had turned her into a tomboy, but she was undoubtedly still the closest thing the dungeon had to an individual who embodied the concept of a maiden. As someone who had undergone a strict, religious education, all of Nell’s actions seemed to carry a hint of grace to them. She had started to slip a bit as of late as a result of our influence, but at the core, she remained relatively elegant regardless. Moreover, she was one of the most bashful individuals around, and definitely had the girliest interests of all of my family’s members.“Oh yeah, I know this is a bit of a random side note, but there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.” Thinking about the way she carried herself prompted me to ask her a question. “I know they taught you how to fight and shit, but did they teach you manners and stuff too? Or was that not a part of the standard hero curriculum?”
“It was,” she laughed, dryly. “I know I don’t make heroes seem all that important, but we are. We have to meet with kings and other high ranking nobles all the time, so one of the first things we’re taught is how we’re supposed to behave in high society.”
“Ew. Honestly, all that sounds like to me is a huge pain in the ass.”
“That’s exactly what it was.” Her eyes glazed as they directed themselves towards the past. “Thinking back, that was probably the toughest part of my training. Much tougher than learning how to use a sword. Do you know how many different ways there are to bow? And all the different situations they’re used in?” Her words were heavy, laden with layers upon layers of suffering and despair. “Because I do. I memorized each and every single one. I memorized how I was supposed to bow, how I was supposed to walk, and how I was supposed to eat. I memorized all of it. All of it…”
“Right…”
“I wonder how all my friends are doing…” After a brief moment of silence, the short-haired brunette snapped out of her trance and quickly changed the topic. “Or if the letters we sent ever ended up reaching their destinations.”
“Probably. It’s been a good while since we sent them.” I chuckled nervously as I entertained the thought.Like the hero, I too had written a letter, specifically one addressed to the Allysian princess. It had been bundled alongside the letter that Nell had used to tell her superiors that she was still safe, so I had few doubts as to whether it had reached its destination. The letter’s contents had been fairly bland and generic. When writing to me, the princess had mentioned that she wished to see me even if it meant running away from home, so I’d tried my best to pacify any potentially problematic behaviour by telling her to think more of her father’s feelings on the matter. Yeah, Iunno about you, but I’m worried for her. Hopefully she doesn’t get too crazy. And hopefully visiting the capital will be enough to keep her sated and pacified for the time being. Hopefully.“Oh, come on Yuki.” The less than thrilled tone I spoke with led Nell to frown at me. “It’s your fault the princess is so attached to you,” she said in a scolding tone. “You really need to stop saving every girl you come across if you want them to stop falling for you.”
“It’s not my fault it keeps happening,” I groaned.
“Yes it is. Why else do you think Lefi keeps saying that you’re just going around seducing every girl you come across?”
“Yeah, like I said. Not my fault.”
“Mhmm…” She smiled teasingly. Nell wasn’t all that used to smug grins, so the expression she wore looked much more like a genuine smile than it did anything else.
“What was that supposed to mean?”
“It was supposed to mean that it’s totally your fault that every single girl you save ends up falling in love with you.”Only after speaking did she finally stop to think about her words. There was an awkward moment of silence. Her face slowly reddened as she lowered her gaze in order to hide her embarrassment.“You know, Nell, if there’s one thing you’re really good at, it’s blurting out random embarrassing comments.” It wasn’t the first, nor even the second time the hero had voiced such a line before considering its implications.“…I didn’t realize it was going to be that embarrassing until I said it,” she mumbled. “And now I’m starting to blush. This is all your fault. I never would have said anything like that if you weren’t rubbing off on me so much.”
“What do you mean, my fault? Since when have I ever said anything that embarrassing?”
“You do it all the time! I can’t even count the number of times you’ve made me turn red as a tomato anymore,” she said. “But uhm… that’s one of the things that I really love about you.”
“…I see. Uhh… Thanks, I guess…”
“…Mhm.”
“…”
“…”Well… This is awkward.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Return — Part 2
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“Looks like the city’s coming up on the horizon.” I pointed at Alfyro the moment I spotted it. While the Rir Express would have allowed us to reach the city in about two hours, the Rir Not-So-Express had caused the trip to take a whole six— not that that was a bad thing. Our business wasn’t anywhere near urgent enough to warrant a mad dash for the capital, and the leisurely, uneventful journey had served as an opportunity for us to kick back and relax.Alfyro was smack in the middle of nowhere. The Wicked Forest, an area that few wished to explore, was the only major landmark in its vicinity. And yet, it was bustling with life. There was even a queue outside its gates. So many people wished to enter it that the line never seemed to fade even with it moving at a fairly rapid pace.After finding ourselves a nice, bushy patch of trees to keep us out of sight, we dismounted. I jumped off Rir and offered Nell a hand. This was our stop. I wasn’t planning on riding the legendary wolf all the way to the capital. There was no reason to risk blowing our cover. I wasn’t in a rush to stop some sort of sinister plot. Nor did I need to put down a douchey prince. It was the perfect chance to act as a human would and laze around and enjoy the scenery atop an old horse-drawn wagon as it bumped its way down an unpaved dirt road.“Thanks Rir.” I ruffled my pet’s fur. “Don’t worry about waiting around for us. I’ve got no clue how long we’re going to be gone this time,” I said. “We’ve got other ways to get back home anyway.”I was, of course, talking about the wonderful necklace-like device capable of teleporting me straight to my core. I was planning on making liberal use of it and warping us back once we were done with our business.“Make sure you keep everyone safe while I’m out,” I said. “But don’t push yourself too hard. Make sure you bug Lefi if you ever end up finding yourself in a rough spot. She should be able to bail you out of just about anything.” After fluffing up the fur on his head one last time, I took a step back and looked at both him and the four lined up behind him. “Thanks Rir. And you guys too.”All five monsters made a cry of acknowledgement and bowed their heads.I knew that they would continue to serve me well, so I nodded, turned towards the city, and set out for its front gate with Nell in tow.***The line moved as smooth as silk. The soldiers responsible for screening the city’s visitors rarely stopped much in the way of anyone. And when they did, it was quick. They would look through their paperwork, ask a question or two, and allow them to enter.At least until it was our turn.“Good morning, and welcome to Alfyr—wait a second. I’ve seen you before.” One of the guards, an older man, stopped us before we stepped through the gates. His brow was raised in suspicious recognition; he had clearly made me.Hmm… He does look kinda familiar.…“Wait, were you the same angry old guy I ran into last time I had to go through this gate?”
“I am. And I see you’ve yet to learn any manners,” he crossed his arms and huffed in mock indignance before breaking into a friendly smile. “It’s been a few months since I’ve seen you around. How’s life been treating you?”
“Same as usual.” I shrugged. “Man, how the hell did you instantly make me? I didn’t even realize I knew you ‘till you made it obvious that you knew me.”
“My memory’s one of my strengths. It’s why they’ve got me assigned to the gate,” he laughed, heartily.I opened my mouth to call him on his bluff, but stopped midway and settled for laughing along instead. He wasn’t kidding, nor even bragging. He wouldn’t have been able to recognize me if he wasn’t telling the truth. Wow. I’m actually pretty impressed.“I see you’ve got Ms. Holy Knight with you again today. Where’s the other girl? I could’ve sworn that there was a brat with silver hair with you last time, one that was every bit as rude as you were.”Alright, I was impressed before, but now he’s got me blown outta the water. Shit dude, he’s 3 for 3. He even remembers Lefi. And she’s not even here.“Damn, man, you really do have a good memory,” I remarked. “She didn’t come with us ‘cause she doesn’t really have any business in town today. Right, Ms. Holy Knight?” I turned to Nell in order to have her reaffirm the statement.
“Huh? Oh, uhm, yeah.” She nodded, half-panicked, before talking to herself under her breath, “I almost forgot I was supposed to be with the church. And that I was a knight… I didn’t even realize they were talking about me.”I feel like I miiiight’ve just heard something I wasn’t supposed to. But you know what, whatever. I’mma just ignore it and move on.“So, gonna let us through?” I turned back towards the old gatekeeper. “I’ve even actually got papers this time.” I flashed the card I obtained from the Adventurers’ Guild.
“Oh, well would you look at that, you can learn!” He chuckled. “Well, if you’ve got papers, then I guess I don’t really have much of a choice. Go on through and enjoy your stay.” He didn’t bother giving the card any more than a glance before using a hand to gesture at the gate behind him.
“Will do. See ya.”With the guard out of our way, I had assumed that we were going to be able to go about our business without any further interruptions. I was wrong. A second dose of trouble greeted us the second we stepped into town.I noticed an odd, clanking sound. Turning my gaze on the source of the metallic grinding once again led me to lay eyes on a soldier with a familiar face. Like the first, he was old. But one could tell at a glance he was much more seasoned. Though I didn’t remember his name, I had immediately recognized him as one of the commanders that had led the Wicked Forest’s invasion, and the only one to have lived.For a moment, he stared at us in shock. He had frozen in place with one foot out the door; half of him was still stuck inside the gate-side guard station.“W-what are you two doing here!?” He broke into a run and dashed right at us as he recovered. For some reason beyond my comprehension, the look on his face almost seemed frantic in nature.Huh. Weird.“Long time no see, old dude number two,” I said with a casual wave.
“I wasn’t aware that you were so well associated with Lady Nell, Dem—sir.”
“Yeah, well I am. What’s up?”
“…I know that you likely have plans already.” He took a deep breath. “But please allow me to interrupt them and escort you to the governor’s manor. It’s of utmost importance that you see him immediately.”
“Has something happened?”The hero’s question led the man to grimace.“The capital’s descended into a state of chaos. It’s even worse now than it was when you set off for the demon realm,” he groaned. “And to make matters worse, even you’ve become a topic of much debate.”
“I have?” Nell blinked a few times in surprise.
“You have,” he nodded, gravely. “And not for any reason you might enjoy. I can’t explain it nearly as well as the governor. You might as well hear it from him instead. Would you mind?”
“I don’t, but do you?” She turned to me.
“Why would I?” I shrugged. “If it’s your business, then we’re probably going to have to end up addressing it eventually anyway, so might as well.”
“Thanks Yuki. Then uhm, Mister… Roston, was it? Please lead the way.”
“Right away, ma’am. And thank you very much for complying.”And that was how I ended up visiting Alfyro’s governor a third time.***“Nell!? And the Demon Lord!? What are the two of you doing here!?” The first thing the governor did as we entered his office was react the same way as his subordinate.The man, whose name I vaguely recalled to be Raylow, was buried in paperwork. Literally. His desk had so many sheets stacked on top of it that I could barely see him. The few glimpses I did catch informed me that he was even more tired than he was the last time I saw him. His hairline had receded far too significantly for comfort, and his eyebags were so prominent I began suspecting that he was part panda. Though he held the resources to live a life of luxury, he was clearly just as, if not even more tired than some of Japan’s most exhausted corporate slaves. Just looking at him was enough to make me cringe in a mix of discomfort and pity.“Hey man, I uhh… know you’ve probably been a bit too busy to take care of yourself lately, so here. Take this.” I grabbed one of the usual potions from my inventory and handed it to him.
“And what would this be?” He accepted the gift, albeit with a look of suspicion.
“It’s basically just a vitamin supplement. It’ll probably make you feel a good bit better, so make sure you down it if you ever feel the urge to collapse.”I suspected that the potion was going to end up being a little bit more effective than he was expecting it to be. I could already see him literally bursting with vigour the moment it flooded his system with its highly potent mana. But if anything, that’s a good thing. He kinda needs it.“Thank you.” He said, tiredly. “I suppose the many sleepless nights I’ve enjoyed over the course of the last month have finally caught up with me.” A self-mocking smile appeared on his face. “I never would have expected to appear so exhausted that even you would be willing to take steps to better my health, Demon Lord.” His smile faded as quickly as it’d come and found itself replaced by a frown. “Now, I understand why Miss Hero over there happens to be present, but why have you come? Is it more business?”
“Nah. I’m just here because she is.”
“I don’t quite seem to follow.”
“Oh. Right, I forgot to explain. We’re getting hitched.”
“Excuse me?” He raised a brow as he leant forward as if to better hear my voice. “The two of you… are doing what…?”
“Getting hitched, married, whatever you want to call it,” I said in a matter-of-fact tone. “I’m sure you can already see the problem, with her being a hero and whatnot.” I shrugged. “Anyway, she was planning to see her superiors and shit in order to figure some stuff out, so I figured that I might as well tag along so I can claim her and then get any of the trouble that comes out of it sorted out.”Raylow covered his face with one of his hands. He used his thumb to massage one temple, and his middle finger to do the same to the other.“A demon lord is wedding a hero? I… don’t understand. Are you serious?” Upon lowering his hand, he turned to Nell for confirmation.
“M-mhm…” Her cheeks flushed as she bashfully nodded.The action was both incredibly cute and entirely natural. Oh Nell, you cunning little vixen, you. Stop trying to win my heart over. I mean, I’m not going to say I won’t forgive you. You’re far too cute for me to really want to hold a grudge. But still. Knock it off, you sly fox, you.“…” After taking a moment to process her response, Raylow sighed. “I have a whole plethora to say with regards to the sheer absurdity of this situation, but I’m going to be refraining from commenting for the sake of my own sanity.” Again, Raylow sighed. “I heard nothing and your relationship is absolutely not any of my business. Do as you wish.”
“That was the plan,” I said with a smirk.
“Though, I suppose that this means the topic I wanted to discuss with her very well may now involve you as well.” Raylow didn’t even bother verbally acknowledging the snarky comment. He simply ignored it and moved on. “Why don’t we get down to business?”
“Were you planning to speak to me about everything that happened while I was away?” asked Nell, timidly.
“I was.” After taking a moment to breathe, the old governor began to describe the current state of the Allysian Kingdom.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Return — Part 3
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerThe wooden, horse-drawn carriage rattled as it slowly made its way down a well-trodden dirt path. Upon sticking my head out the window, I found us surrounded by a seemingly endless field of green. Untamed, waist high grass extended as far as the eye could see in every which way. Wave-like patterns spread through the emerald sea as it fluttered to and fro in the wind. It was, in all fairness, a beautiful sight. One I couldn’t enjoy. There had been nothing but green for hours, and I was sick of it. We were the only thing that stood out from the backdrop. The armed men surrounding our wagon, visible from a mile away, were second in conspicuity only to the vehicles they guarded. Distinct as they were, the men were effectively the same as the environment. They offered nothing of interest to gaze upon. The same went for the carriage in the front of us, the only other member of our convoy. It was too bland to entertain me.With a sigh, I repositioned myself back inside the coach and looked at the girl I shared it with. Her usual energy was nowhere to be seen. Brooding had led the light that normally filled her eyes to be replaced by a dark melancholy, one only emphasized by the rigid frown that accompanied her furrowed brows. The way she lifelessly leaned against the side of the carriage with her face propped up by a wrist was so depressing it was lovely. I know this is really inappropriate, but I really wish I could snap a few pictures of her right about now. This’d definitely be one for a museum or archive somewhere.Calling the situation at hand complicated was practically an understatement. Both she and the kingdom were involved in far more turmoil than was necessary by any means. And it had all stemmed from the “prince’s” revolt, the conflict that I had joined and at least in part resolved. My intervention had brought the armed revolution to a close. The prince’s supporters had been purged en masse. They were captured, convicted of high treason, and sentenced to the guillotine. Their heads quite literally flew by the dozen. And that was precisely why the kingdom’s political climate had failed to recover.Removing the prince’s allies had left as many empty government positions as it had headless carcasses. Allysia naturally compensated for its loss by finding new government officials. But most of its new hires were still green. Their lack of experience prevented them from getting much done. In the end, it had fallen to the king to take up the mantle. He had single-handedly shredded mountains upon mountains of administrative work and saved his kingdom from collapse. But there was only so much that one man could do. He had no choice to split his focus between internal affairs and foreign relations in the case that other sovereign entities chose to interfere in his business. It was a well-made choice. Because interfere they did.As a major human power, Allysia had no shortage of enemies. Countries both near and far stuck their noses in its business. They attacked the kingdom both directly and indirectly. The direct attacks took the form of skirmishes. Small armed forces stemming from foreign nations would alternate between executing non-committal attacks and conducting military exercises along the border in order to force Allysia’s already strained executives to pay them heed. And that was on top of harassing Allysian traders and causing a whole plethora of other minor issues that begged the brass’ attention. The king and his men were able to leverage their nation’s extensive might to quell every issue that arose. But that wasn’t to say that the kingdom was unaffected.With that said, the most significant foreign power-centric problems stemmed not from any blatant military or economic action, but rather, espionage. Foreign surveillance agents were only made more effective by the kingdom’s restaffing efforts. Its new hires were leaking as much information as they were made privy to. Some were bad actors. They willingly traded treason for treasure. Others were simply less than competent. They were far too green to keep secrets and often allowed themselves to divulge details pertaining to their work.Raylow, the man whose carriage made up the other half of our caravan, had only lost as much sleep as he had due to the frequency with which he needed to travel between the capital and his home. He was, in effect, running around as frantically as a headless chicken in order to get everything under control. There were an endless number of things for him to do in spite of the sudden drop in the number of political rivals he had to face.The king’s faction wasn’t the only group involved in the country’s restoration. As a major contributor to the monarch’s salvation, the church had also taken it upon itself to calm the masses and bring order to the kingdom. That was simply its natural duty—any religious organization’s natural duty.People were known to flock to faith in times of hardship. High crime rates and low standards of living were two of religion’s most powerful proponents. Hope was what allowed the people to surmount the grief that inevitably came with a medieval understanding of the medical sciences. There was death around every corner. Famines were commonplace. Many diseases, wounds, and infections remained effectively untreatable. That was why. That was why believing that there was something beyond their morbid, bland lives allowed them to carry on. The promise of relief, the trust that a greater authority would one day bring them salvation, be it in this life or the next, was one of the few things that prevented the populace from succumbing to despair.For Allysia’s people—and all of humanity—that greater authority was the church. And the hero that served as its symbol. Nell.They worshipped her. They were indoctrinated in their early childhoods and conditioned to believe that she was their saviour, the shepherd that would guide them into the light. The fact that she lived in Allysia had only made the people even more reliant on her presence. To them, she was equivalent to their peace of mind.That was why many saw her untimely expedition to the demon realm as a sign, as evidence that the kingdom’s sole guardian was failing to do her duty. They failed to comprehend that parading around the country was by no means necessarily the hero’s best course of action.It wasn’t entirely their fault. Most of the country’s population remained uneducated. And few were capable of truly understanding a concept as abstract as a long term investment. The church’s silence didn’t help, but they had no choice. The expedition was a top-secret mission that could be compromised by the tiniest of leaks. As straight lies were unsustainable, they had chosen to describe her as being locked in the midst of battle for the sake of their God and his people. It was an excellent decision, one that could—and would—have quelled all but a few unsettled souls.But then, Nell vanished. In more than just the eyes of the citizens. The month she’d spent in the dungeon was one in which she stayed off the radar. The one and only letter she’d sent failed to suffice as a report. It described that she was safe, but failed to explain where she had gone or why. As there had been no follow up reports, it was impossible for management to discern whether the first had been forged, written under coercion, or otherwise untruthful. To her coworkers, superiors, and other associates, she was effectively missing in action. And that unsettled them. Significantly. It was like the country’s one and only nuke had suddenly upped and vanished.Under normal circumstances, it wouldn’t be all that strange for her to lose contact. Unlike a nuke, she didn’t sit in a silo all day. She had a job, and a dangerous one at that. Staying in touch was a luxury she often couldn’t afford. That was why all would have been fine had the precise circumstances not been what they were.The source of all Nell’s misfortune was a government employee, a still incompetent new hire that had accidentally revealed that contact with her had been lost, and that her whereabouts remained unknown. Providing this knowledge to the public had led chaos to breed. It came to be known that this was not the first, but the second time that the hero had suddenly vanished without a word.Allysia’s people soon began calling her abilities to question. And frankly, though their allegations were false, they were, in a way, justified. Unlike me, the average Joe wasn’t privy to the fact that Nell had far more potential than every other human on the planet. They weren’t able to see her numbers, let alone the rate at which they had grown. But even if they could, little, if anything, would change. Because numbers meant nothing to them. They didn’t understand what values were supposed to be. Nor would they have the cognitive ability to grasp the intricacies and implications of existing at one of the normal distribution’s furthest ends. In the general public’s eyes, Nell was only worth as much as the achievements she had yet to accrue. Some had even started a movement that called for her to be removed from her post and replaced.Ultimately speaking, the situation at hand was more or less my fault. It was all because of the fact that I’d chosen to keep her locked up in the dungeon for too long. Twice.What does that mean to me? I raised my eyes to meet hers as I evaluated my thoughts on the matter. I only went with this stupid ass harem idea at first because Lefi was basically making me. But you know, what? Nell’s grown on me. A lot.I was confident in saying that I had no intention of letting her slip out of my grasp. I wanted her to keep living with us. And I was very tempted to simply have my way and be done with it. But I knew that things were a little too complicated for me to simply make a declaration and call it a day. Nell had deep connections with the humans. And her connections left her with a heavy burden she likely felt obligated to bear.“Hey, Nell?”
“Yeah?” She slowly raised her head and looked at me.I didn’t actually have my thoughts sorted enough to form them into words just yet, so I picked her up and plopped her down in my lap to buy a few moments of time. And as I did, I indulged in her warmth, in the comfort that was Nell.“Y-Yuki!? W-what are you doing?” She reacted with a start.
“Nothing. Just appreciating how soft and warm you are.”
“W-w-w-where did that come from!?”
“Touching you, duh,” I laughed, then paused just long enough for the mood to turn solemn. “So? You sort your feelings out yet?”
“My feelings? You mean about being a hero?”
“More or less, yeah.”
I was met with silence as she pursed her lips in indecisive lament.
“You see, Nell. I—we—already think of you as one of us. Everyone in the dungeon loves you, and we’d like you to stay. But we know that you’ve still got your duties. You’re a hero. Unlike us, you can’t just laze around in a castle all day. You’ve got things to do.”
“…Mhm.”
“Why did you end up choosing to go through with this whole hero thing anyway?”She spent a few moments hesitating. Her mouth opened and closed, and opened and closed.“I… I wanted to help.” She eventually managed to squeeze the words out, slowly, painfully. “I wanted to help the people. And my mom. She raised me all by herself. Her life was hard. I wanted to make it easier.”
“I see…”
“Being a real hero is all I used to want. But not anymore. Now, I want to be with you more than I want to be a hero. And I hate myself for it. I hate myself for being so indecisive. But I’d hate myself even more if I were to just give up and abandon my duty.” Her voice started to crack as she choked back her tears. “Why do I have to be so half-baked? I can’t ever do anything right. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m supposed to fix, or how.” The dam holding back her emotions broke. Soggy, sad droplets burst from the cracks and flowed down her cheeks. “I don’t know what to do with myself anymore…”The hero, the woman, buried her face into my shoulders and wept. I knew that nothing I said would truly make her woes go away, so I simply ran my fingers through her hair over and over as she continued to cry.<– Prev — Next –>

Rest Stop — Part 1
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerGlorified stone busts and expensive paintings lined the wall of the noble’s manor. Everything from the floor to the furniture to the chandelier-laden ceiling served as a blatant demonstration of the owner’s excessive wealth. The mansion wasn’t the only thing dressed to the nines. Both its owner and his guests had also equipped themselves with their finest attire—as was the norm when one was attending an event hosted only for members of high society.The party’s many invitees drank fine wine, conversed, and probed one another with insincere smiles plastered all over their faces. The impressive, silken gowns had done nothing to correct their devious natures. One especially sinister group was comprised of three men. They spoke in hushed voices and stood close to ensure that their conversation would not be overheard. They even maintained casual expressions such that their conversation could be passed off as mere small talk by any potential observers.“Are you sure?” A man with a thick beard lowered his wine glass as he looked towards one of his co-conspirators.
“I am.” The reply was spoken by a gentlemanly aristocrat with a smile as sly as a fox’s. “One of my subordinates has just sent word and informed me that he spotted her in Alfyro. She’s boarded a carriage bound for the capital, and is likely to arrive shortly.”
“Alfyro? Hah! How fitting.” The group’s third member, a man significantly wider than the other two, humphed in disapproval. “The lowly upstart that rules that miserable one-horse town is the king’s newest lapdog. Both he and that godforsaken church feel the need to support the old fool’s reign. We should have known. The incompetent governor and the useless ‘hero’ certainly do make for quite the unsightly pair.” His lips twisted as he made a suggestive smile. “Sometimes I wish we’d be fortunate enough for the two to simply disappear.”
“Well, my dear friend,” the fox-like man returned the smile with one of his own, “I suppose you’d be rather pleased to learn that I’ve already taken… precautions to ensure that we will soon find ourselves missing an eyesore.”
“Why, that sounds wonderful,” chuckled the fat man. “I suppose this has something to do with the accomplice you acquired the other day?”
“Accomplice is a strong word. We’d much rather be called kindred spirits. You see, we both happen to be true patriots dissatisfied with the current state of the nation.”
“Any patriot chauvinistic enough to answer capitalism’s call to action is a true reliable patriot indeed.” The bearded man chuckled. “But are you sure that the information he’s feeding you is of value? Most of the clergymen who support us are, unfortunately, not exactly the most knowledgeable or influential.”
“Oh, don’t you worry about that. When I stated that he was a kindred spirit, I meant it. Like me, he works under an individual with widespread influence.”
“I am glad to hear that,” said the bearded man. “And I apologize if my doubt came off as rude.”
“No, no, not at all. You were right to consider the unfortunate possibility. Not all of our allies have been fortunate enough to be in positions of power.”The bearded and fox-like men shared a hearty laugh, while the fatter man took a sip of his wine.“I am glad to see you so proactive, but I must remind you to stay on your toes. The hero still has many allies, and they are sure to flock to her the moment she returns.”
“Not to worry,” said the fox with an understanding nod. “I’ve already put one of my plans into action. Returning to the capital will do little more than tighten the noose we’ve trussed around her neck. She will be undone.”***“Damn, this place is fancy.” I wolf whistled the moment I stepped into the inn.“Still a whole order of magnitude worse than the castle, but it’s more than good enough for me to see why the old governor mentioned that it’s basically the noble go-to.”It really was fancy with a capital F. Every part of the setup screamed that it was meant for none other than the rich and famous. The halls were gaudy and made especially thick to feature an extra helping of security on top of the layer that its guards already offered. Even the drop-off zone screamed safety first. It featured four walls, a large set of double-doors, and a handsome roof. It even connected directly to the inn’s interior in order to ensure its guests would be able to remain anonymous and keep themselves from the public eye if need be.“Yuki, I know that your castle is really well decorated, but was it really necessary for you to bring it up just to brag?” asked Nell with a sigh.
“Oh, hey, almost wasn’t expecting you to comment,” I said. “You finally feeling better?”
“M-Mhmm…” She nodded shyly as she kept her eyes pointed towards the ground. “I think I’m okay now. Really embarrassed, but definitely okay.”Her cheeks were tinged a light shade of pink, and not because they’d been stained with tears. Rather, their newfound shade was the result of being made aware of the fact that she had spent most of the trip asleep in my arms after crying herself to the brink of exhaustion. Throwing a fit and venting her emotions had been good for her. It had allowed her to sort out her thoughts and regain her cool.Likewise, I also found myself much less concerned; I was happy to see that her smile had returned.Our little carriage ride had spanned the whole day. The sun had already set, and the moon had already taken its place. We would have long reached the capital had we ridden Rir, but such a feat was far too tall an order for our horses. Not even top of the line race horses could keep up with him, let alone the poor draft horses we had strapped our carriages to. As such, we had settled for spending the night in a city that was about halfway between our point of departure and our destination.The inn we were checking ourselves into was one that the old governor frequented. Errr, I guess it’s more like his men are checking us in and we’re just standing around until they’re done all the paperwork, but whatever. Point is, we’re waiting around for our keys.Travelling back and forth between his domain and the capital was an act that the balding man was often forced to engage in. And today’s trip was no exception. He had only accompanied us because he had no choice but to resolve himself to do everything within his power to mitigate the chaos that was sure to accompany the hero’s return. His regular trips were a result of his own growing importance. He was rapidly becoming known for his ability to keep many a situation from spiraling out of control. Hey man, that promotion? Good for you, bro, you deserve it. But just saying, you miiiiiight want to take a step back and take it easy for a bit. Ever heard of work-life balance? ‘Cause the way I see it, you’re overworked as fuck.“De—” The governor faked a cough to stop himself from revealing my identity. “Sir Yuki, a moment of your time, please?”
“Yeah? What’s up?”
“I understand that the two of you are planning to wed. Will you be sharing a room?”
“Sure, why n—” I raised a finger, cut myself off, and turned towards the hero the moment I realized that it was best for me to consult her before I agreed to anything. “Any objections, Nell?”Her face flushed a deep shade of scarlet as she kept her eyes glued to the floor. Slowly, slowly but surely, she nodded. The action led me to cross my arms and laugh, heartily.“I-I know I shouldn’t be this embarrassed. You, Lefi, and I sleep together all the time. But my heart’s pounding. Because this is the first time it’s just us.”
“Sorry, what? I wasn’t really paying attention.”My cackle had led me to miss whatever she had mumbled under her breath.“N-nothing!” she said in a conspicuously loud voice.The odd reaction and the big smile that accompanied it led me to raise an eyebrow in suspicion, but decided not to pursue the topic and instead asked the question I’d thought up whilst totally paying attention to everything she was saying.“So you know how you work for the church?”
“Mhm?”
“Yeah, so I was thinking about that. Does that mean you’re basically a part of the clergy?”
“Yeah?”
“So uhhh… is this okay? Does it violate any of your commandments? ‘Cause last I heard, clergy life sucks, and is just about as strict as strict gets,” I said. “And then there’s the whole thing with me being married already. Iunno what you guys think of polygamy, but I’m not expecting it not to be frowned upon.”Most of my religious knowledge stemmed from what I’d known when I lived on Earth. The fact that this world very much resembled the way my old one had looked in the middle ages, a part of me had suspected that devoting one’s chastity to the lord would not have been too strange a practice. Not that I’m actually about to let some stupid god keep me from Nell’s chastity. That shit’s mine. I’m just asking so I can figure out what’s normal and make sure we keep up appearances.Nell’s first reaction was to open her eyes wide. The concerned tone I’d spoken in caught her off guard. But soon, she switched gears and began giggling for reasons outside my comprehension.“W-what?” I asked, self-consciously.
“Just that it seems a bit late to be asking me something like that.” Again, she giggled. “Because that sounds like the type of thing most people would have considered much, much earlier in the relationship.”
“Well I’m sorry I’m not like most other people then.” I rolled my eyes indignantly. “I never really thought about it, so I only just realized that you might actually be some kinda nun.”
“I don’t think you’d mind even if I was,” she said with a teasing smile. “No sensible demon lord would ever end up marrying a hero, after all.”
“Oh, shut up. You’re the one who came onto me,” I grumbled.
“I know.” She stuck out her tongue. “To answer your question, it’s okay. Some other religions impose all sorts of restrictions on polygamy and marriage, but my God is just as uncaring as you are. As far as God is concerned, love is all that really matters.”
“Alright, in that case, it sounds like we’re all green,” I said.
“Mhm.”Nell and I began to gaze at each other. She returned my smile with one of her own. Man, she’s cute. Talk about a jackpot.I slowly raised my hand, and slowly moved it towards her cheek, but was stopped by a cough right before I was about to hoist up the anchor and send us sailing off to flirt-land.Nell and I both turned in the direction of the sound, only to realize that the old governor was, in fact, still present, alive, and kicking. The look on his face was one sat about halfway between stunned and unamused. I couldn’t tell exactly which it leaned closer to, but whatever the case, he was very clearly telling us to get a room. Literally. One of the soldiers standing beside the balding old man was dangling a pair of keys in our direction.“…I’m glad to see that your relationship is still healthy.” He chose his words carefully and did his best to remain as dignified and unaffected by the display as possible. “My subordinates have brought you the keys to your room.”
“Errr… my bad.”
“W-we’re sorry, Governor,” mumbled a flustered Nell.
“I almost cannot believe that you two are on such good terms.” His voice was a bit quieter than usual, softened by what could only be described as shock. He laughed, dryly, then continued, “Never in my wildest dreams have I ever expected to find myself so entertained and satisfied by the sight of a hero and demon lord in love…”<– Prev — Next –>

Rest Stop — Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Thank you for taking care of all the paperwork, Governor.” Nell shuffled her feet awkwardly as she retrieved our keys from the old man’s subordinate. “P-please excuse us.”
“Err… yeah, what she said. See ya later dude. And take it easy.” Like the hero, I turned my eyes away from the man I was speaking to out of a sense of shame.
“…Rest well. We will be departing first thing in the morning.”After saying our goodbyes, we turned in the direction of our room and headed out for the night. Or at least that was what we had intended. I made it no further than halfway down the hall before freezing in place. A strange, tingling sensation had run up my spine. Danger was coming.“Yuki? What’s wrong?” Nell turned to face me right as the expression on my face switched from one of alertness to one of annoyance.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake… I just wanted to kick back, take it easy, and relax. I guess that’s not happening anymore.” I sighed. “Get your sword ready. You’re probably going to need it.”Her hands shot to her blade. One held up her sheath, and the other sat on the weapon’s hilt as she began scanning her surroundings. Though she wasn’t able to detect the threat I had hinted at, there was no doubt or questioning in her response, only trust.“Is something the matter?” The manner in which we had both suddenly shifted gears caused the old governor to take notice.
“There’s a big-ass group of monsters inbound. They’re headed straight for the city.”
“What!?”
“How long will it take them to reach the city?” asked Nell.
“Not long. They’ll probably reach the walls in the next 30 minutes.”I quickly looked over my map after answering her and made note of an oddity. The monster army shared our trajectory; they approached the city from the same direction we had. Is it just me, or does this seem like a setup?The horde’s makeup was composed of orcs, ogres, goblins, and various other human-like monsters not considered a part of the intelligent races. There were a few other beast-like monsters as well, mainly boars and wolves. These creatures served as mounts and carried members of the more humanoid species on their backs.My proclamation was met with something along the lines of a public announcement. The clamouring of what was probably a giant metal bell began ringing throughout the city, resounding off its outer walls and spreading through each and every one of its alleys. The other guests began to stir as they realized that there was an emergency. Local authorities shouted loudly in order to calm the people down and steer them to safety. Their voices were so loud I could clearly hear them even through the inn’s thick walls.“I almost find it difficult to believe that you were able to detect them more quickly than the watchmen even without the use of your eyes,” said the governor, “but I suppose I should have expected nothing less from a demon lord.”
“Yeah, well, where I live, you’ve gotta be at least this good at sniffing out potential threats if you don’t want to die,” I said. “Anyway, you’re supposed to be some kinda big shot politician nowadays, right? Shouldn’t you be getting the hell outta here and holing yourself up somewhere safe?”
“Of course not. As a member of the nobility, it is my duty to step forward precisely at times like these and fight for the people. Sir Gamdia!”
“At your service, my liege!”The other person I recognized, the old commander, straightened his back, stepped forward from his position at the governor’s side, and even saluted for added effect the moment his name was called.“Rally every last man. This is no time to rest,” said Raylow, without a moment’s hesitation. “Inform them that we will be marching to Governor Nigel’s manor immediately, and that we will be offering him our aid.”
“By your command, sir. I’ll have them ready to depart immediately.”The knight left with all the vigour and energy typically exhibited by members of the military and began acting on his orders without a moment’s delay.“Yuki, could you please… help me help them?” asked Nell.
“Sure. I don’t mind. Hell, you didn’t even need to say please.” I shrugged as I flashed my teeth. Evidently, the combination of the statement and my nonchalant reaction had eased Nell’s worries, as the somber expression on her face was soon replaced with a smile.
“Are the two of you planning to take action?” asked the governor as he approached.
“Well, I won’t do nothing. I probably wouldn’t be able to sleep too well with bells going off and idiots pounding at the gates all night,” I grumbled. “Besides, little miss hero over here decided to ask me to help, so now I’m more or less obligated to pitch in, one way or another. I’m probably going to fly around for a bit, put a plan together, and act on it once I figure out exactly what’s going on.”
“Which direction are they coming from?” asked Nell.
“Same direction we came from, which is pretty weird because literally none of the monsters there were even the slightest bit hostile while we were passing through, but whatever.”
“Okay. If that’s the case, then I’ll head straight for the gate. Can you keep me updated if you learn anything important?”
“Sure. I’ll make sure I stop by the gate once I finish scouting things out.” I turned to face the governor. “So yeah, we’re basically gonna play it by ear.”
“If that’s the case, we’ll be operating under the assumption that you’ll be working alongside us,” he said. “Normally, this would be the type of situation in which I would have to prepare myself for death, but with the two of you here, I feel much more at ease.”
“I got this. Everything’ll be fine. Hell, you could probably just kick back and chill, right Nell?”
“Maybe. It depends on whether or not you mess up and start screaming profanities at the top of your lungs,” she said. “Because you let your guard down, trip over your own feet, and end up doing exactly that all the time.”
“Oh, shush,” I averted my gaze. “But you’re right. I’ll make sure I keep my eyes peeled.”
“I doubt I’ll have anything to worry about if the two of you are that relaxed,” laughed the governor. “But whatever the case, I wish you the best of luck.”***“Sir Nigel!”Alfyro’s governor, Raylow Lurubia, burst into his colleague’s manor with such fervour that the other lord had almost mistaken him for an attacker.“Sir Raylow!? Why are you here?” Sengillia’s governor turned away from the guard he was speaking to and faced the entrance to his mansion.“I was on my way to the capital and chose to spend the night at a local inn. I rushed over the moment I realized that the city was in danger. Please let me know if there is anything my troops and I can do to help.”
“That seems rather unfortunate on your part, but I’m grateful you’re here. Fighting alongside the man once known as the god of war is very reassuring indeed.”
“That was a long, long time ago, Sir Nigel,” laughed Raylow, dryly. “Would you happen to have any detailed information of the situation at hand. I’ve learned nothing beyond the fact that we are being attacked by a horde of monsters.”
“I see your ears are as sharp as always, Sir Raylow. Nothing truly escapes you, does it?” Nigel sighed. “It is exactly as you say. One of the men standing watch spotted a legion of monsters marching towards the town. There are hundreds of them approaching, and not nearly as many of us.”
“Hundreds? That certainly is quite the number…”
“To be exact, their ranks are made of orcs, ogres, goblins, and various riders. Many of the species spotted are of the menace class in terms of their threat level.” Sengillia’s lord pinched the bridge of his nose. “If I must be, it is effectively a stampede, and one that occurred without any warning.”Nigel’s expression was grim. There was a chance he would soon lose everything, that his men, his people, and even his life would soon be forfeit. For a moment, Raylow shared in his gloom, but unlike the other man’s, Raylow’s frown was stained with hope.“There is a stroke of luck in all this,” he muttered.
“What are you trying to say?”
“Or perhaps not. It depends on the viewpoint.” Raylow sighed. “It frustrates me to rely almost entirely on their efforts. Hiding behind a greater power in the face of violence is cowardly. But I can confidently say that, with the two of them present, the cleanup is sure to be a much greater worry than the invasion itself.”Nigel wasn’t quite able to keep up with Raylow’s rant, so he ended up raising a brow as he listened to the man speak of a solution that only those already in the know would understand.<– Prev — Next –>

The Stampede — Part 1
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“Welp, time to find the asshole responsible for this mess.”I popped my stealth skill, spread my wings, and rocketed my way into the night sky. The darkness did nothing to impede me; my body was far too high spec to find itself deterred by a lack of light. Directing my eyes towards the horde was all I needed to do to observe it in detail.“Damn… That’s a lot of monsters.”My map had already informed me of the size of the force I would be dealing with. But seeing it approach with my own two eyes gave the monstrous army a whole new sense of impact. Creatures that normally lived deep within the forest had left their habitats in droves to march to civilization. Branches were snapped underfoot and grasslands were trampled beyond recognition as the horde senselessly pushed forward without the slightest care for the damage they caused on the way.There weren’t enough of them to traumatize me, as the Wicked Forest’s ants had, but still, I found myself almost completely overwhelmed by their sheer numbers. Fortunately, I was able to reel in my sense of awe by focusing on the observation that their ranks lacked even the slightest sense of order. Infighting was ever prevalent. When two groups belonging to different species found themselves side by side, they would cause damage to each other’s ranks. They would squabble, fight, cripple, and kill without remorse. It was chaos.Nell had explicitly cautioned me against letting down my guard, which, admittedly, I often did. I had the tendency to shut off my brain and act without thinking of much, if at all. That said, I was sure that I would be able to resolve the situation at hand even if I did accidentally let my focus slip. All the practice I had put into fighting large groups had paid off. I’d gotten fairly skilled at wiping out hordes of monsters far more powerful than this one, and I was confident that I would be given no trouble whatsoever. Looks like playing scout paid off. Now I don’t just think I can dick around. I know I can.“Now all I have to do is worry about dealing with him,” I made a note to self as I turned my eyes back towards the city. And my one remaining concern. Ehhh… you know what? He doesn’t really seem to be doing much. Hell, he’s more or less just sitting around and watching shit happen. I’m willing to bet he’s already done his part, so I’m just going to put him on the shit-list and deal with him later. First thing’s first, gotta get these damn monsters off the chopping block.***I directed my gaze downwards after repositioning myself over the ramparts, where I found Nell running back and forth, carrying supplies wherever she went. Most of the goods she delivered consisted of arrows and cannonballs, projectiles that the soldiers could use to defend their homes from afar. She wasn’t the only individual transporting ammunition. Many other soldiers, merchants, and civilians were doing the same. There simply weren’t enough shells or bolts where they needed to be. The attack had been far too sudden to give the guards enough of a warning to prepare.At first, I suspected that the townspeople had lent their aid out of goodwill because they wanted the soldiers to succeed, but I soon realized that I couldn’t have been further from the mark. They weren’t contributing to the war effort because they wanted to help, but rather, because they wanted to live. Just as there hadn’t been any time to restock on ammo, there hadn’t been any time for an evacuation. Helping the men that would soon take to the front lines was the only thing that any noncombatant could do to better his or her chance at survival.I landed in an obscure corner, retracted my wings, and exited Stealth upon ensuring that there wasn’t anyone looking my way. After a few minutes worth of navigation, I found myself close enough to everybody’s favourite hero to catch her attention without raising my voice.“Hey.”
“Hey Yuki.” She finished putting down the box she was carrying and turned to face me. “Wait… Are you really wearing one of those silly masks again…?”
“Of course,” I said, a matter-of-factly, “every hero’s gotta have a mysterious dude with a mask in their party. That’s just how the world works. It’s the natural order of things, and basically an unbreakable law.”
“Uh huh… Sure, Yuki, whatever you say.” She smiled, wryly.The mask I had put on wasn’t any old mask. It was the exact same one I had worn the last time I had visited Nell’s country. It featured a fairly simple design, with a star under one eye, and a teardrop under the other. While I certainly did find the mask to be, for lack of a better term, totally badass as fuck, style had not in fact been the main reason I had opted to don it. I knew that keeping my identity a secret would provide me an edge and allow me to play my cards more easily.“So, yeah, I finished checking everything out.” I reached for a few boxes and started to help out as I talked. “The horde’s more or less made up of nothing but goblins and orcs. The strongest-looking guys were the ogres, which basically means there’s nothing but small fry. We can wipe ‘em out easy.”
“I’m not really sure ogres count as ‘small fry.’ Most people are terrified of them,” said Nell. “But as much it freaks me out to think this, I can see where you’re coming from. The things you and your pets fight in the Wicked Forest are way stronger than ogres could ever be.”
“Yeah, it should be easy unless I trip over my own feet.” I said with a chuckle. “Er, well, more like I guess it would be if I was going to be handling this the way I normally would, but I’m not. I wouldn’t be doing you any favours by sticking around and showing off, so I’m going to be keeping out of sight and staying as far from the spotlight as I can.”
“I don’t really think it matters, does it?”
“It does.” I answered her question with a shake of the head. “I know this is just going to sound like I’m bragging and being a piece of shit, but I’m not. I’m too strong.” I frowned. “I’m not exactly all that good at the whole finesse thing. Since I rely mostly on brute force, I end up being about as flashy as flashy gets. And I’m not just talking about my spells either. If I accidentally punched an orc too hard, it’d probably explode. And that means I’m basically guaranteed to draw more eyes than you. Normally, that’d be fine, but you’re not exactly doing all that well in terms of job security right now. The last thing we need is for people to start spreading rumours about you being weaker than one of your companions.”
“Ughh…” She groaned in a mix of displeasure and sadness. “Yeah, I guess you’re right…”Naturally, my intention hadn’t been to make her feel down, so I kept talking.“But, you see Nell, it ain’t all bad news. Because this is the perfect chance for you to show an entire city that you’re the real deal.”
“I-I’m not really sure chance is the right word here…”
“Sure it is. All you have to do to prove that you’re worthy of your title is run down a ragtag group of monsters and call it a day.” I knew she wasn’t quite convinced just yet, so I changed up my approach. “Alright, think about it this way.” I pointed towards the monsters. “That right there isn’t a horde about to knock on the city’s gates. It’s an opportunity. They’ve brought you their lives on a silver fucking platter. All you gotta do is open the door and start swinging. That’s it. You got this.”A moment of silence passed as she gazed upon the approaching monsters.“Okay… I’ll give it a shot.”
“That’s the spirit. You get em, tiger.” I brought my lips closer to her ears as I switched from laughing in amusement to speaking in the gravest of tones. “Watch your back. There aren’t any monsters in the city. But that doesn’t mean we’re without any enemies. I’ve picked up on one sitting around inside the city.”
“What!?” Nell reacted with a start. “Are you sure we shouldn’t be dealing with him right away? What if he does something while we’re fighting?”
“I wouldn’t worry too much about it. He hasn’t been doing much besides just biding his time,” I said. “I think he’s probably already done his part and just sticking around to see the aftermath, but I’ll be keeping an eye on him just in case.”And I mean literally. I had deployed a cloaked evil eye in his vicinity, and not just any old evil eye. The item I had put to use this time was effectively a mark two. It still resembled a mark one in that it held the same silhouette, but was now a good bit larger. The mark two model traded its smaller form factor for a much larger battery. Its upgraded powercell was able to hold enough juice to keep it running for a full two hours. Heh. The more the dungeon grows, the better my tools get. Won’t be long before I have a whole bag of top-secret gadgets up my sleeve at this rate.“Well, looks like they’re almost here, so I better head off,” I said. “But yeah, like I said, just take it easy and do your thing. The monsters you’re up against are weak. This’ll be a cakewalk so long as you stay on your toes.”
“Okay. I’ll keep that in mind and do my best.”
“Alright. You all set?”She nodded, so I took the liberty of going on ahead. I placed one foot off the side of the wall and allowed myself to fall. Upon hitting the ground, I turned and motioned to the brown-haired girl atop the ramparts to follow.“Do I really have to…?” She groaned, but shook off her hesitation almost immediately. “Oh, fine!”I repositioned myself and made sure to catch her before she hit the ground. One of my hands ended up under her knees, while the other supported her back.“That was terrifying… And it wasn’t even my first time doing it,” she said in a whisper.
“Oh yeah, something like this did already happen, didn’t it?”
“Mhm. It was back at the bar, remember? You went off the rails and started making fun of someone’s hair.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. This is definitely the first time this has happened,” I said in a flat tone.She gave me a blatant, disapproving, silent glare, but I averted my eyes as much as humanly possible as I set her down.“Hey! Someone get over here! I just saw a couple guys fall off the ramparts! I think they might’ve gotten stuck outside!” reported a civilian.
“W-What!? That’s terrible! Open the gates, and hurry! Get them in here before the monsters get close enough to attack!” One of the soldiers barked an order at another before looking over the wall. “Hey! You guys alright down there?”The response led me to frown.“Soooo… uh… I kinda wasn’t planning on having them open the gate.” I said with a sheepish grin. “And that doesn’t exactly seem like the best idea with the horde as close as it is. You got any ideas?”
“Mhm!” nodded the brunette. “I’ve got just the thing.”She raised an arm and pointed it at the ramparts with her palm open and her fingers straight.“Barrier of Separation!”A massive wall expanded out from her hand. The gargantuan construction, which ran parallel to the city’s outer bulwark, more than just spanned the the entire settlement. It went on for as far as even my eyes could see.“W-what the hell!?”
“W-where’d that come from!?”The soldiers began shouting. Their voices were laced with confusion and panic, and they clearly demanded an explanation. But I decided to pay them a grand total of zero percent of my attention and instead direct it all towards Nell’s newly formed roadblock.“Huh… Neat. So this is what your barriers look like?”
“Mhm.” She leaned towards me and smiled. “Oh yeah, that’s right. I never did get the chance to show you this unique skill of mine,”: she said. “It’s really sturdy. It’ll be able to keep our allies safe from any stray projectiles. The only downside to it is that it cuts us off from the scoundrel in town. I won’t be able to stop him if he does anything. But I’m sure you’ll be able to sneak in, even if worse comes to worst, right?”
“Probably, yeah.”I was curious as to the barrier’s sturdiness, so I decided to rap it a few times with my knuckles. After confirming that it at least sounded solid, I punched it just for good measure. Much to my surprise, it remained completely unscathed. I, however, did not. Ow… I don’t know why I didn’t expect that to hurt. Note to self: don’t punch walls.The wall’s ability to hold against one of my attacks proved that it more than sufficed. We no longer needed to worry about any of the civilians or soldiers; any considerations with regards to spells and projectile weapons were well accounted for. We were free to let loose and go wild.“Wow. Honestly, I’m pretty damn impressed.” I reached into my inventory, grabbed one of the MP Potions I literally never used, and chucked it at her as I spoke. “But it looks like that one cast drained half your mana. Here, take one of these. It’ll make up for it.”
“Thanks!” She took it to her lips, only to grimace as she tasted its contents. “Wow… it’s really bitter.”Though she didn’t enjoy the restorative, she ended up gulping down the rest of its contents in one breath. I took the momentary lull in the conversation as an opportunity to pull my good old favorite weapon out from my personal rift in space.“Hey Enne, you ready?”
“Mhm…” The blade almost seemed to yawn as it responded, slowly and groggily. “…Fight time?”
“Yeah. Sorry, were you asleep? I didn’t mean to wake you up without any warning, but something’s come up.”
“It’s okay…”Enne was my signature weapon. There simply wasn’t any way I could have possibly left her behind. The only reason she hadn’t been out in the open was because she had wanted to give Nell and I some time alone. I had in fact been looking for an opportunity to let her get some fresh air for quite some time, but neither of our rides had ended up being the most enjoyable experiences, so I had ultimately opted to keep her tucked away. The plan I settled on was letting her out as soon as we stepped into our room, but the incident at hand sent my agenda flying out the window. Sorry for keeping you locked up for so long, Enne. Thanks for bearing with it. I promise I’ll spend a whole day playing with you once we get back from this trip.“Yuki.” Nell spoke my name in a worried tone. Following her eyes led me to direct my gaze towards the countless torchlights with which the night was lit. The army was massive. There were so many monsters coming our way that their footsteps had merged into a never-ending, loud rumble.I slung Enne over my shoulder and turned to face the incoming horde. A grin crept on my face, not that it could be seen beneath the mask I had donned.“Looks like we better get down to business.” Turning only my eyes towards the hero, I spoke to signal that the time had come.The hunt was on.<– Prev — Next –>

The Stampede — Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Errrr, actually hold that thought real quick.” Yuki spun around as he spoke in a casual tone. The sudden change immediately deconstructed the mood he had only just set. “You mind letting me see your sword real quick?”
“My sword?” Nell immediately complied. Though she had been caught off guard by the sudden demand, she presented him with her holy blade without even a moment’s hesitation. “Sure. Here.”He began staring at it fixedly after grabbing it with his spare hand. For reasons beyond Nell’s comprehension, the weapon’s glow, which could normally be described as a dull white light, rapidly grew in brightness. It became so vibrant, so lustrous that looking at its blade made the hero squint. And that wasn’t the only change. It began vibrating in a manner that could almost be described as violent. It almost seemed ready to burst.“Alright… that should be enough.”
“Yuki, what did you do to Durandal…?” asked Nell in wonder. “I don’t really think it’s supposed to glow like that…”
“Oh, you know, just a thing,” said the demon lord. “Kinda supercharged it with a bit of mana. No big deal.”
“You what?”
“Supercharged it. Anyway, try projecting the magical energy stored in the blade outwards when horde finally shows up. You should be able to blow up a good chunk of it if you dump all of the blade’s excess mana in one go.” He spun the weapon around and presented her the handle. “If things start going wrong, just shout and I’ll be right over. Don’t worry about any of the shit I said earlier if it means putting yourself in danger.”
“M-mmk,” she nodded as she received her blade. “I’ll yell if I start to lose control of the situation.”
“Alright, then I’m off.” Yuki gave a casual wave before vanishing into thin air.One of his spells or skills had hidden him from sight, and Nell wasn’t sure which. All she knew was that both he and his sword were gone.“What’s supercharging a weapon even supposed to mean?” she muttered a question under her breath as she looked her now quivering blade up and down. “And how do you manage something like that in the first place?”Her question was left unanswered as a bestial warcry tore her from her thoughts. She wrenched her head up from her blade and looked forward, in the direction from whence it came.Before her stood a veritable army.Their advance was thunderous. Their steps were so heavy they caused the ground to rumble.Her attention had been dragged away from the advancing horde. But she certainly had not forgotten it. The weight of its presence was far too great for her not to remain aware of it.It was closer now.The monsters were sure to be upon her within the next five minutes.And as she stared them down, she recalled Yuki’s instructions.“I’m not really sure exactly what I’m supposed to do with all this mana…” She brandished the blade. “But I think I’ve at least got the gist of it.”She understood the mechanism he wanted her to employ. The Spellblade Strike, the act of launching a sharp magical projectile from one’s weapon, was an incredibly well-known technique. It was the sword art whose name was often spoken alongside that of the world’s most famous butler, the man who held the title of hero before her.Though she had received his instruction, she lacked his mastery. She couldn’t use the Spellblade Strike in battle. But not because she was incapable of performing it. Nell’s problem was her lack of control. She was incapable of reigning the spell in.If she was to fire it in the midst of a battlefield, she was sure to harm friend and foe alike. But, here, there were no allies for her to worry about. There was no need for her to concern herself with keeping her magical energies under control.The one friendly at risk of taking damage from her attack was more than capable of avoiding it. And he knew it was coming. He was the one that instructed her to let the technique loose to begin with. And even if that wasn’t the case, she was sure he would be able to avoid it. His strength put hers to shame.With her worries dismissed, the warrior prepared herself to initiate the assault.A slow, deep breath left her as she raised her sword overhead and chased any remaining unnecessary thoughts from her mind.The approaching footsteps almost seemed to grow distant as she concentrated all her senses on her blade.She was filled with overwhelming strength.An indescribable amount of energy coursed through her as she became one with her blade.She forced it to conform to her will, to take the shape of her weapon and wrap itself around its exterior, sharpening it.With her mind still focused on Durandal, she looked towards her targets.They had noticed her, the foolish human that had left its safe haven to be slain. They were so close she could make out their silhouettes in the darkness and see the bloodlust, the thirst for violence that shone within their eyes.With fervour, they charged her. The fastest amongst them, the wolves and boars, carried their riders forward.And put them within range of her blade.She struck.A battle cry rushed from the depths of her throat as she transformed her blade’s excess mana into a single full-body cleave.But it remained unheard.For the moment she unleashed her attack was the moment everything in her vicinity lost its ability to communicate.Be it through sight or sound.A radiant, deafening explosion overwrote every other sensation. It was as bright as a lightning strike, loud as a thunderbolt, and powerful as the man whose energies had fueled it.Nell’s clothes ruffled violently in the shockwave that followed the attack. The trees shook and the grass whistled as both types of foliage desperately fought to keep themselves rooted. Neither succeeded.Some were torn from their tethers and expelled into the night sky. Others weren’t so lucky.Nell’s Spellblade Strike had obliterated everything in its path. What wasn’t hit directly was sent tumbling through the air, only to be pulverized by the resulting pressure. Even the earth itself had opened up to reveal a gash so wide it could only be described as a tectonic fissure, a fissure that extended far off into the horizon.The horde’s calvary was no more. The army of riders had been forcibly transfigured into an army of corpses.“W-What the hell!?”
“T-That was absurd! W-what power!”
“Did you see the sword!? It was glowing! Wait! Isn’t that the divine blade!?”
“The divine blade!? That’s gotta mean that the girlie down there is the hero!”
“O-of course! That would explain everything! No wonder she’s so powerful!”The term “hero” took only a moment to propagate through the crowd. Soldiers and civilians alike began chanting it with vigour, as if to cling to the hope with which she had blessed them.Naturally, their reaction was not shared by the horde. The monsters that had not fallen victim to her attack stared with their faces blank. It was as if they were stuck attempting to process the sheer extent of the damage the human had dealt.Likewise, the human in question remained unmoving. She too had been stunned into silence. Her jaw, which remained slackened, twitched repeatedly as she stared at the aftermath of her own attack.What the heck, Yuki!? She didn’t say anything out loud, but screamed internally at the top of her lungs. What the heck was that!? Just how much mana did you use!?<– Prev — Next –>

The Stampede — Part 3
Editor(s): Speedphoenix“Oh, looks like Nell’s gone and done the thing.” I looked in the hero’s direction as I heard a massive explosion, only to see it rain blood. Literally. Disemboweled monsters, or rather the remains thereof, fell from the sky en masse and dyed what was left of the terrain with their vital fluids. Ewwww. Yeah, I’mma just look away. Iunno about you, but I’m not exactly what I’d call a fan of gore.“That was loud,” said Enne, telepathically.
“Yeah. And totally awesome,” I said. “That’s just what you get when Nell and I combine forces.”
“Mhm. But it’d be even stronger if we combined forces instead.”The sword stubbornly staked a claim at superiority. You know, now that I think about it, Enne really does like coming out on top in the end, doesn’t she? She’s almost kinda petty, in a way. I wonder who she got that from?“Yeah, I’m sure it would,” I chuckled as I continued to weave my way through the stunned horde.I didn’t bother defeating the enemies I passed by. That wasn’t my role, not today. I had already relinquished the protagonist’s crown and taken it upon myself to play nothing more than a supporting role.While I wasn’t planning on standing out or showing off, I had no intention of kicking back and leaving Nell to handle the situation on her own. There was no reason to put her through any sort of unnecessary stress. I simply couldn’t stand the idea of seeing her suffer an injury as a result of my own stupidity. That was why I opted to dive deep into enemy lines.Weakening the horde was, strategically, no different from weakening any other army. The most valid solution was, under any reasonable circumstance, to eliminate the enemy commander. An army without its command center was only as effective as an unruly mob.Once I’d reached my destination, I undid my Stealth skill and looked towards the hulking titan that I’d marked as my objective.“Hey big guy, how’s the weather up there?”The monster to whom I had directed my greeting was not particularly surprised by my sudden advent. In fact, he had seemed to notice me long before I had revealed myself, as both his eyes had been trained on me for as long as mine had been trained on him. Further evidence of his awareness came in the form of a calm vocal response, a couple low notes strung together into a series of grunts. While I wasn’t able to parse his words into anything intelligible, I did at least understand that he had met my salutation in kind.He was twice my size. Literally. Both his height and his width were double mine. His frame, which was covered from head to toe in large, bulky muscles, was only made all the more intimidating by the countless scars he sported. One of the two horns that protruded from the front of his skull looked to have been snapped in half, another injury likely acquired in battle. His weapon, a club as thick as a trunk, was about as long as I was tall. It was by no means well crafted. It looked like he had literally pulled a tree out of the ground and used whatever he had on hand to crudely carve it into its current shape. Getting hit by that looks like it’d hurt. Not that it actually would, but still. It totally seems like the kind of thing that could make a guy go splat.***
Race: Ogre.
Class: Ogre King
Level: 72
***Analyze’s results confirmed what I had learned from both my map and my scouting efforts. He was their leader, as evidenced by both his level, which far outstripped any other’s, and his title, which blatantly declared him to be the king of the most powerful race present. Unlike goblins, which were only thought of as hazards, both ogres and orcs were considered menace-level threats. That said, the two species were by no means equal. Ogres were higher up the food chain and generally regarded as far more dangerous.Hearing the ogre king’s voice brought the subordinates by his side back to reality. Goblins and orcs alike began squealing and screeching as they brandished their weapons and moved to engage the interloper. But they stopped before they could get in range. The gesture the king had performed, raising a fist such that it ran parallel to his head, had halted them in their tracks. And though they were far from being instilled with a sense of serenity, they did at least stop squawking. Wow. Now that’s what I call a leader. The grip he’s got on his men is tough as iron.To most, his choice would have appeared unjustified. There would have been no better opportunity to swarm me and crush me beneath the weight of his horde. Had such a thing been possible. His army could do nothing to me. And he knew it, just as well as I did.“Look man, I don’t know why you’re here or what you’re after. And frankly, I could care less. I mean, I get it, you’re probably doing this for some sort of a reason, and I’d wager it’s probably a pretty damned good one at that. But it doesn’t matter. This marching on the city thing? Yeah, that ain’t happening.” I didn’t know if the ogre was truly capable of understanding me, but I kept talking regardless. “No hard feelings, bro. Just think of this as a case of bad luck.”I was met with a silent stare as I took a moment to pause for added effect.“But enough talking. This is war, and we stand on different sides of the battlefield. I’m sure you already know exactly how all this works.”I lifted Enne off my shoulder and pointed her blade at the monster’s nose.He slowly closed his eyes and spent another moment in silence.Suddenly, the aura about him began to warp. The moment his eyes shot open yet again was the moment he transformed from a ruler to a warrior. His lips, which had been sealed shut, twisted into a thrilled grin as he raised his club and readied himself for the fight to come. I suspected that this too served as an order, one that conveyed his will to his subordinates, as his men immediately backed off in order to create a ring wide enough to support a duel.“You know, I’ve always wanted to do something like this.” I smiled as I recalled the many historical dramas that had featured situations not all that different from the one at hand. “And by the looks of it, I guess I wasn’t the only one after all.”We showed our hands—He raised his club overhead for a heavy, downwards strike, while I took up a stance with Enne to my side, blade primed and ready to cleave through his torso.—And as he roared, we played them.***“Good evening. Might I borrow a moment of your time?” A well-dressed man tapped one of the men that stood by the city’s gate on the shoulder.
“Of cours—” The knight, one of Sengillia’s most accomplished commanders, turned around, only to panic in a manner reminiscent of a flustered child as he caught onto the speaker’s identity. “S-sir Raylow!? I-it is a great privilege to be in your presence, sir! T-to what do I owe the honour!?”
“I just so happened to be in town.” The retired warlord, who had rushed to the battlefield immediately upon leaving Governor Nigel’s manor, spoke as he gazed at the translucent bulwark that lay between the city’s outer wall and the approaching horde. “Is this one of the hero’s spells?”
“It is exactly that,” said the knight. “The woman we believe to be the hero, created it not long before the fight began. It is nigh impenetrable and has kept my men far out of harm’s way.”As Raylow lowered his gaze from the wall and instead directed it through the gate. The spell’s caster immediately caught his attention. She was acting with all the might of a force of nature. Every monster that approached her was killed with a single, precise strike. She was, in all technicality, playing the role of a defender. Her goal was to protect the city and drive off its invaders. And yet, the way she shredded the enemy’s lines made it appear as if she was the aggressor.“It seems that there was no need for me to be so worried after all,” muttered the governor. He paused for a moment before turning to face the knight once more. “I am not your commander, nor do I hold any sort of honorary position within Sengillia’s forces, so I know that it is rude of me to ask this of you, but might you provide me with a quick status report?”
“N-not at all sir!” replied the flustered knight. “It would be an honour to report directly to a man as skilled in the art of war as yourself!” He took a moment to gather his thoughts before continuing. “The hero has put a stop to the enemy’s advance.” His tone still carried with it a tinge of nervousness, but he had at least composed himself enough to remain clear and concise. “She obliterated the first wave with a powerful spell and is currently in the midst of challenging the second. Thanks to her efforts, we have suffered no casualties whatsoever.”Raylow looked back up at the ramparts, where most of the soldiers stood. As they had been locked out of the battle, there was little they could do to contribute to the war effort but cheer. And cheer they did. Their voices were filled with fervour and excitement. They were enamoured. The old governor chuckled, then furrowed his brow as he realized that the man who should have been accompanying her was nowhere to be seen.“Has she been alone this whole time?” asked Raylow. “I was under the impression she had a companion.”
“We did see someone else down there with her earlier, sir,” said the knight. “We were unable to determine whether this other individual happened to be a man or a woman. Nor were we able to estimate their age. However, the two certainly did interact, so I believe it is safe to assume that they were the companion you are referring to.” The commander raised a hand to his chin. “You bring up a good point though, sir. I have no idea where this companion of hers went, but I’m certain I saw them outside the barrier.”Again, the governor furrowed his brows, this time, to lose himself in thought.The demon lord had joined the battle. Of that, he was certain. There was no reason for a man capable of razing hell itself to run away from an army of low ranking monsters. That could only mean that he was intentionally keeping himself out of sight. Because he wanted to better the hero’s status by letting her take the spotlight.Raylow had no idea as to the exact extent to which the demon lord had planned ahead. But he was confident in two things. The first was his conclusion. There simply wasn’t any other reasonable explanation for the situation at hand. The second was that the demon lord’s plan had worked. A sense of admiration could be seen in every soldier present. The defense of Sengillia was sure to become a topic that would be discussed in every bar they visited. There, it would spread to the bards, who would take it with them on their journeys. It would take no time at all for the whole realm to know of her might and valour.“I almost can’t believe the balls on that man…” The governor brought a hand to the bridge of his nose as he sighed and pondered how boldly—and easily—the hero’s fiance had turned a worst-case situation into a high level publicity stunt.“Sir Raylow, might you have any suggestions as to what our next move should be?” The commander brought the governor back to reality with a well-intended question. “The men are ready to move at your command.”
“I am fairly certain that I am not your commanding officer.” Raylow breathed a sigh as he turned his gaze back upon the battlefield. “The hero is clearly overwhelming the enemy’s forces, but the battlefield is an unpredictable place. You can never know how the tides might change.” He continued to speak in spite of his own protests. “That is why it would be in our best interest to prepare for any potential eventuality to come. We must be ready to rush to her aid if need be.” The ex-warlord smiled, provocatively. “She is strong. But I’m sure that you know as well as I do that no true warrior would ever leave a battle to be fought by a single woman. I don’t know if it’s possible for us to find a way through this wall, but let us at least try. Deploy a group of elites, one that can hold their own and prove to her that Sengillia’s soldiers are men of valour.”
“Right away sir,” said the commander with a chuckle. “I can’t back down from a challenge like that one. The warrior’s blood in me is already itching to prove to you, the hero, and the horde that Sengillia’s soldiers are as far from cowardly as can be!”The knight saluted the old war hero before leaving to rally his men. His pace was brisk, filled with energy, vigour, and inspiration.Seeing the excess enthusiasm radiate off the other man’s body led Raylow to frown, anxiously.“Was that really the best choice…?” He pondered to himself as he gazed upon the girl fighting outside the city’s walls. He suspected that the answer was yes. It was important for the hero to demonstrate that she could work in a team. He felt that being amicable and working in a team would ultimately lead her to be more well-liked than if she were to stay a beacon of power whose kindness and humanity remained unknown. “I can only pray that all goes as planned.”<– Prev — Next –>

The Stampede — Part 4
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“And that’s game,” I said to the ogre beneath me. “I win.” He lay with his back against the ground and my feet against his chest. I lowered my hips and spread my legs in a classic slav squat as I pressed Enne against his neck.After a moment of observation, the ogre let go of his club. It was over; he’d accepted the fact that he’d lost. Though I very well could have, I refrained from finishing him. I instead hoisted Enne back over my shoulder, stood up, and got off the oversized monster lord.“Alright big guy, you’ve got two choices. One, you take your men and get the hell outta here.” I jerked my jaw in the direction they’d come from. “Two, I kill every last one of you. I’m fine with either or, so the choice is yours.”Though I’d claimed impartiality, I was about as far from neutral as could be. The truth of the matter was that I’d only left him alive because I wanted him to avoid option number two. I highly doubted that it would be possible for me, or anyone, to take control of the ogre king’s unruly mob if he was slain. The moment he died would be the moment they scattered. And I was not thrilled by the idea of going through the pain that was chasing down stragglers. That was why I very much preferred the first of the two options. Having the king retreat with all his men in tow would be as ideal as ideal got.Fortunately, he was willing to comply. The wild warrior-like expression on his face was replaced by the calm gaze I’d seen him wear earlier as he pushed himself off the ground with his monstrously bulky arms and stood up. He looked at me, the forest, and then me again before nodding in understanding. Wow. He’s pretty damn smart for some random monster. Are all ogres like this? Or is he just like a genius or something?Observing his compatriots informed me that the first of the two options was much more likely to be correct. Unlike the orcs and goblins, who seemed to be senselessly screeching for blood, the ogres remained calm with their arms crossed. None seemed to bear even the slightest trace of agitation, rage, or blind bloodlust. I could tell that they were willing to honour the duel I’d fought against their boss and accept its outcome. So that probably means they’ve got some kind of warrior-like culture going on. I had no idea monsters were actually so… diverse. I’ve always just been kind of lumping them together. Huh.The ogre looked towards the city’s walls and shouted an order. At first, his men seemed reluctant to back down. The orcs and ogres, still thirsty of blood, filed complaints in the form of high pitched screeches and low groans. But they were silenced immediately. A second, less patient roar from the king drove them to wistfully turn around and initiate a retreat.After seeing that he had fulfilled his end of the deal, the monster gave me one last look, a meaningful smile, as he turned around and marched away.“Oh, yeah, just saying, I wouldn’t worry too much about negative repercussions or anything,” I said. “I’ll handle all the shit that hits the fan on our end.”Rather than turning around and offering a response, the ogre did nothing but silently walk on with his horde in tow.***After confirming that the wave had truly receded, I headed back to the city, and in doing so, immediately caught sight of Nell. It was hard, if not impossible to miss her, or at least the group that surrounded her as soon as she had taken down her barrier. Each and every man was cheering wildly, repeating the word “hero” over and over with enough enthusiasm to be mistaken for zealotry. The girl in question was forcing a sheepish smile. She didn’t seem to know what she was supposed to do about all the attention the soldiers were showering her with. Heh. All according to plan. I knew playing secret agent would work.“There you are!” She called out to me the moment she saw me.
“Hey,” I waved back as I waded through the crowd. “Looks like someone’s clearly making the morning news tomorrow.”
“Did you know that this was going to happen?” she asked.
“More or less,” I said with a shrug. “I wasn’t sure if everything would really turn out the way I hoped it would, but I figured there’d be a pretty good chance that they’d start to treat you like a hero if you do hero things.”
“Oh, so this is all your fault…”She pouted at me just long enough for me to be sure it was intentional before allowing her displeasure to melt into a bit of a half-miffed half-happy smile.“Who might this be, milady?” One of the soldiers, specifically one whose armour was just a tiny bit fancier than everyone else’s, stepped forward. Guess he’s probably the CO around here or something.
“Oh, he’s uhm…”
“Think of me as one of her subordinates.” Nell began stumbling over her words, so I took over.
“Yeah. That.” Apparently, she didn’t like my answer, as she ended up giving me a clear look of dissatisfaction.Oh, fine…“And I’m also her fiance, just in case any of you were wondering,” I said. “We’re in the middle of heading over to the capital to take care of a bit of business.”
“W-what!?” The commander did a classic double-take, his voice tinged with disappointment. “T-the two of you are engaged!?”
“Mhm.” Nell nodded as she flashed a bashful smile.Looks like she’s happy now. What a cutie pie.I crouched, grabbed her by the legs, hoisted her onto my shoulders, and lifted her into the air as I stood back up. The newfound, embarrassing position led her to eep in surprise.“Take a good, long look, men!” I used my diaphragm to project my voice so I could be heard over the crowd. “This is our saviour! Our hero!”
“Oh my gosh! Yuki!! Let me down!!” She squealed in a voice too quiet for anyone but me to hear. “This is so embarrassing!”
“Woooooooo! Long live the hero!” shouted a soldier.
“Long live our saviour!” echoed another.
“She’s so strong and beautiful she might as well be a goddess!” added a third.A wide smirk appeared under my mask as the men cheered.“And she’s all mine!” I said with a cackle. “Get cucked, y’thirsty cocksuckers! I bet you’re all jealous as fuck!”
“What!?”
“S-she’s already taken!? This can’t be!”
“Noooooooo!! I was just about to ask her out!”The men, who had been roaring with excitement, twisted their cheers into jeers immediately. Many shouted abusive curses colourful enough to rival my own while others grumbled and resigned themselves to a hero-less life. Some of the most jealous individuals had even started kicking at my feet with a surprising amount of force. I was almost convinced they were trying to break my legs—not that they could. Humans were far frailer than demon lords, after all. I got revenge by cackling even more loudly, and pissing them off all the more in doing so. Almost everyone was making some sort of noise. The only one who wasn’t was Nell, who had spent the entire time doing her absolute best to keep her cherry-coloured face covered with her hands.As much as I wanted to relish in the lively atmosphere, it wasn’t meant to last. A loud shout cut through the crowd and poured a bucket of ice water all over our post-victory celebrations.“What a farce! You think the hero is our saviour!? That’s bullshit!”Turning my head in the voice’s direction, I saw a man dressed in a set of merchant-like attire. And I wasn’t the only one. Many of the knights joined me in shooting him an irritated glare.So the serpent finally rears its ugly head. Great. Just great.“I bet she’s the only reason the monsters even showed up to begin with! It’s clearly because they wanted that stupid bitch you call a hero dead!”
“You think that the stampede was the hero’s fault? What nonsense!” shouted the commander. “Did you not see how hard she fought to drive it away!?”Many others voiced their agreement, but their angry grumbles did nothing to dissuade the “merchant.”“So you’re telling me that you think a massive horde like that just so happened to coincidentally come out of nowhere the day she arrives in town!?” He pointed a finger at her. “There’s no way that’s possible! None of the usual signs of a stampede like that were even close to being present! They clearly only came here because she did! She’s the one responsible for putting us in danger!”
“I would never do an—”
“Shut up, wench!” Nell tried to defend herself but was cut off before she could even finish her first sentence. “You’re nothing but a liar, a hypocrite, and a false idol! You’re no saviour! You’re just a walking threat to humanity! You don’t deserve to be called a hero!”The sensation of Nell trembling under the weight of his words ran through my shoulders. He was getting to her.So this is what you were up to. No wonder you were just hanging around until the battle was over. I gazed at my surroundings and confirmed that, while most of the soldiers remained unswayed by his argument, some had started to cast suspicious gazes in Nell’s direction. You know what, Fine? You wanna do this? We can fucking do this. I’ll play by your rules. But know this, asshole. You’ve fucked with the wrong demon lord. If you think you can match me in rhetoric, you better think again. I win arguments against the goddamn Supreme Dragon every fucking day. So bring it on, I’ll talk you into a hole.And once I’m done, I’ll even do you the favour of burying you in it. Because whatever you say, one thing’s not going to change. I’m going to fucking murder you.<– Prev — Next –>

Side Story: One Spooky Halloween NightEditor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Trick or treat!” said Illuna and Shii, in sync.“…Treat.” said Enne.“All three of you look real good in those costumes!” said Lyuu.“Happy Halloween to you too,” giggled Leila, as she provided each of the three children with a number of candies. “And Enne, you’re not saying it correctly. It’s meant to be ‘trick or treat.’ If you only say treat, then you’ll just be asking for sweets.”“Mhm… I know,” said the sword. “I don’t want to play tricks. I just want treats.”Everyone had dressed for the occasion. Illuna was wearing a costume that featured a demon’s wings and horns, Shii had morphed her body to feature a wolf’s ears and tail, and Enne had put on a witch’s robe alongside a big, pointy hat. Likewise, Lyuu and Leila were also in their celebratory clothes. The wolf had a big scar across her face and a screw popping out of her head, while the sheep had cat ears and a long black tail sticking out of her similarly coloured one piece dress.All the costumes present had been purchased by Yuki. He’d been mystified by their presence within the catalog, and even made an odd comment or two, not that any of the girls had caught it.“I believe it was… ‘Trick or treat?’”The dragon was wearing a costume that, for most part, matched Enne’s, with the biggest difference being that hers featured a large, hollowed out pumpkin in place of a hat.“Lefi? Why’re you trick or treatin’? Ain’t you supposed to be one of the ones helpin’ us hand out all the candy?” said Lyuu, who gave the other girl a bit of a suspicious, accusatory stare.“I-I have not the slightest clue as to what it is you mean,” stuttered the awkward pumpkin. “F-for I am not Lefi, but the Jack O’ Lantern, the spectre of death known for striking fear into the hearts of the helpless and imbuing their dreams with horrors untold. You too shall forever suffer a curse should you refuse to provide me with an offering.”“That’s kinda terrifyin’, comin’ from you, so do a gal a favour ‘n knock it off,” said Lyuu. “And wasn’t the Jack O’ Lantern just the wisp that Master was tellin’ us about? It ain’t supposed to be anythin’ too horrible.”“That is but a trivial detail, and one for which I care not,” said Lefi. “I demand that you pay it no more attention and provide me with chocolate.”“You’re bein’ so awfully blunt about what you want that I’m startin’ to think I shouldn’t give it to you,” said Lyuu.“I think it’s okay. She deserves it, with how well made her costume is,” said Leila, with a giggle. “Here you are, Lefi.”“It pleases me to see that you understand, Leila,” said Lefi. “Halloween is a splendid holiday, one which I would be very much willing to celebrate each and every night.”“You’d have to get Master on board,” The sweet tooth-driven comment led Lyuu to give the other girl a bit of a wry smile. “Speakin’ of master, where is he? He’s normally not one to take a long time to get ready, but he just up ‘n vanished after grabbin’ Nell.”“I have no idea,” said Leila. “I can’t even begin to imagine what he might be up to this time. It could be any number of things.”“I concur,” said Lefi, with a chuckle “But as one who knows him well I can surmise it is a task in which he has put plenty of effort, and one that we likely will not understand. When he returns, he is sure to dazzle us, be it with his idiocy, or something truly impressive.”“I know, right? Master always puts loads o’ time into the weirdest things.”“He certainly does,” said Leila. “His sensibilities are a bit different from ours. Or anyone’s, for that matter.”The door creaked open just as the three burst into a fit of laughter. And from it, entered the man of the house, who, for some odd reason, was carrying Nell on his back. He was covered in head to toe in bandages, much like some sort of still-living mummy, whereas she was dressed as a bat; a layer of fabric extended from her arms all the way down to her waist to make it look as if she had a pair of wings.“Alright, everyone ready?” he asked, as soon as he entered. “Let’s get this party started!”“…I hate you, Yuki,” whimpered Nell.“What is it that you have done to her? And why is she glaring at you so reproachfully?” asked Lefi. “Her legs are trembling with such fright I am beginning to suspect you have rendered her incapable of walking on her own.”“Oh, you know, nothing special. Few random things happened here and there, and she ended up being a little too scared to walk. No big deal.”“No big deal? No big deal!? What do you mean, no big deal!? You ordered them to scare me! How is that not a big deal!?” Nell screamed, backed by the fury of all her pent up rage.“Ordered who?” asked Lefi, with a brow raised.“The wraith girls!” she shouted. “I thought he needed me for something, but it turns out that all he wanted to do was have the wraith girls scare me! They popped out of nowhere the moment I turned the corner! Can you believe how terrible he is!?”“Oh man, the way you reacted was just perfect. I laughed my ass off,” said Yuki. “I wasn’t actually sure if you or Lyuu would make the better victim, but now I know I made the right choice.”“H-huh!? Why me!?” squealed Lyuu.“You might be happy about this, but I’m not!” shouted Nell. “You’re terrible!”The only response the demon lord offered was a hearty cackle.***After a bit more squabbling, Yuki escorted the girls to the castle’s courtyard, which had been decorated as one would expect given the holiday being celebrated. Skeletons with pumpkins for heads and gravestones were strewn all over. Adorning them were thick cobwebs, bats, and all sorts of other spooky, scary props.The sky had been altered such that it displayed a permanently overcast sky. Moonlight aside, the only source of illumination that pierced through the thick, dark clouds came from the occasional faint star. Also present was a thick, smokey fog. While there wasn’t so much of it that it was impossible to see in front of oneself, it was still dense enough to disallow one to be aware of much more than was in their immediate surroundings.While the individual set pieces were eerie and off putting, the manner in which they’d been placed and assembled took the emphasis away from their spooky designs and instead made them out to be more eye catchy such that they would appeal more to children than they would have in their original forms.All five of the dungeon’s combat-oriented monsters were present as well. And like the rest of its residents, they’d been geared up with pointy hats, bat wings, and all sorts of other festive equipment. The costumes didn’t exactly work given the inhuman nature of their wearers, but they’d ended up keeping them on regardless at their master’s insistence.“Wow! This is super awesome!” said Illuna, as she walked into the courtyard.“Super awesome!” echoed Shii.“…So extravagant,” said Enne.“These decorations are quite appealing,” said Lefi. “I had anticipated a set more solemn given that you had described the occasion as a banquet for the most sinister of spirits.”Lefi was impressed by the show, but her sense of wonder dulled in comparison to that of the children. All three were looking around with their eyes wide.Unsurprisingly, the dragon had already discarded the pumpkin she had been using as a head, for the sole reason that it irritated her too much for her to want to wear it.“Right?” said Yuki, with a conceited smirk. “It’s totally awesome. I figured the wraith girls would know all about horror, so I had them work through it with me.”The three sisters that he’d mentioned merrily began spinning around him in response to the praise. Unlike usual, they weren’t possessing any sort of dolls, but rather, flew about in their natural, half-translucent, spiritual states.“They really do,” said a defeated Nell. “And they’re especially good at it when they’re up to no good.”“Oh yeah, that reminds me of what happened when you first showed up. They scared you so bad your legs gave out,” said Yuki, with a chuckle. “Man, I sure do miss the good old days…”“I’d rather you forget them.”The hero, who had only just recovered enough to walk, gave the demon lord a reproachful glare.“Anyway, that’s enough reminiscing. Let’s get started on dinner,” said Yuki. “Since we’re in the courtyard, we might as well kick the party off with a barbecue.”“That is a suggestion of which I approve,” said Lefi.“Yay, meat!” said Illuna.“And veggies!” said Shii.“…I like the sauce,” said Enne.“The… sauce?” said Lyuu, in an awkward, questioning tone. “Are you sure y’don’t mean somethin’ else? ‘Cause I’m real sure that the sauce ain’t what most people start cheerin’ ‘bout when it comes to a barbecue.”“I meant the sauce,” said Enne. “The most important part.”“She certainly has a point,” said Leila, with a giggle. “The sauce plays a big part in making everything else taste as good as it does.”And so, amidst all the noise, the dungeon’s residents came together and got to work on a holiday dinner they were all sure to enjoy.<– Prev — Next –>

Playing the Agitator
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerI let Nell off my shoulders, hid her behind me, and stepped forward.“And who are you?” The action led the corpse-to-be to eye me suspiciously.
“That’s a pretty bold claim right there, buddy.” I ignored his question and asked one of my own. “You really think that this is all the hero’s fault?”
“Of course I do! I don’t know what she did to incur their wrath, or why she did it. But one thing’s for sure, she’s the only reason they decided to attack us!” He shouted. “Why else do you think they marched on the city the day she arrived in town? And without any prior warning, at that?”
“So where exactly did you learn that we just got here anyway? We were sitting in a carriage all day, so I doubt anyone’s seen us anywhere. And it wouldn’t really mean anything even if you did. We could’ve been in town for days. Yet, you seem awfully convinced that she just got here.” I smirked. “Is it just me, or is that kinda sketchy? You’re almost making it sound like you’re keeping tabs on her.”He spent a moment in silence before flubbing out an excuse.“I-I saw her get off the carriage! With my own two eyes!”
“You saw us? That’s weird. Because we didn’t get off until we were inside the inn’s stables. I got a pretty good look at everyone around us, and I don’t remember seeing anyone even remotely like you there.”He flinched. He knew he messed up. Like us, he was well aware that we were staying at a location frequented by all sorts of rich and famous people. As such, it was built with anonymity in mind. Seeing into the stable, which was basically just a large, indoor lobby, was effectively impossible.“Oh, and for those of you who are confused, we’re staying at the real fancy place, you know, the one all the nobles go to. An old governor we happen to know recommended it to us,” I elaborated, both to inform those who weren’t in the know, and to rub my victory in the supposed merchant’s face. “It’s got some pretty hefty security. They don’t let just anyone into the establishment, so I highly doubt you could’ve just seen her because you randomly snuck a peek or two. If you saw us get off, then that’d have to make you one of the inn’s staff members, a fellow customer, or some sort of trespasser.”My claim was about half bullshit. I didn’t know how good the inn’s security really was. But it didn’t matter. The public debate we were engaged in wasn’t a true battle of wits. I didn’t have to be right. I just had to sound right.“If either of the first two, then I’m sure we could get one of the other staff members to testify and prove you are who you say you are. Can’t really say much to disprove your point if you’re going to end up going with option three, but our good friends right here, the city’s guards, might end up wanting to have a word or two,” I said. “So? Which are you? One, two, or three?”There was silence.The “merchant” didn’t—couldn’t—answer the question. I had him checkmated. All three of the options I’d presented him ultimately led to dead ends. And he understood that. Still, he couldn’t just stand around and say nothing. The sharp glares that the people around us shot him eventually started to get under his skin. After looking around and confirming that he had no more allies in the crowd, he made one last desperate attempt to redirect the conversation.“S-stop trying to change the topic! This isn’t about me! It’s about the girl!”
“Oh, righhhhht. My bad,” I said. “Alright, you know what? How about this? Let’s just assume Nell really is the reason the monsters showed up and consider the consequences.” I paused to put a hand on my chin and pretend to think before smacking the bottom of my fist against my palm as if to demonstrate that I’d come to a revelation. “Oh, would you look at that! There aren’t any!”
“What…?”The man raised an eyebrow. He didn’t seem to understand why I was challenging him head-on, so I pointed at the scene that lay outside the city’s walls in an over-dramatic manner. The crowd’s eyes followed the tip of my finger and moved away from the “merchant.”To the massive crevice that Nell had used my mana to create.“She made that giant ass chasm. With a single swing.” I spoke in a low growl. “Look at it. Do you really think someone strong enough to do something like that would lose to a bunch of weaklings?” I paused, as if to wait for an answer, but continued to speak before one could come. “I don’t.”
“I-I think he’s right,” said one of the soldiers. “I saw her clear out all the monsters’ cavalry with just one spell!”
“Yeah!” echoed a second.
“I saw it too! There was a huge flash of light, and then they were all gone!” added a third.
“Obliterating monsters is something she does every day. Hell, she could handle a wave like that one in her sleep,” The volume of my voice grew with each word. The pace at which I spoke accelerated as my sentences began to drip with fervour and momentum. “None of this city’s people were hurt. Nor will they ever be. Because she is our beacon, the almighty shepherd that will protect our people and lead us in battle to victory!”My ardour began to infect the people around us. Knights and citizens alike began shouting the words “victory,” “hero,” and “shepherd,” over and over as they cheered.I knew that I’d already more than pulled the crowd over to my side, but I decided to push it even further despite feeling as if I’d already gone a bit too far.“Remember this. Today is the day that a legend walked amongst us. Today is the day that we were saved by the woman who will go down in history as mankind’s finest! And today is the day we celebrate her advent!” I pumped a fist into the sky. “Long live Nell! Long live the hero!”My hand was illuminated only by torchlight. But the people were able to see it well enough. They followed suit, raising their arms and repeating my final statements with impassioned zeal. Oh man. Playing the agitator is pretty goddamn fun. I should do this more.While I was enjoying myself, the hero I had preached about wasn’t. She had at least in part wanted to stop me from going overboard, but gave up halfway. The evidence of her reluctance was plastered all over her face. She half-cringed and half-smiled as she did her best to remain unaffected by my embarrassing declarations.***“Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck fuck! What the fuck was that!?” Kakuza screamed a countless stream of curses as he whipped the horse driving his wagon. “The plans are fucking ruined! And it ain’t even my goddamn fault! I did my part perfectly!”It was the crack of dawn. The sun had only just reached the horizon. The sky was still dark, with only a few faint traces of light could be seen amongst the fading stars.“God damn it! ‘Only slightly stronger than the average soldier,’ my ass! She ain’t even fucking human anymore, not with a spell like that under her belt! I knew nobles were never to be trusted!” He clenched his teeth in rage as the man he was working for came to mind.
“Wow. Those are some pretty interesting claims I hear.” A familiar voice interrupted the driver’s thoughts. “Mind sparing me the details?”Kakuza drew his blade and swung it at his earside—the location from which the voice had come— without a moment’s hesitation. Much to his annoyance, which he expressed with a click of the tongue, Kakuza’s attack hit nothing but thin air.Retaliation came the moment after his attempt at murdering the voice’s owner. A sharp kick to the head sent him flying off his wagon and into the dirt path beneath him. Likewise, his horse also found itself unwillingly repositioned. The force of the blow had startled the poor creature and caused it to run right into a tree. This, in turn, caused Kakuza’s coach to flip on its side, covering him in a cloud of dust.After a fit of hacking and wheezing, the hired hand managed to force his lungs to take in the air they so desperately craved. With his energies revitalized, he pushed himself off the ground and began observing his surroundings. His eyes immediately locked onto the masked assailant who stood just a short distance away from him.“…You’re the guy from earlier,” he said.
“Yeah, and you’re the fake ass merchant,” he said. “Oh, and don’t even try to keep up the act. You gave yourself away the moment you drew on me. Ain’t no merchant’s got reactions like that.”Kakuza recognized him immediately. It was the man that he’d argued against. The masked man had no weapons on him, which led the contracted ne’er do well to assume his foe was likely specialized in unarmed combat.“What do you want?” he spat. “Here for revenge because I mocked that little bride of yours?”“Well, I mean, yeah, sure. You’re not totally wrong. That was more or less on the agenda, but it’s not all I’m here for. You see, I was thinking that we might as well make full use of this opportunity to sit down and have ourselves a nice, long chat,” said the assailant. “So? What were you after? And who’s the shitlord that put you up to it? I heard you say something about him being a noble?”Kakuza remained silent. As any experienced sellsword would, he looked to his blade. The collision had caused it to leave his hands, but that didn’t mean that it was no longer an option. In fact, he knew that picking it back up was his best choice. It was only a few steps away. A short dash would more than put it in reach of his fingertips.I guess I’ll just kill him, thought the secret agent.He was aware that the man under the mask was likely far more capable than him in terms of raw combat prowess. He had described himself as one of the hero’s subordinates, and the quick reactions he had demonstrated prior to the horse wreck had served to evidence that competency was the reason the honorary position had been granted to him. His ability to appear out of thin air also seemed to indicate that he was proficient with magic. That was precisely why Kakuza knew he had a chance.The powerful were often as arrogant as they were strong. Evidence of this claim’s applicability could be seen in the man’s stance. Or rather, the lack thereof. He was acting with no regard for caution whatsoever. And that would be his downfall.“P-please, wait! Don’t kill me! I know that I could have screwed you guys over real bad, but it wasn’t my fault!” With his plan constructed, the agent put on the dumbest, most over exaggerated expression he knew and began flapping his lips in apparent panic. “All I did was give in to temptation! I couldn’t help myself! They showed me way too much cash for me to refuse. Come on man, please. Just let me off the hook. I’ll tell you everything I know. I’ll even name the guy who hired me!”
“Oh, you will? Great. Saves me the trouble of squeezing it out of you.” He crossed his arms and leaned in. “Well? What are you waiting for? Go for it.”
“His name is—”He never finished the sentence. His foe had lowered his guard even further. And Kakuza wasn’t one to miss such an ample opportunity. He broke into a sprint, darted to his blade, kicked it into the air, and caught it by the hilt before charging the hero’s subordinate. He leveraged his momentum to boost the force of the blow and ensure that it would both strike true and create a fatal wound.But again, much to his confusion, he hit nothing to thin air. The other man had vanished without a trace before his very eyes.“What!?”He was shocked, but didn’t waste any time relishing in the emotion. He immediately tried to recover and take up a stance with his blade, but a heavy blow to the spine sent him crashing back into the ground.“Someone sure seems full of energy. Anyway, where were we?” The voice came from behind him. “Right, you were in the middle of telling me about the guy that hired you. So who was it again?”Kakuza tried to push himself off the ground to escape the predicament he was in, but the moment he put strength into his left leg was the moment he started to scream in pain. The sensation of something tearing right through his flesh caused adrenaline to pump through his system, and cold sweat to drip from his pores. While clenching his teeth to endure the pain, he directed his eyes towards the dagger that was its source.The blade had not only impaled him, but also gone all the way through his body and stitched him to the earth. Blood seeped from both ends of the wound at an alarming rate. The ground had already turned red. He knew that he could move his left leg no longer, else risk it losing all function.The spy tried to tighten his grip on his weapon, just in case, but it was propelled from him regardless. A kick to the hand had both loosened his grip and sent his blade flying far out of his reach.“Oops. Sorry! I really wasn’t meaning to be such a klutz.” The man spoke in an overly frivolous tone. He was clearly lying to his face and intentionally doing it so poorly it was almost insulting. “But you just startled me so much I accidentally dropped my dagger! My bad!”
“You bastard! how dare you do this to meargh!?”Another dagger ran its way through Kakuza’s body and pinned his other leg to the ground. The attack, which had come with neither hesitation or remorse, almost seemed to declare its initiator as a fellow psychopath.“Hey, hey, no shouting, okay? You don’t want to scare me into dropping another dagger or three, do you?”
“Shit!” The agent screamed between gasps of pain. “Fuck you! And fuck that stupid bitch of yours! The two of you fucked up everything! She’s a freak, practically inhuman! And you! You’re a fucking scam artist! You had that whole god damn crowd strung along like a set of puppets!”
“Wow, thanks! It’s been a while since I’ve heard such a nice compliment,”
“Fuck you!”Kakuza appeared enraged, but in truth remained calm and collected. He examined his remaining options in order to turn the situation around—or at least escape. His sword was out of the question. The state his legs were in made it impossible for him to reach it. Even if that weren’t the case, the masked assailant was sure to snap his arms the moment he tried.His only choice was to make use of his last resort, to throw a hidden dagger on his person and slit the other man’s throat. Bluffing hadn’t worked the first time, nor was it even applicable in the perilous situation he had found himself stuck in, so he finally opted to drop his facade in its entirety. He reached into his chest pocket, twisted his waist, and attempted to throw the knife as quickly as humanly possible. There was no waste in his movements. Every muscle did only what it needed to and nothing more.“Sorry man, but your turn’s been over.” But not even that had proven successful. “And it’ll never come again.”The masked man had grabbed his arm midswing and used nothing but brute force to bend it a full ninety degrees backwards. Kakuza wanted to scream, but found himself too winded by the pain to manage any more than a quiet gasp, one covered up by the snapping of his bones.“Oof. That one looked like it probably hurt,” he said. “But don’t worry. I happen to have five whole high grade potions on hand. I don’t really feel like wasting them on trash like you, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.” The hero’s subordinate dangled a set of glass bottles in front of the secret agent’s eyes. “Isn’t this just great? Now you can answer all the questions I’ll ever want you to.”After picking up Kakuza’s dagger, the mysterious assailant squatted down right in front of him.“The whole experience is bound to be a masochist’s wet dream.” A sinister smile could be seen from within the mask’s gaps. “I don’t know exactly how much of a masochist you are, but I’m not exactly what I’d call a sadist, or all that keen on getting you off. Hell, I don’t even like gore. So how about we agree to settle this quickly?”The tone in which the words were spoken was laced with such cruelty that Kakuza couldn’t help but tremble in fear.<– Prev — Next –>

Unravelling a Piece of the Conspiracy
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerI returned to the inn soon after extracting all the information I needed. There, I found the old governor, with whom I discussed my findings. It turned out that the “merchant” was in fact a secret agent sent by some noble fuckwad that wanted to see the hero’s seat vacant.He admitted to being responsible for luring the horde and timing the attack such that it would land immediately following our arrival. His method was to smear himself in a putrid substance, enter their homes, and wreak all sorts of havoc. Once he was sure he had their attention, he took a straight line back to town to ensure that they would remain on his trail.His plan was one that was meant to produce a large number of casualties, casualties he could leverage to accuse her of worthlessness. He intended to argue that her presence had little to no impact on the number of soldiers that fell in battle. But, much to his dismay, none of her allies had even been scratched. She had, to his knowledge, single handedly overwhelmed the incoming force and coerced the horde into a retreat. His plans went to shit. The miscalculation drove the entire scheme off course. He had no choice but to drop his meticulously crafted scheme and make up a much flimsier argument on the spot. Serves you right, asshole.The name of the noble behind the plot was apparently Argus Ladorio. His intention was to degrade Nell’s reputation even further in order to ensure she would be dismissed. The agent had not been made privy to the remainder of the plan’s details, but they likely entailed putting a minion on the hero’s pedestal, as doing so would provide Argus a yes-man in a position of power, which would in turn deepen his influence over both the church and the central government.That’s some sketchy shit right there. Alright, total side note, man, I knew coming along was a good idea. Who knows what would’ve happened if Nell was here all by herself. They coulda started pulling all sorts of shit. Not that they haven’t already.Their first attempt at striking her down had failed. But that did not, by any means, guarantee that they were going to stop harassing her. If anything, they were only going to ramp up their efforts.Nell was my polar opposite. While I would only get involved in events that served my own interests, she would act on behalf of countless people whose names and faces remained unknown to her. She was a sweet girl with a good heart. And she deserved much better than to be treated like a tool and used for political gain. And yet, many of the men who ran this country failed to see her as anything beyond a “hero.” They were incapable of recognizing her as the girl who continued to stand firm and do her best at fulfilling her duty despite a severe lack of confidence. They were too blind to understand how desperately she was trying to play the part of her people’s protector. And that angered me. It angered me to the point of bloodlust. You motherfuckers have got balls. I’ll give you that much. But that’ll change. I’ll make sure of it.I had already decided that any who wished to see her crushed for their own convenience would feel my wrath. I would do unto them as they attempted unto her and use everything at my disposal to grind them to bone dust. I’ve already fucked up once back in the demon realm. And I’ve learned from it. This time, I’ll be much more thorough.“Hmmmm…” The old governor raised a hand to his chin as he pondered the information I’d divulged. “And what has become of the agent?”Oh. Right. Almost forgot I was talking to him. The question pulled my head back down from the clouds and refocused me on the conversation at hand.“Honestly? Dunno. He might live if he’s lucky, but I wouldn’t count on it,” I said with a shrug. I mean, I didn’t do toooooo much to him. Just, you know, chopped off all four of his limbs and dumped him in a group of ogres. They might not have eaten him. Might.
“I… won’t ask.” Raylow paused for a moment to allow his expression to switch from an off put grimace to a stern frown. “I highly doubt Argus to be the sole conspirator. I’m almost certain that he is working under a greater power.”
“Really? Why’s that?”
“Rumours of Argus’ nefarious deeds are practically unending. He is widely known as a proficient schemer, but he isn’t anywhere near influential enough to place a mole within an organisation as stable and far reaching as the church.”
“So, logically, that means he’s gotta be working for someone that influential?”
“The way I see it, he most likely is,” said the governor with a nod. “I’ll have someone look into him as soon as we reach the capital. I’m sure we’ll at least be able to find ourselves a fair set of clues. Naturally, I’ll have anything I uncover relayed to you immediately.”
“Great. Thanks, and sorry for all the trouble.”
“No problem,” said Raylow. “Any nasty plot that endangers the hero is one that endangers the rest of humanity. Working with you to resolve it is only natural.” He paused for a moment to clasp his hands in what almost seemed like nervousness. “But there is one thing I must ask you. What are you planning to do once you reach the capital?”That’s a pretty damn good question. My original plan was just to grab Nell’s boss and the king for a quick conversation about her future. I hadn’t originally planned to do much else. Now that I knew about Argus and his friends, however, that had all changed. The first thing on my list was now to uncover and eliminate all hostiles. Talking to people is going to have to wait. Errr… wait a second. I’m stupid. There’s literally nothing stopping me from doing both kinda at the same time, so I guess I might as well do that. Hell, that could work even better.News of Nell’s engagement was sure to serve as high quality bait. I had no doubts that the mastermind would attempt to take advantage of it and use it as an excuse to try to harm her. Hanging around the capital’s probably going to be more than enough to lure our enemies into the open, especially if I start killing my way up the chain of command.“I’m going to end up doing whatever I feel like doing,” I answered, honestly. “And since they’ve already made their first move, I’mma say that means I’m probably going to end up making mine.”
“…Could you please refrain from harming the citizens, if possible?”
“Wasn’t planning to. Having her man going around randomly killing people is only going to hurt Nell’s reputation. I’ll make sure I act with prudence.”The answer led the governor to exhale with visible relief. …So why exactly does he take me for some sort of bloodthirsty maniac? I swear I’m not.“Thank you,” he said. “Pardon the concern, it comes from knowing the extent of your power. It terrifies me to think that we would never be able to stop you should you decide to bring about the tides of the apocalypse and paint Alshir’s streets with its people’s blood.”
“Oh, come on. You’re over exaggerating. There are plenty of things capable of stopping me in my tracks.”If there was one thing I wasn’t, it would be almighty. I was trying my best to ensure that I would eventually grow enough to stand by Lefi’s side, but I wasn’t anywhere near close. Unlike her, I had to practice everyday because I wasn’t exactly what I called capable of wielding a sword. Moreover, my fighting style was roundabout and almost gamey in the sense that it revolved around targeting down my enemies’ weaknesses. I made liberal use of gimmicks and traps in order to catch my foes off guard. Poisonous bogs, stone spike pits, magical bombs, landmines, iron maidens, and many, many other niche items had all become a part of my dungeon master’s tool kit.At first, I had purchased every trap I used, but I eventually learned to make them with magic instead. Though the crafted varieties were much more cost efficient, they weren’t anywhere near as potent. That said, I knew that I could eventually master them so long as I kept at it, as that was exactly what had happened with my water dragon spell. I was sure to one day grow proficient enough to plop down a whole slew of deadly traps right by my target’s feet without breaking a sweat.Even with all the tools at my disposal, I found myself unable to confront all of the Wicked Forest’s beasts. Many were simply too far beyond me. When my pets and I encountered something we couldn’t handle, we would always nope the fuck out and run for our lives. Not even the monsters we thought we were capable of taking down would always behave as expected. The occasional specimen would manage to slip out of our grasps. And that’s exactly why no one’s ever really bothered claiming the place, I guess. It’s just too fucking hostile.Though my pets and I often chose to flee, it wasn’t as if we never pushed ourselves to fight more powerful foes. The safety net provided by our ability to return to the dungeon at a moment’s notice had provided us plenty of opportunities to push our limits as opposed to just safely grinding it out.“I highly doubt that to be the case anywhere outside of the abnormally dangerous woodland you’ve made your home…” said the governor with a sigh.
“Yeah, maybe, but the point is that the world’s a pretty big place. I’m not unstoppable, by any means, and I’m sure there are plenty of people and monsters out there far stronger than me,” I said. “Oh yeah, I’ve been meaning to ask, does this incident change our plans at all? ‘Cause I kinda doubt we’re still going to be able to leave today.”
“It does,” replied the balding feudal lord. “The men need half a day to get everything back in order. It is possible for us to leave in the afternoon, but I’ve postponed our departure to tomorrow morning instead. There’s no sense in arriving in Alshir in the dead of the night. I know that the sun is already out, and that it may be rather hard to sleep in the middle of the day, but I suggest you take this as an opportunity to rest. Powerful as you are, I’m sure that even you likely find yourself exhausted after such a long day.”
“Yeah, good idea. Some shuteye is sounding pretty good right about now.” I glanced around the inn’s lobby as I spoke. “Oh yeah, where’s Nell? Is she already back in the room?”It was still extremely early in the morning, but last night’s incident had left basically everyone awake. All sorts of people were up and about, but Nell didn’t quite seem to be one of them. Many of the governor’s soldiers were present, but the hero herself was nowhere to be seen.“She left to help the city’s guards clean up after the battle. They called it a day once they made a fair bit of progress and dragged her off to a bar. It seemed she wanted to wait for you to finish your investigations before joining them, but was unable to turn down their fervent requests.”
“Yeah, she’s always been the type to cave in under pressure,” I said.I smiled a bit as I imagined her getting dragged off.“I had some of my men go with her to ensure that nothing inappropriate would occur,” said the governor remorsefully. “But I do apologize for not putting a stop to the event altogether. Allowing a group of men to take a woman soon to be wed to a place where she would be put under the influence of alcohol was not my wisest decision.”
“I mean, sure, Nell’s not great when people are being pushy, but she’s not dumb, or the type to fool around. She’s able to say no when it counts. Don’t worry about it,” I chuckled. “So where is this bar anyway?”
“It’ll be the bar near the ramparts. The party that ensued was… wild to say the least, so you should be able to find it without much difficulty. I believe that all you’ll need to do is look for a large group of men passed out in the streets.”
“Alright, thanks. I’mma go pick her up.”I gave the governor a casual wave and walked out the door.<– Prev — Next –>

Resolve
Editor(s): Joker, Speedphoenix“…Looks like the old fart wasn’t kidding when he said it’d be obvious.” I muttered under my breath as I gazed upon the scene laid out before me. It was so disastrous it almost made it seem as if the horde’s attack had succeeded. Soldiers and townspeople alike were strewn all over the streets, as stained and messy as they would have been had they been slain. Wow, uh… just… wow.The few who had awoken only served to make the scenario look worse. The headaches their hangovers resulted in led them to stagger about and groan like zombies. Yeahhhhh, if I didn’t know what was going on here, I probably would’ve thought I’d just walked straight into a horror movie. Or hell. Probably the latter.Alright, that’s bullshit. But only ‘cause of the smell. That shit’s so strong you could probably pick up on it from a mile away. Whatever the case, one thing was obvious. The party that followed the attack was one not soon to be forgotten. Chances were, we were indirectly at fault. The soldiers had most likely ended up with an excess of energy following the enemy raid because they ended up with no part to play. Going all out and partying until they dropped was just their way of emptying their overcharged batteries.I walked down the street paved with the “dead,” taking care not to step on them as I did. Eventually, after a few minutes of careful navigation, I arrived at ground zero, the bar, and peeked inside. “Looks like this is probably the place.”
“Sorry, but we’re closed,” said the bartender. “I’m sure you can see why.”Like me, he was in the middle of navigating around a bunch of pseudo-corpses. Unlike me, he happened to have a broom in hand and was in the midst of cleaning up after the drunkards passed out all around his tavern.“Don’t worry about it. I was just here to pick up a family member anyway,” I said before glancing around the room. “But yeah, you’re right. Looks like getting everything ready again is probably going to be a real pain in the ass.”
“Yeah, well, business is business,” laughed the bartender. “As this shop’s owner, I can’t really say I even mind it.”
“Fair enough.”Now that’s what we call entrepreneurial spirit.After exchanging a few words with the bartender, I started sorting through the corpses strewn around the store for the one I was looking for.“Let’s see… Nell… Nell… Oh, there she is!” I eventually managed to find her passed out in a chair, face-down with her head rested against her arms. Once I reached her, I placed my hands on her shoulders and gave her a couple light shakes.
“Nell. Wake up. It’s time to head back to the inn.”
“Nnmmnnm…” A small groan escaped her lips as she rubbed her eyes and slowly sat up. “Yuki…?”
“Yeah, it’s me. Come on, let’s get out of here. If you want to sleep, you can do it once we get back.”
“Hehehe… Yookeeee.” She giggled drunkenly as she leaned into me and rubbed her face against my chest.Is she half-asleep? Or just drunk? Ehhhh… by the looks of it, probably both.“Damn it, woman, how much did you drink?”
“Hmmm… Lots!” she said. “Shorry we started partying even though you were shtill busshy.”
“Don’t worry about it. You’d need to be half a man to give a shit about something as inconsequential as that.”
“Mhmm… You’re sho nice.”Alright, yeah. She’s definitely still a bit drunk. She’s slurring her words way too much not to be. And that’s on top of all the weird behaviour. I lent her one of my shoulders as I contemplated the state she was in and helped her to her feet.“Yuki.”
“Yeah?”
“Gimme ah wide!”
“Oh, for fucks sake…” I sighed as I crouched and let her onto my back. “Seriously. Just how much did you end up drinking?”
“Loooootsh!” She wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed me to signal that she was secure.Goddamn drunk. I smiled to myself as I stood up and got back to my feet.“You smell really weally good!”
“That’s… embarrassing. How about you keep stuff like that to yourself?”
“No way.”Oh, okay. With Nell on board, I left the bar and started to head back towards the inn.“Hey, Yuki…?” After a few minutes, she broke the silence and began speaking in a quiet voice.
“Yeah?”
“I did a lot of thinking. About what heroes really are. And what it means to be one.”
“Uh huh…”She paused, so I made a noise to urge her to keep speaking.“Being a hero is hard. Really hard. People will start saying really nasty things about you if you show even the slightest bit of weakness. And they’ll try doing bad things to you too. It doesn’t matter what I think. It doesn’t matter how far the rumours are from the truth. None of it matters unless I’m strong enough to go unchallenged. Heroes aren’t allowed to be weak. No matter what.”
“Mhm…”
“But I still want to be this country’s hero. Not for anyone else anymore. But for me. I don’t care how much people end up hating me. Because that doesn’t change the fact that I love this country. And I want to protect it.”
“Really…?” I was appalled. You really still love it? Even though its people are trying to stab you in the back and use you for political gain?
“Mhm! I really do. I love Allysia. And I love you too. Very, very much. I’d be happy to spend the rest of my life with you and live in that big fancy castle of yours. I’d want to stay by your side forever if I could. And share my life with you. But I can’t. I just… can’t.”
“Because you wouldn’t be able to be a hero anymore?”
“Mhm. Giving up on heroism would be like throwing away my dignity. I know I’m barely a hero. And that, as it is, my pride means nothing. But I can’t just give up. Not yet. At the very least, I want to see this country through this time of hardship. I want to stay with it and make sure it stabilizes. And that it won’t need me anymore. Only then will I have fulfilled my duty.”
“Alright.”There was nothing I could say. I knew the value of dignity. And the weight it held on one’s mind.“Yuki…” Her voice trembled with nervous uncertainty.
“Yeah?”
“I know that asking you this is really selfish. But… Can we get married anyway? Even though I can’t live with you or stay by your side?” The question came timidly, cautiously, and almost fearfully.My response was short and sweet.I dropped her.I pulled my arms out from under her and let her fall flat on her ass.“Ouch! That hurt, Yuki! What the heck!”
“You’re a goddamn idiot, you know that?” I spun around to face her—
“Ow!”—and flicked her right on the forehead.“For fuck’s sake. What do you take me for? You think I’m going to let something that inconsequential stop me from claiming you?” I crossed my arms. “Fuck no! I’m a goddamn demon lord. We do and take whatever the fuck we want.”
“Yeah, I guess that is true.”
“I’m sure you’ve heard this plenty of times already, but demon lords are insatiable incarnates of greed. We get the things we want, no matter how many roadblocks we have to take down to do it. And besides, I’m a real man, not some drooling retard with half a nut. I’d never abandon you just ‘cause we can’t live together.”I offered her a hand.“Look, here’s how I see this. It doesn’t matter if we can’t spend that much time together. Hell, it doesn’t even matter if we end up going down separate paths.” I started to speak more slowly and deliberately, both because I wanted to carefully choose my words, and because I felt the need to hide my embarrassment. “Either way, you’re going to end up by my side. Because you do plan to come live with us eventually, right?”Tears welled up in her eyes as she nodded—“I do.”—and took my hand.I tightened my grip on her, pulled her to her feet, and into my arms. After embracing her delicate frame and allowing her a moment to relish in the sensation, I started to speak.“But you know, honestly, I’m not even sure you’d like it all that much. Some of the people I live with are kinda loud, and make for some pretty annoying roommates. Just calling it out ahead of time before you get stuck dealing with it.”
“That’s okay,” she giggled. “I don’t mind. In fact, I think I like it better when there’s always at least a bit of noise.”
“Well, then I guess you’ll fit right in.” I allowed the warm smile on my face to warp into a wide smirk. “But man, you sure are a sly one. Did you really just go out of your way to pretend to be drunk just so you could milk that outta me? Like, seriously, come on, let’s be real. You totally knew exactly what I was going to say, but you went ahead and did the thing anyway, just ‘cause you wanted to hear it.”Her face went from pale to pink, then pink to red in the blink of an eye. She was so red, in fact, that I felt as if she was either about to explode or eject a jet of steam from her ears.“Y-you knew!?” she squeaked.
“Totally. It was obvious. I could tell you were actually drunk when you just woke up, but then you totally sobered up and started putting on a really bad act instead. The part that made it really obvious was the fact that you totally stopped slurring your speech. Might as well have been a dead giveaway.”
“Why couldn’t you at least have pretended not to notice!?” she said after groaning in agony.
“Because I like teasing people. Duh.”
“Really!? That’s why!? I hate you so much, Yuki! You’re a meanie! A bully! And totally evil!”
“Wooooah there! Calm down! I’m pretty sure you shouldn’t be drawing your sword in the middle of the city like that!” I said as I easily avoided her blade. “And is it just me, or are you getting a sense of deja vu? I swear this exact same thing has already happened.”
“Shut up! Evil demon lords like you should just disappear!”
“Mwahahahaha! Too bad for you, hero! But evil can never be destroyed! As long as sentient life continues to exist, so too shall the dark side! True evil can never be banished! Only delayed!” I cackled as I turned tail and began running away from the blushing hero.
“Oh no you don’t! Get back here!”<– Prev — Next –>

Trust is an Asset Earned Over Time
Editor(s): Speedphoenix“What in heaven’s name were the two of you thinking…?” The old governor, who was clearly fed up with all our bullshit, heaved a heavy, disheartened sigh. “I cannot believe I had to rush to the guard station because the hero of all people had been escorted to it…”
“I-I’m really sorry, Governor.” Nell hung her head in shame as she apologized.
“Yeaaaahhhh… My bad. We probably should’ve known better.” Likewise, I averted my gaze to express much the same emotion.
“I understand that the two of you get along incredibly well, and that you very much enjoy cutting loose in each other’s presence.” The first person he addressed was Nell. “But that does not mean you can drop all pretenses. You’re a public figure. The people will judge you based on how you act in their presence.”
“I know… I really shouldn’t have let myself slip up like that. I’ll try not to cause anymore trouble.”The governor nodded in satisfaction, then turned towards me.“As for you, Sir Yuki… I would like to ask you to be more observant. We humans are odd, social creatures, and we very much believe that, while, there is a time and a place for everything, going wild in public is far from acceptable. If you really do want to take Nell as your wife, then it’d be best for you to take some time to reflect on human norms and at least try to imitate them.” He paused for a moment before continuing in a much quieter voice. “…The thought of lecturing a demon lord on our customs almost seems absurd. I can’t say it’s something I’ve ever imagined doing.”
“Uhhhh, sure, I’ll try.” I said, half-heartedly. I was too shocked by his claim to say much else. B-but I was human… I totally get the rules… Or at least I think I do…The status quo was a direct result of the game of tag I played with the holy sword’s master. The guards had ended up interrupting our playtime by forming an enclosure around us. Well, more like just me. But whatever.They treated me like a high-level threat and kept their weapons pointed at me as they cuffed me up and took me away before escorting Nell to the station. Apparently, the arrest had happened as a result of several people spotting us. They immediately reported the situation to the local police force and informed them that the hero was chasing a suspicious-looking degenerate around the city.Not even in their wildest dreams did the observers suspect that Nell, the hero that had only just saved their lives, was at fault, and that her sword had only been drawn as a result of an emotional overload. The guards, who felt the same way, chose to arrest the degenerate because it was simply the most natural thing to do. Alright, so first of all, what do you mean, degenerate!? That’s rude! They don’t even know me!Nell tried to explain the situation once she regained her capacity for rational thought, and she did manage to resolve the misunderstanding. But with that said, they couldn’t just let me go. The rules stated that someone not involved with the incident had to vouch for my identity. Side note, this whole identity thing is really reminding me of how Japan handles situations like these. The police can’t let you go unless they really know who you are, and IDs can be faked pretty easily, so they always end up falling back on talking to someone you know.The identity issue was why we ended up having to ask for the governor. And honestly, I do feel pretty bad for him. We just caused him a whole boatload of trouble over something equally stupid and avoidable. I mean, just look at him. He looks about as tired as he does not happy.Almost as if on queue, the old man heaved a sigh.“But now the guards know your identity.” Rather than lecturing me further, he moved onto a different concern. “Is that going to be a problem? Wasn’t the whole point of it to keep your identity a secret?”
“Nah, it’s fine. I thought about it, and honestly, there isn’t really any point in keeping my face a mystery. That said, I’m still going to be making sure no one finds out I’m a demon lord.” I wasn’t worried about any leaks. I had also already swapped out my stat page for one that stated that I was human.Showing my face to the world was something that I’d known I was going to end up doing from the start. It was unavoidable. I simply couldn’t stay anonymous if I was going to marry someone as important as the hero. That was why I was planning on tearing my mask off eventually anyway. Just… not like this. But oh well, whatever.I knew that my opinion wasn’t exactly all that relevant given the circumstances, but I felt as if I’d made enough of a name for myself already anyway. That is, Wye, the mysterious masked man who worked to resolve the incident plaguing the capital, had earned enough of a reputation to be a topic worth discussing, even without his mask. Especially since he’s gonna marry the hero. Here’s to hoping it’ll actually alleviate some of the pressure they’d otherwise put on her. I mean, it should. Losing the mask has gotta be some decent incentive for them to try to start figuring out who I am, you know, so they can skip the whole chasing random leads step. Tl;dr I’m using myself as a lure. Come on guys, this is some high quality, demon lord tier bait. All you gotta do is bite.“I suppose it’s fine if you intended it. But I do have to ask again. Are you really sure that this is alright? The moment the people uncover the fact that you are a demon lord is the moment they will stop blessing your union and cursing Nell as a fallen hero who betrayed her people. She’ll be extradited from human society and never allowed to return.”
“It’s okay, Sir Raylow,” said Nell. “I’ll just move in with Yuki if that happens.”I had wanted to open my mouth to reassure him, but Nell cut me off before I could.“As a man dedicated to Allysia’s service, I would very much prefer to avoid that eventuality,” he said. “But I guess there’s nothing we can do. I can see you’ve already made up your mind.”
“I have, but I still want to keep being a hero for as long as I can,” she said. “But one day, I’ll go with him. I’ll start living with this dumb, careless, meanie and deal with all his silly pranks.”
“Uhm… Nell, look, I know you’re still mad at me, but replacing a bunch of would-be compliments with insults isn’t really going to get us anywhere.”
“I’m not mad at all,” she huffed. “Unlike you, I’m too mature to hold a grudge.”
“Well, uhm… then why’ve you been digging your elbow into my ribs? Because I’m not really sure if it’s just me, but I’m starting to feel as if there’s a liiiitle bit of a discrepancy between what you’re saying and how you’re acting,” I said in a cautious, non-confrontational tone.
“It’s clearly just your imagination.”Ah, yes. Clearly. Imagination. This is just phantom pain, and I’m just hallucinating. Guess my sense of touch must just be broken or something. Yeah, that. Her assault was executed with such pinpoint accuracy that it somehow managed to worm its way through my defenses and actually hurt. And quite a bit at that.I awkwardly laughed off her shenanigans before turning back to the governor.“Anyway, I’m confident I won’t be found out, and I’ve got no intention of shitting in my own soup, so don’t worry. I’ll have this whole human thing down pat. Hell, I’ll act so human that other humans’ll start copying me just to be more human.”
“…I’m not quite sure I understand what you’re going on about, but are you sure? I’m starting to suspect your confidence may be a bit… unfounded.”
“That just means you’ve finally come to understand him,” said Nell.Wow… And here I was thinking that they’d probably trust me. Is this just ‘cause they only ever see me dick around? Yeah, probably is. I mean, I can’t really say they’re wrong. They’ve got way more than enough evidence to pretty much ace pinning the tail on the donkey. But I swear, it’s not my fault. That’s just how we demon lords are! So how about you guys chill out and cut me some slack?<– Prev — Next –>

Entering the Capital
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Kakuza failed…?”Argus Ladorio knit his brows as he regarded the subordinate that stood before his desk. Though the shocking news certainly had an impact on his expression, it did nothing to warp the fox-like smile that almost seemed to perpetually rest on his gentlemanly face.“I’m terribly sorry sir,” said his minion. “And I apologize that this report is coming as late as it is. None of us were expecting Kakuza of all people to fail, so we hadn’t checked on him until we realized that he was taking far too long to report back.”
“Enough of that.” Argus dismissed the other man’s excuses with a wave of the hand. “Continue on with your report.”
“It appears that he was able to carry out the first of the plan’s two phases. We have found many sources confirming that Sengillia was indeed subject to an attack.”
“He failed during the second phase?” Argus put down his pen and clasped one hand over the other. “That is rather unexpected. Were his words not convincing enough to turn the people against her?”
“It’s exactly as you say, sir. Unfortunately, not one of Sengillia’s residents were harmed in the attack. Every single individual, soldier or civilian, came out utterly unscathed. The hero was able to single-handedly fight off the invasion on her own.”
“If that is true, then I can certainly see why Kakuza’s arguments failed to hold,” said the noble, bewildered. “But is the hero really that powerful? From what I could tell, she seemed much weaker than her predecessor.”
“With all due respect, sir, I think it would be wise not to continue underestimating her potential. Heroes are often granted their positions due to their powerful latent abilities. It may very be possible that hers had only recently awakened,” said the messenger. “But even with that considered, murdering several hundred monsters single handedly seems like a stretch.”
“I suppose that is just how heroes are. But don’t worry, it isn’t a problem. The next trap I’ve set for her is one that will deny her the opportunity to make use of her powers,” said Argus. “So what of Kakuza? Is he alive?”
“No,” said the noble’s subordinate. “But the circumstances surrounding his death are a bit… out of the ordinary.”
“Out of the ordinary?”The man with the fox-like smile raised a brow. The agent reporting to him was one that rarely beat around the bush. The lack of clarity and conciseness clearly indicated that he was about to be made privy to news that he wasn’t going to like.“We found his remains inside of a den of monsters. Its inhabitants had clearly vented their rage on him. He was beaten so brutally we hardly recognized him,” said the minion. “The strangest aspect of it was there were a few much cleaner wounds mixed in with the rest. They were clearly carved into him with a small knife, one too refined to have been made by the likes of ogres.”
“I see…” said the noble. “So in short, you’re telling me that he was crippled by a third party and thrown to the monsters to be disposed of?”
“I believe so. And I do have a piece of what I believe to be related news that you may be interested in.”
“And what exactly might that be?”
“The hero seems to be accompanied by a man claiming to be her fiancé,” replied the noble’s pawn. “His most striking feature is that he wears a mask designed to look much like the face of a jester or clown.”
“A Mask!?” Argus’ smile found itself replaced by a look of shock, only to rectify itself a moment later. “Is this so-called fiancé of her’s the same masked man that suddenly showed up out of nowhere during the prince’s coup?”
“I can’t say for sure if the two are the very same, but it’s highly likely. The Masked Meister worked closely with both the church and the hero during his last advent.”Argus contemplated several possibilities and muttered a few likely conclusions under his breath before raising both his head and his voice.“Are you saying that you suspect that the Masked Meister was Kakuza’s murderer? And that he managed to crack him?”
“I am, sir. We’re still missing too many details to make any real conclusions, but it’d be best to work under the assumption that our identities have been compromised.”
“As annoying as that is, I have to agree. If the hero’s fiancé really is the Masked Meister, then we’ll have to be on our toes. Whatever the case, we can’t let our guards down. Kakuza was one of my most war-fluent men. If even he was killed without a fuss, then we’ll have to assume that every wrong move can potentially come with the consequence of elimination.” Argus paused for a moment to contemplate his options. “Whatever the case, we need more information. Stop attacking the hero. Keep her monitored, but redirect any efforts that would have been used to worsen her position into investigating this so-called fiancé of hers. You’re free to use up to half the men.”
“I’ll get to it right away, sir.”Argus’ servant bowed, turned around, and promptly left the room.The noble’s smile faded as soon as the other man was gone, replaced by an expression equal parts dark and ominous.“This is ridiculous,” he said. “How useless do you have to be to fail at manipulating one dumb girl? And he even let himself get captured and likely interrogated? Ridiculous. The bastard should have just slit his own neck. That would’ve been the far more honorable choice.” After a moment of clenching his teeth in irritation, Argus slowly relaxed.
“But in the end, it doesn’t matter. Your return has come too late, hero. My plans have already been put into action. All that’s left for you now is despair.”A quiet, mocking chuckle resounded through the room as the puppeteer readied himself for the next act of his play.***It’d been a few hours since we left the city. News of Nell’s departure had apparently got out, as an entire crowd was there to see us off. The people cheered and waved as our tiny carriage slowly made its way off into the sunrise. Much to my dismay, the early morning parade ended up being the only eventful thing that happened all day.“Ughh… this sucks. I thought roadtrips were supposed to be fun.” I groaned as I looked between the dreary scenery outside my window and the less-than-entertaining cards scattered out in front of me. “But this is just awful. I’m bored out of my fucking mind.”
“The scenery around the capital tends to get a bit bland,” said Nell. “We won’t see anything but the same few things until we get there.” She placed her cards on the table and revealed her hand. “Full house.”
“Damn it. Two pair,” I said as I flashed her my cards. “You’ve got a pretty good poker face.”
“Well, we have been playing the game every single day for a month,” she said with a smile.I grumbled a few incoherent curses under my breath as I shuffled the deck. Though I appeared disgruntled, I was actually pretty far from it. If anything, I felt relieved. The anger Nell had derived from my shenanigans had finally dissipated. She was no longer prodding me in the chest, and her smile had finally stopped projecting an aura of anger. Man, that was pretty damn terrifying. Shit was scary enough to give any malevolent spirit a run for their money.Her mood had corrected itself overnight, no doubt in part because of my efforts. Thankfully, the suffering I’d exposed myself to had paid off. Specifically, accompanying her on a shopping trip had seemed to solve the issue. It was the first thing we’d done after taking a quick nap, and effectively the only thing we’d spent the day on. Oh man… what a day… I don’t even want to remember it.The experience had reminded me that the female mind was an enigma not meant to be understood by the likes of mere men. Seriously, why is it that all girls seem to like shopping so much? I don’t fucking get it. Like, first of all, this isn’t even Japan. There aren’t even malls to shop in. Secondly, how the hell can they take so much of it? Like, for fucks sake. Do you know how fucking exhausting that shit is? Though, that might’ve just been me ‘cause I was doing shit all night, but still.Nell had dragged me around beyond the brink of exhaustion. I was so tired of the activity that I’d started dying on the inside. And yet, she was still all gung ho and ready for another round. Seriously, what the fuck? I’m not even supposed to be able to get tired. My body literally isn’t capable of it. I guess this just means not even demon lords can match up to girls on shopping sprees. Goddamn.The carriage suddenly began slowing down right before I dealt another hand, so I set the deck aside and stuck my head out the window to investigate. My eyes were greeted with walls, walls that went on and on for as far as the eye could see.“Oh shit! We’re finally here!”The capital was finally in sight. That was also why we had ended up slowing down. The road was no longer as empty as it had been in the middle of nowhere. There were several other carriages ahead of us, and they’d opted for a more laid-back pace.I heard an audible gulp from beside me. Nell, who had also poked her head out the window, had frozen at the sight of the city’s walls. Unlike me, she had been dreading our arrival.“It’ll be okay.” I plopped a hand on her head and ruffled her hair. “I’ll be right here with you, every step of the way. And I’m not the only one that’s got your back. You’ve got plenty of allies here. Everything’ll be alright.”
“…Thanks, Yuki.”With her eyes still fixed on the capital’s ramparts, she slowly, slowly nodded her head.<– Prev — Next –>

A Second Visit to the King’s Castle
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerThe old governor got off his carriage once we arrived at the gates. But not to do any paperwork. That was left for his knights. Instead, he scanned his surroundings before sneaking over to our carriage and speaking to us in a hushed voice. It was an obvious precaution, one taken to ensure that Nell’s arrival was kept a secret.“I will be heading to the castle and visiting His Majesty immediately. Will the two of you be joining me?”Nell seemed to be looking at me and waiting for my opinion, so I answered with a shrug. “Up to you. I’m more or less just tagging along anyway.”
“I do kind of want to go to the church, but it would be best for me to visit the castle first. I need to apologize to the king,” she said.
“There is no need for an apology. I am absolutely certain that his majesty would not mind, even if you did end up causing him trouble,” said the governor. “But if that’s what you wish to do, then I won’t stop you. I know that your coach is not exactly the most comfortable place to be, but I will have to ask you to remain inside it for a little bit longer. We will be arriving at the castle shortly.” After confirming that we were on board, Raylow quickly returned to his own carriage.
“Man… having allies at times like these sure does make everything a lot easier.”
“Mhm.” agreed the hero. “I really can’t thank him enough. He’s done so much for us.”Though I didn’t verbally comment any further, I internally agreed with her. I had always thought that the end of the Illuna incident would mark the last time I ever saw the old governor. And yet, he had somehow ended up becoming one of the few people I found myself associating with time and time again. Hell, I’ll even go as far as to say that, Nell aside, he’s the human I’m closest to.Our coach rolled its way into the city as soon as we were clear to enter. We were immediately hit by a wave of noise. It turned out that, when not in times of desperation, Alshir was just as lively as the capital of the demon realm. Its streets were so densely packed with people that even looking outside was enough to inspire in me a sense of discomfort. The difference between the city’s current state and the state I remembered it in was as clear as night and day. Last time I was here, I coulda sworn this place was basically just a ghost town.I glanced over at Nell, who seemed to be a bit unsettled. She was being a huge wuss and fidgeting about in a mix of what seemed to be nervousness and discomfort. But even so, I knew she carried with her a heavy resolve. I could sense it. It lay beneath her anxiety, but it was certainly there. In the brief time since I’d come to know her, Nell had transformed from a cry baby into someone who truly deserved to be labelled a hero.That was why I chose to say nothing. I simply smiled as I leaned back into my seat and crossed my arms.***Though the capital’s roads were both wide and well-paved, there was too much traffic for us to go at any sort of reasonable speed, so it ended up taking about half an hour for us to get to the ivory castle that lay at the city’s center. Its presence was as striking as ever. There was certainly a sort of beauty in the way it overlooked the rest of the city.After a bit of paperwork at its main gate, we found ourselves within its walls. My last visit consisted of sneaking around and using backdoors to get where I wanted. But this time, I was busting right through the front door. Not that I’m actually busting through anything, but whatever. You get the point.I trusted the king. But I remained on guard regardless. I knew that there were enemies afoot, and that they were actively looking to ruin my day. With that in mind, I pulled a familiar looking mask out of my inventory and equipped it as I stepped out of the coach.“Did you really still intend on wearing that?” asked the governor.
“Yeah, ‘cause I mean the king and I have already had a face to face talk and all, but I never ended up taking this thing off in his presence. So I was kinda thinking that he might not actually recognize me without it.”
“Can you really call it face to face if you never revealed your face?” asked the old man.I mean… kinda, right? I mean, we still did face each other and stuff, so it should? I guess?“I… think it would be best for you to take it off.” His voice carried traces of several different emotions, among which were amusement and reluctance.
“Huh? Why’s that?”My question was, in part, answered immediately, albeit not by the person I’d posed it to.“M-might you be the Masked Meister?”
“The what?”Spinning around presented me with a startled soldier. Unlike many of the castle’s other guards, who seemed older and more experienced, he was young, potentially even younger than me. Errr, wait, no, that can’t be right. I’m like what, a year and two months? Yeah uhhh… yeah. Right.“T-that’s his mask…! I’d recognize it anywhere! Y-you really are him! You’re the mysterious master warrior that saved Alshir!”
“U-uhhh, probably… I guess…?”>Masked Meister.
Wut. I mean, I guess I can kinda see why they ended up settling on it. There weren’t exactly all that many options given how little I’d revealed. But still. The fuck?“W-w-w-wow! I can’t believe this is actually happening! I’ve finally got to meet our saviour! In the flesh! This is like a dream come true!” proclaimed the guard. “C-could I please have your autograph!?”
“Uhhh… sure, I guess?”I found myself taken aback by the soldier’s frantic enthusiasm, so I ended up accidentally accepting both the pen-like utensil and the piece of paper he’d handed me without any further thought. I had no idea what I was supposed to write, so I ended up scribbling down the first thing that came to mind: “Bitch, please. Did you actually think I was going to sign this shit? Hell naw.” In Japanese, of course.“Thank you so much!” said the soldier. “These letters… I don’t recognize them, but they look so powerful, so imposing! Thank you, thank you! I’m definitely making this a family heirloom!”
“I uhhh… probably wouldn’t if I was you.”The soldier appeared not to hear the suggestion I voiced, as he ended up happily parading himself back to his post whilst humming a cheerful tune.“I-is that who I think it is?”
“I-It has to be…”
“It’s the Masked Meister!”The happy-go-lucky man’s shenanigans evidently alerted the other guards of my presence. They too began to flash me looks of admiration and praise as they whispered to their buddies.“Soooo…” I turned to my two companions. “Either of you going to explain what’s going on? ‘Cause it kinda seems like I’m getting a whole shitton of people staring at me right about now.”
“That would be because you’re pretty famous around here,” said Nell. “You’ve become something like an urban legend. Just about everyone’s heard of you.”
“You’ve been the talk of the town,” added Raylow. “And for good reason. You appeared out of nowhere when things were looking their worst and saved not only both remaining members of the royal family, but also the country itself. Rumours about you have been flying around the city ever since. Many of them came from the guards.” He directed his gaze at the men around us for emphasis. “They’ve been going around and telling people that they stood shoulder to shoulder with Alshir’s liberator.”
“There were even a whole bunch of plays that had you as the protagonist,” said Nell with a giggle. “I wonder how they’d feel if they knew you were a demon lord.”
“I know that this is rude of me to say, especially right in front of you, but seeing the posters used to advertise those very stageplays has always left me emotionally exhausted,” said the governor with a dry laugh. “I always end up feeling both a sense of amusement and its exact opposite.”Seriously? And they tell me this now, of all times!? What the fuck!?“So uh… couldn’t you guys have, you know, warned me or something?”
“I did intend to,” said Raylow. “I made an explicit mental note to mention it after seeing you don the mask in Sengillia. But it slipped my mind because you hadn’t been wearing it this morning. For what it’s worth, I do apologize.”
“Sorry,” said Nell. “It’s been a while since I’ve been here, so I totally forgot.”
“…Alright, fine, whatever. Let’s just get moving. I don’t really want to just hang around for too much longer, ‘cause it looks like it’ll probably just end up being a huge pain in the ass to deal with.”
“I agree. Follow me, I’ll lead the two of you the room His Majesty will be seeing us in immediately,” said the governor.
“Wait, we’re seeing him already? Didn’t we just get here? I was expecting to have to wait for at least an hour.”
“After learning that the three of us were present, his majesty decided that meeting with us took precedence over the task he had at hand. Audiences with Nell and I are considered rather high priority, and I’m sure he thinks the same of you as well,” said the governor. “Now let us hurry on. It wouldn’t be right for us to keep a man as important as him waiting for long.”***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey there, guys… Joker here. Sorry, I’m a bit out of it. My dad has been having shortness of breath and a vastly elevated heartrate, around 200 BPM, and has been admitted to the hospital. Can’t say much else, but they want to put a balloon pump in his leg, so he’s being transferred to the major medical area in my city. Please, just keep him in your thoughts for us, all right? See y’all in the next chapter…<– Prev — Next –>

A Reunion with an Overworked Monarch
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerThe old governor led us through the castle. We waltzed through the hallways and made several twists and turns before arriving at a familiar looking door. I’m pretty sure this is where me and the king had that face to face thing I was talking about.Raylow was clearly familiar with the whole audience thing, as he opened the door immediately after knocking on it instead of waiting on some sort of response. He then held it open and ushered Nell inside by playing the ladies first card. I spotted a pair of familiar faces from over the shoulders of my two companions. One was, obviously, the king we had arranged to meet. The other was his daughter.“Nell!” Both royals had started atop a couch, but the tiny princess’ energy levels didn’t allow her to stay put. She rocketed towards the hero and gave her a big hug the moment she noticed her walk through the door.“It’s nice to see you again too, Iryll,” said the hero.
“I was really, really worried! I thought something awful might’ve happened to you!” pouted the princess. “No more suddenly disappearing like that anymore, okay?”
“I’m sorry, my lady,” said Nell with a giggle. “I’ll do my best to stay in touch from now on.” She paused for a moment to smile before speaking in a more teasing tone. “I’ve brought you something really special to make it up to you.”
“You have? What is it?”Nell took a step forward to free up the doorway as she spun around and directed the princess’ gaze to the person standing behind her: me. The tiny little maiden’s eyes slowly rose from eye level and moved up my body, stopping only once her eyes reached my own.“Hey, long time no see.” I casually waved at her as I spoke.What followed was a series of easy to read reactions. At first, she stood frozen with her eyes opened as wide as possible. After a few seconds, she finally defrosted herself, but that didn’t mean she was any less flustered. She immediately looked down at her own dress to verify whether or not she thought herself presentable. Apparently, the answer she arrived at was a no, as she fidgeted around with a few bits of it in panic before finally settling down.“I-it’s very nice to she—!” She stuttered out about half a nervous greeting before closing her jaws on her own tongue.Oof. That’s gotta hurt.“I mean see! It’s very nice to see you again, Mr. Demon Lord!” She almost seemed to brush off the pain that accompanied the action, as she continued to rattle on excitedly. “I was waiting for you ever since you left!”
“Yeah, nice to see you again too, princess.”I ruffled her hair, which prompted her to close her eyes and prop herself against my hand in a cat-like manner. There we go. Looks like she’s finally calming down.Once I made sure the petite monarch was sated, at least temporarily, I turned to her father, who had remained situated on the sofa with his haggard old face twisted into a gentle smile.“Hey there, kingpin,” I said. “Haven’t seen you in a while either.”
“It certainly has been quite some time since we last met,” he said.
“Pretty much, yeah.” I paused for a moment to grimace. “I was thinking of commenting on how well you’re doing, but that’d probably be a bit too much of a stretch, by the looks of it.”Allysia’s ruler had clearly been subject to a copious amount of undue stress. Like the governor, he was so exhausted he radiated an aura of fatigue.“The past few months have been hard on me.” He chuckled in a self-mocking manner. “Ruling a country is, unfortunately, far more demanding than I would like it to be.”I didn’t know all that much about the way his country was structured, but I at least knew enough to deduce the root cause of the king’s problems. The way I saw it, it all stemmed from his personality. My opinion of him was that he was kind, almost overly so. In other words, he was too much of a nice guy. And in noble society, nice guys really did finish last. Most of the dirty schemers that thrived in society’s upper echelon were brutal opportunists. They would take full advantage of every bit of kindness they could—even if that kindness happened to stem from the country’s supposed top dog. RIP king. Dude’s probably been getting played like a fiddle. But man, everything everyone’s been telling about high society has made it sound hella awful. And definitely not for softies.Our conversation hit a bit of lull, so Nell took the opportunity to step forward and take a knee, as any good knight would.“I am terribly sorry for all the trouble my absence has created, Your Majesty. It fills me with shame to know that my selfish decisions have only served to worsen the weight on your shoulders.”
“If anything, it should be I who is apologizing to you,” said the king. “You have done nothing wrong. But I’ve clearly failed to keep a grip on my men’s reins. I’ve allowed them not only to make a mountain out of a molehill, but also bring it into the public eye right under my very own nose.”
“T-there’s no need to blame yourself, Your Majesty! The fault doesn’t lie with you! The speaking you’ve done on my behalf in my absence is the only reason that the situation has not completely spiralled out of control!”Nell shook her head in vehement, flustered denial, but it failed to persuade the monarch; he continued to speak in a self-deprecating tone. “All the speaking I’ve done has amounted to nothing but proof of my own powerlessness. None of this would have happened to begin with if my words carried any true weight.” He paused for a moment. “But whatever the case, let us set this topic aside for now. To me, what matters most is that you’ve returned in one piece.” Again, he paused. This time, he took the brief moment of silence to redirect his gaze at his oldest visitor. “Sir Raylow, thank you. You’ve done me a great service by bringing the two of them here.”
“Thank you very much, Your Majesty. I am undeserving of words so kind.”The governor placed a hand on his chest and bowed reverently.Finally, after addressing the other two, the sovereign once again turned to face me.“So, Yuki? To what do I owe the pleasure today?” he asked before speaking his next words alongside a heavy sigh. “Has another group of imbeciles attempted to infiltrate the Wicked Forest…?”
“Oh, nah, I wasn’t dropping by for anything like that this time,” I said. “I’m mostly just here ‘cause Nell is.”
“I’m not sure I follow.”
“Well, long story short, I’m basically here to tell you that she and I are getting married.”
“…You’re what?”The bomb I casually dropped was met with a series of confused monarch sounds. His entire body had frozen, his half-open mouth included. Wow, that’s some deja vu right there. I could swear the governor reacted the exact same way.“Whaaaat! That’s not fair! I’m so jealous” complained Iryll. “I wanted to marry Mr. Demon Lord too!”
“Errr… uh… how about we save that for when you finish growing up?” I attempted to ward off the question without hurting her feelings.
“Okay! But that better be a promise!”
“Errr… sure… I guess.”…Welp. I’m fucked. I mean, I’ve postponed the problem, but I’m still fucked. Guess the only hope I’ve got left now is for her to forget about this whole thing. ‘Cause yeah. Fuck.I grimaced in regret as I once again ruffled the petite princess’s hair. …Please forget.“I… I feel as if I am not understanding something,” said the king. “I am beginning to suspect that I simply may not have heard you correctly. Did you just state that the two of you have decided to wed? Despite one being a demon lord, and the other a hero?”
“Yeah, basically. I mean, I could explain, but that’d make for a bit too long of a story. So yeah, in brief, shit happened and she’s mine now,” I said. “And I know that her being a hero makes this less convenient than it would’ve been otherwise, and that it’s probably going to cause you at least a few problems down the line, so I figured I might as well drop by and tell you in person.”After taking a few more moments to digest my words, the king finally spoke.“…Does that mean that Nell is going to be retiring?”
“Last I heard, she was still going through with it.” I said, as I turned to the girl in question.
“I would love to continue serving this country if you would allow it, Your Majesty,” she said. “The only real change is that, from now on, I’ll always have him in my heart.”
“Look at that. If that’s not smitten, I don’t know what is,” I said with a smirk. “You see, kingpin, become a demon lord like me, and you can easily seduce as many heroes as you’d like too.”
“…Shush, you dummy.”Nell began to blush as she drilled her elbow into my side. Again.“You’re so lucky, Nell…” said the princess, enviously. “I wish I could be like you! I want to be on really good terms with him too.”
“I’m sure you will be, one day. He did just promise to marry you once you get older, after all,” said the hero.
“Will I really…? Is that true, Mr. Demon Lord? Will we be as close as you and Nell are right now when we get married?
“U-uhhh yeah, sure.” I said before glaring at the hero indignantly. “…Nell, stop that. You’re digging me a goddamn grave.”
“You mean the grave you’ve already dug yourself?” She shrugged in a way that almost seemed familiar as she flashed me a charming smile.Zzzzzz… I clicked my tongue. God damn it. It looks like all the dungeon’s other residents have rubbed off on her. She’s gotten way better at comebacks. And she doesn’t really back down anymore. Damn it!“I was caught off guard at first, but if that is what the two of you truly wish for, then I would be more than glad to give you my blessings,” said the king, sincerely. “Congratulations, both of you. I’m sure that there are many high hurdles for you to cross given the nature of your relationship, but I know that the two of you will be able to overcome them.”
“Thank you very much, Your Majesty!” pepped Nell.
“Thanks. Being personally approved by the guy in charge is sure to make this whole process way less painful.” I paused to momentarily direct my eyes at the princess. “By the way, I kinda wanted to talk about something.”The king understood the gesture immediately.“Iryll, it’s about time for you to get back to your studies.” He turned towards his daughter and spoke a line she most certainly did not want to hear.
“Awww… but I haven’t seen either Nell or Mr. Demon Lord in forever! I wanted to spend some more time with them…”
“As they have just arrived today, I suspect that they’ll be in the capital for quite some time.” He looked at me for confirmation.
“Yeah, we’re planning to stick around for a good bit. We’re not going to be in the capital the whole time, but we’ll definitely be in the general area.”
“See? You’re sure to have plenty of chances to play with them later.”The tiny royal frowned and hesitated. But after a few moments of deliberation, she seemed to realize that we were probably busy and prioritized our intentions.“Okay…” She looked up at me, anxiously. “But only if you promise to play with me later. I’ll be really mad if either of you disappears without at least saying goodbye!”
“Sure,” I said. “We’ll make sure we say something before we leave.”
“Don’t you worry, Iryll. We won’t be disappearing anytime soon,” said Nell. “In fact, why don’t we spend some time together tomorrow?”
“Really!? Yay! Okay! I’m just dying to know how the two of you fell in love! Can you promise to tell me all about it?”
“U-uhhm… O-okay,” stuttered the hero, red faced. “But I doubt it’ll be all that interesting…”
“I’m sure it will be! I can’t wait!”The princess bowed in a well-mannered fashion and left the room, a big smile on her face all the while. Once the door closed behind her, the king, who had watched her go, prompted me to continue.“So? What was it that you wanted to discuss?”<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Supposed Successor — Part 1
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerWith his prompt as my cue, I divulged everything I’d learned to the king by recounting my experiences with Argus’ secret agent.“I was told that Sengillia had been attacked and that Nell was responsible for repelling the incoming force, but I was not made aware that such a scheme had taken place behind the scenes,” said the king, after digesting the information.
“Yeah, shit was messy,” I said. “You got any ideas as to who the asshole backing that Argus douche might be?”Allysia’s monarch sank into thought and spent a good few moments contemplating the possibilities. But in the end, he shook his head from side to side.“Unfortunately, the mastermind’s identity is not something I am able to determine with the information we possess on hand,” he said. “Argus is a cunning man. He is quick to switch between factions and often shifts his stance the moment the winds turn sour. He has never truly worked under any specific individual for long enough for me to deduce his true loyalties.” With a sigh, he turned towards the governor. “Might you have any ideas, Sir Raylow?”
“Unfortunately not, my liege. I gave the matter quite some thought, but ultimately reached the same conclusion,” he said with a weary, apologetic sigh.
“So which faction is the slimy bastard in right now?” I asked.
“He appears affiliated with several,” replied the king. “The one he has the closest ties to, at this precise point in time, is led by one Duchess Emeralda Flowlight, a distant relative of mine.”
“And you don’t think that this Emeralda chick is behind this whole thing?”
“I do not,” he replied firmly. “For the duchess is well… a woman.”I was confused, at first. But then his words sank in. I immediately came to realize that powerful women, like Nell and her boss, were exceptions. Like many of Earth’s older monarchies, Allysia’s was one in which politics remained male-centric. Women were oppressed, regardless of position, and did not truly make it onto the political stage. They remained observers, save for when they expressed their opinions to their male counterparts. The rule applied even to high ranking nobles, like the duchess in question. And it was for that reason she was excluded from suspicion.“Any scheme that seeks to harm Lady Nell is one devised by a traitor amongst our ranks, one willing to sacrifice Allysia’s well being for his own gain.” The governor turned to the king and began to speak as I remained lost in thought. “As such, your majesty, I would like to assist both our hero and her fiancé in this endeavour. My men have already begun working to track down the mastermind.”
“…Thank you, Sir Raylow. I know I can always count on you to stand by my side when it counts.”
“I would have it no other way, my liege. We understand that you are desperately fighting to make this country a better place for us all. Working to resolve an issue in your court, especially at a time like this, is merely my duty. As one of the citizens that has benefited so much from your benevolence, and a human being, it is something I must do,” said Alfyro’s lord. “Of course, not all of our co-conspirators, in this case, may feel that exact way. Some of us present may not exactly be human, after all.” He threw me a grin before breaking into a laugh.Hey man, I know I’m not human, but I’m at least humanoid. No need to call me out like that. I totally fit in!“It is as you say. Likewise, it is only natural for us to also cooperate with Nell, who stands at this conflict’s front line,” said the king. “I will also be doing a bit of prodding, but not extensively. I will entrust all in-depth investigation to you, Sir Raylow.”
“By your will.”
“Thanks guys,” I said. “This helps. Lots. But just FYI, I’m going to be doing things my own way. I won’t hurt anyone that isn’t involved but can’t really say the same for the people that are. Hope that doesn’t cause you too much trouble.”
“Please, by all means, do whatever you’d like,” said the king. “But I must say, I do feel sorry for Argus. The poor baron has most certainly incurred the wrong man’s wrath.” He chuckled as he condemned the slimeball I was after to an early death.
“Wait, so you’re not going to try and stop me?” I raised a brow. “Huh. Wasn’t expecting that.”
“I don’t see any point in trying. The only person even remotely capable of such a feat would be the fine lady you’ve decided to wed.”Wouldja look at that! He totally gets it! I didn’t even have to explain!“Don’t you worry, Your Majesty! I’ll make sure to keep a good grip on Yuki’s reins so he doesn’t end up spiraling out of control!”
“Very well. If you are confident you will be able to see it through, then that duty will be yours,” said the king.
“What do you mean, reins? Am I supposed to be a horse or something?”
“Mhm! That’s exactly what I was trying to say. You’re a wild stallion filled to the brim with lust. You go crazy whenever there are women around, and even crazier if they’re underaged!”I raised my arms and half opened my mouth, as if to say “What the fuck!?” without actually vocalizing the words. Nell evidently found this action amusing, as seeing it prompted her to begin giggling uncontrollably.***After we finished discussing the Nell situation and our plans for the immediate future, we went on to talk a bit about politics, economics, and other issues plaguing the country in broader terms. None of it seemed particularly relevant to Nell or I, so we ended up stepping out and leaving the two older men to their business.“Alright, so it looks like we’ve secured ourselves a place to stay while we’re in town, but I still think there are a few things on the agenda,” I said. “Did you still feel like stopping by the church today?”The place that we were going to be staying referred to the castle. The king had been nice enough to lend us a guest room for the duration of our visit.“I know it’s starting to get a bit late, but I really should. Staying away for a whole month is sure to have caused them plenty of trouble. You don’t have to come with me if you don’t want to.”
“When did I ever say anything about not wanting to tag along? If you’re going, then I am too.”
“…Then let’s go.” A cheerful, content smile flickered onto Nell’s face.Side by side, we navigated our way back through the castle. We walked under its brilliant chandeliers and down its grand hallways as we retraced the steps we’d taken to arrive at the meeting room. Upon turning one particular corner, we found ourselves greeted by another pair of individuals, one of which I happened to recognize. The familiar face belonged to one of the humans I’d met in the demon realm, the sorceress that had stood by Nell’s side. The other, less familiar individual seemed much more self-important. The armour he was wearing, which was frankly too fancy for its own good, immediately made me think of him as some sort of douchey frat boy when partnered with the manner in which he conducted himself.“That’s a face I was not expecting to see,” said Mr. Fancypants. “Weren’t you supposed to be dea—”He spoke in a bit of a high-handed, condescending manner, but was unable to finish before a louder voice cut him short.“Nell!” The court mage ran right up to the hero with such vigour that it seemed as if she was going to tackle her, stopping only to avoid a collision.
“Ronia!” Likewise, Nell also exclaimed the other girl’s name, clearly also glad to see her.
“The flow of your magical energy… seems normal. And you don’t have any obvious wounds. Are you really okay? Does it hurt anywhere? I’ve gotten even better with healing magic, and I can fix most things now, so let me know if you need anything, okay?”Ronia rambled on and on as she touched Nell all over and carefully inspected her for any signs of harm.“I-I’m fine, Ronia. I’m sorry I made you worry.”Evidently, the hero was overwhelmed by her friend’s concern, as she ended up on a back foot with a bit of an awkward smile. It was a reaction I totally understood. My impression of the sorceress was that she was the quiet type, so seeing her in such a fluster was quite jarring, to say the least. But that wasn’t to say her seemingly extraneous vigour was unjustified. It served as a demonstration of their bond, the extent to which she had been concerned for Nell’s well being. So uhh… this is actually making me feel kinda guilty. I probably should’ve had her stop by a bit earlier instead of keeping her cooped up for a whole month.“It looks like you really are okay…” Ronia breathed a sigh of relief after finally completing her inspection, after which she immediately turned towards me and bowed. “Thank you very much. For saving my dear friend’s life.”The display seemed to tug at Nell’s heartstrings, as the hero teared up whilst speaking the mage’s name. Likewise, I also found myself smiling to see that she cared so much about the newest member of my family, but as I wasn’t all that keen on necessarily expressing that sentiment, I ended up returning the bow with a shrug.“Hey, don’t worry about it, it was nothing. Nell’s, you know, kinda important to me too, so I was going to end up doing it anyway,” I said. “Oh yeah, speaking of shit that went down back there, how’d things end up turning out on your end? I know Nell was keeping the people hunting you busy, but you guys seemed like you probably still had it pretty rough. Transporting a bunch of noncombatants isn’t exactly what I’d call a walk in the park.”The mage had been working with the other member of Nell’s party to transport a whole slew of wingbearers. I remembered that their ranks included women, children, and wounded warriors. There were still a few with a good bit of fight in them, but all in all, there was much more cargo than there was anything else. Getting all of them to safety was sure to have been a much more difficult task than it seemed.“There were no major roadblocks. Nell bought us enough time to call for backup and get to safety.”
“I guess that means that pushing my limits turned out to be worth it after all.”The hero smiled, for a moment, but the expression was immediately wiped clean off her face.“Still, you shouldn’t have,” said the mage, angrily. “You should’ve just acted like the coward you are and kept yourself safe instead. Reflect on your choices.”
“B-but I already apologized, didn’t I!?” stuttered a flustered Nell. “B-besides, if no one stopped to slow them down, then none of us would’ve made it out alive. Someone had to do it, and I was best suited for the job, so I think I made the right choice…”
“I don’t care. Reflect. Now,” demanded Ronia, unreasonably.
“U-uhm… okay…”With no other choice left to her, Nell smiled wryly as she backed down in the face of her friend’s wrath. Their discussion was one I found entertaining, so I ended up laughing along heartily before reinjecting myself into the conversation.“Man, you two are a goddamn riot,” I said, with one last chuckle. “Anyway, I’m sure you’ve still got lots to talk about, but it’s getting a bit late, and we’ve go—”
“STOP IGNORING ME!!”Nell, Ronia, and I all turned in the shout’s direction, and in doing so, caught sight of Mr. Fancypants with his face red and twisted in anger. He was so pissed that the veins in his forehead bulged as his body trembled with rage. Oh yeah, he exists. Riiiiiight…“So who the hell are you, anyway?” I asked, not out of malice, but because I really didn’t know who he was or why he was here to begin with.“Y-you don’t know who I am!? You insolent hillbilly! How dare you!” he shouted. “And it should be me asking you that question! Who are you, and why are you wearing that suspicious mask!?”Huh? Oh, yeah, right. Almost forgot I was wearing my mask.…Wait a second. How the hell does Little Miss Mage over there know that I’m the guy that showed up in the demon realm? The way she segwayed into the topic was so natural and casual I didn’t even realize she recognized me. Hmmm… Oh well, whatever, fuck it. I’ve already decided that it doesn’t matter if people figure out who I am, so I’m not even going to bother thinking about it.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Supposed Successor — Part 2
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“Who am I?” I repeated the question. “You know, I’m not actually all that sure how I want to answer that.” I turned towards the hero and the mage for a quick, not-so-secretive consultation. “How do you girls think I’m supposed to be introducing myself? I can either do my actual name, or an alias, and I’m not actually sure which is better.” I communicated the inquiry in a voice that was obviously loud enough for Mr. Fancypants to hear.As far as the average Allysian was concerned, my name was Wye, and I served as the hero’s mysterious companion. But my face had already been revealed to Sengillia’s guards, and therefore the world at large. I wasn’t all that sure if there was even a purpose in hiding my identity for much longer. Moreover, I was not exactly keen on getting married under a pseudonym. The idea just didn’t sit right with me.“Oh, uhm, hmm… that’s a good question,” said Nell. “I think you might as well go with your real name since there are already people who know what you look like.”
“That’s a bad idea,” countered Ronia. “If you’re going to give him a name, use an alias.”
“Why’s that?” asked the hero, wide-eyed.
“Anyone you feel strongly about should reveal as little about themselves as possible,” she replied, matter-of-factly. “It’s best for him to keep using an alias until the very end. No matter what you two end up choosing to do. Anything your enemies learn can be used against you. So it’s best to tell them as little as possible.”
“H-how did you know how I felt about him!?” squeaked Nell.
“You’re bad at hiding your feelings. As your friend, it’s easy for me to tell exactly what you’re thinking.”
“I see…” I said as I took in her explanation. “Alright, well in that case, I’ll go ahead and just stick with my alias, since it seems more logically sound,” I concluded our impromptu discussion and turned back face Mr. Fancypants. “Who am I? I’m Wye, the hero’s mysterious subordinate.”
“Did you not just declare that a pseudonym!? What do you take me for!?” retorted Mr. Fancypants, emotionally. “What immature nonsense! I cannot see why any hero would associate with, let alone travel alongside the likes of you.”I ignored his ranting and took the opportunity to analyze him and learn a bit about his identity.***
Name: Manuel Klauser
Race: Human
Class: Intermediate-Level Knight
Level: 25
***His stats generally sat between 300 and 350, which meant that each of his fundamental stats was about three times that of the average adult human being. His skills were nothing out of the ordinary given his class, and mainly consisted of things knights seemed like they would like using, such as Sword Mastery and Shield Mastery. All in all, he was pretty strong, for a human, and certainly seemed like someone that most others would consider competent.“So? What do you want, Manny?” I crossed my arms. “We’ve kinda got shit to do, so we’re not sticking around unless it’s important.”
“So you do know who I am!” exclaimed Manuel. “If you know who I am, then why did you bother pretending otherwise!? Your actions make no sense!” After shouting his heart out, Mr. Fancypants cleared his throat to shift topics before continuing in a more irritating tone. “Hmph. I can certainly see why so many have lost confidence in the hero if she keeps such ludicrous men in her company. But I suppose that was not something that could be helped. There is no way a mere commoner, let alone a young girl, could possibly live up to the role’s expectations! Our leadership’s inability to understand that is why this country has been left in such a broken state.”His rant was so accusatory and ridiculous that it caused Magegirl to puff up in anger. And yet, he continued.“Everything that has happened stems from her lack of power! Compared to her predecessor, who was both charismatic and almighty, she’s nothing but an eyesore! She needs to ste—!”Ronia stepped forward to express her indignation and fight his words off with her own.But I took action before her.I rushed forward, grabbed the bastard by the face, and lifted him into the air with one arm.“You got some balls, dissing Nell in front of me like that.”I spoke in a low hiss as I began to apply force. I was holding back. I didn’t intend on killing him just yet, but my digits slowly began sinking into his skull regardless.“Argghhh!?” He screamed in pain as his bones creaked under the force of my grip. “Y-you dare use force on me!? You won’t be getting off easy for this!”
“I don’t fucking care.”
“D-do you know what you’re doing!? My father is a duke! And I’m his second son! For a commoner like you, the act of attacking a noble is more than enough reason for you to lose your he—”
“I. Don’t. Fucking. Care.”I casually threw him into a nearby wall after the words left my mouth. The impact was accompanied by a pained groan, after which he collapsed with his back against the wall.After walking over, I squatted down right in front of him so we saw eye to eye. “I don’t care how important you are. I don’t care who your father is, or who he knows,” I spoke in a low, threatening growl. Each of my words came out slowly, heavily laced with venom. “And since you seem to be having some trouble understanding me, I’ll lay it out for you, nice and simple. I do two things, keep my allies safe and destroy my enemies. And so, as someone that’s decided to talk shit about my fiancée, I’m going to have to ask you this: are you one of my enemies?”His face paled. He scampered away from me and to his feet before turning tail and running down the hall whilst screaming the type of line one would normally expect to hear from a small-time criminal. “You’ll regret doing this! I swear it!”While I did keep my eyes glued on his back, I didn’t bother chasing him. Instead, I took my sweet time standing back up, half in confusion.“The hell? Why’s he just running off? Wasn’t he literally just trying to pick a fight?”
“You know, after seeing that, I think I’m starting to feel bad for him,” said Nell, with a dry laugh. “And now that I think about it, I’ve come to realize that you’re really good at scaring people and shaking them down.”
“Wow, rude. You’re making it sound like I’m some sort of punk,” I said. “I mean, it works, right? Hell, I’d even say it’s pretty efficient. You can avoid a lot of problems if you just freak out the right people.”As much as I didn’t want to acknowledge it, I knew that I had gotten fairly good at the art of intimidation, but not intentionally. The events that had transpired since I turned into a demon lord just so happened to coincidentally grant me with plenty of experience. Man… I’ve been doing some pretty nasty things, huh? ‘Cause I’m pretty sure that making people shit their pants is the kind of skill honest people generally tend to do without. Oops…“Well, I’m sorry, but it’s just an honest observation,” She smiled at me teasingly. “But thanks, Yuki. Thanks for getting so mad for me.”
“It was nothin’.”
“…Fiancée?” Ronia muttered the term suspiciously as she repeatedly switched between staring at the two of us.
“Oh, uhm… Mhm…” Nell fidgeted around before bashfully nodding. “We’re getting married. It’s not official yet, but that’s why he’s here with me. We’re talking to everybody about it and sorting through all the formalities.”
“Oh…” The mage frowned for the briefest of moments, seemingly disappointed, but soon switched to the less-than-expressive expression she usually wore. “I guess that means you’ll be retiring. It’s going to be lonely around here without you. But if you’re happy, I am too.”
“Huh? Retiring? I’m not retiring,” said Nell. “I’m still going to be keeping at it and doing my part.”
“…Are you serious?”
“W-why wouldn’t I be…?”
“Nell…” The mage sighed before looking my way sympathetically. “I’m sorry about her. She’s not usually this stubborn. But she gets this way sometimes. I don’t know why either.”
“Ehhhh… I mean, I kinda figured this would be how things played out with her being her, so it’s not like I don’t know what I’m getting into.”
“W-what the heck, you two!? Why are you making it sound like I’m the odd one out?” Nell seemed completely taken aback by the difference between our opinion and hers.
“You know, Nell, I’ve always thought you were a bit of a weirdo,” said Magegirl.
“You’re one of the last people I’d ever want to hear that from!”I chuckled a bit before shifting gears.“So what were you doing with that retard anyway? You two don’t exactly seem like the type to mesh.”All the insults Mr. Fancypants had fired in Nell’s direction had clearly gotten the sorceress’ blood boiling. The glare she had given him was one that contained no shortage of bloodlust, and was the type one would never give a friend.“It was for work…” she mumbled. “I was ordered to teach him magic. And I couldn’t refuse. Because I’m one of the court’s mages, and his father is a duke.”
“Eughh… Sounds like a pretty shit job.”
“Ronia’s one of our best mages, so all sorts of people come to her for instruction.”
“Yeaahhh, Iunno about you, but to me, that just sounds like a huge pain in the ass. ‘Cause by the sounds of it, you’ve probably gotta deal with stuck-up assholes like Mr. Fancypants pretty much all the time.”
“Unfortunately, you’re right. There are so many of them it drives me insane. It doesn’t make sense for me to waste my precious time on idiots like him. I’d never even look at him twice if not for work.”The changes in the mage’s expression were normally rather diminutive. But not this time. She was clearly way more than fed up with all the shit she had to put up with. That… sounds stressful. And not the type of job someone so young would be happy to be stuck with. She must’ve been through a lot. Man, I’m glad I reincarnated as a demon lord. Not having to give a fuck about society or its rules is a godsend.My new position in life came with the downside of having to deal with everything that came my way myself. There were no social programs or safety nets to support me. But I didn’t mind. I preferred freedom over any of the downsides I’d ended up experiencing. You hear that, kids? Becoming a demon lord is something you *should* try at home.“We’ve been talking for a long time,” said Ronia. “Didn’t you two need to get somewhere?”
“Oh yeah! We do!” exclaimed Nell. “We can talk more tomorrow, the day after, or whenever you happen to have time. We’ll be staying in the castle, so it should be pretty easy for you to find us.”
“Yeah, do stop by,” I added. “You’re pretty fun to have around, and I’d totally love to hear all about the more embarrassing parts of Nell’s past.”
“Tough luck, that’s not happening, right, Ronia?”
“Yup. Tough luck. I’m telling him everything I know.”
“P-please don’t!”And with that, we said our goodbyes and parted ways with Magegirl. Oh man, that was a riot. She’s a fun one.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Supposed Successor — Part 3
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerAfter leaving the castle, Nell and I spent a good bit of time walking around the city. It took us roughly half an hour to finally reach the extravagant building that supposedly served as the church’s headquarters. As one would expect, it was extremely large and appeared to contain enough history for it to be labelled as a world heritage site.There was a minor hitch in our plans, and while it certainly did affect us in the short term, it wasn’t one that changed anything in the long run. Our original idea was to inform the church of both Nell’s revival and our engagement through the lady knight that was her boss. But that fell through, as Nell’s direct superior was not currently in town. She had been sent off on a mission in order to accomplish an objective or two elsewhere. We suspected that divulging our engagement to someone higher up the ladder may not have exactly been wise given my lack of association with any of the individuals in question and the current instability of Nell’s position, so we decided to hold off on it for the time being.In fact, I didn’t even end up joining her for her report. As someone completely unaffiliated to the church or the officials that were present, I ended up stuck in a waiting room while she caught up with the brass.She seemed to feel bad about leaving me out to dry, as the first thing she greeted me with upon returning was an apologetic smile before briefing me on everything that came up in her discussions. Carlotta’s superior had apparently given her an earful; he had not been content with her prolonged absence. You know, I’m starting to think waiting out here probably would’ve been the better choice even if I was allowed in. I probably would’ve ended up getting pissed and acting way out of line.One thing that I ended up learning long after deciding to marry Nell was that, apparently, marriage in Allysia was a rather simple ordeal. Unlike in Japan, there was no need for anything as complicated as signing a series of documents, nor was it standard practice to marry in a church. I’d assumed that marriage was what churches were for, but apparently, I was wrong. Only high ranking nobles, like dukes and members of the royal line, had to go through such an arduous, ritualistic process.For those of common birth, an agreement was all that was required to set things in motion. Informing one’s relatives wasn’t even considered absolutely necessary, though it was naturally common practice. That was another one of the reasons I had tagged along for the journey. I had to meet Nell’s parents, or rather, parent. Meeting the woman responsible for single-handedly raising one of the women in my life was a task that even I found monumental. It was, without a doubt, going to be the hardest part of this whole trip. Even just thinking about it made me nervous. Come on, Yuki, you got this. Just run it through a few times in your head, and you’ll be fine.With that thought in mind, we returned to the castle and called it a night.***The next morning got off to what could only be described as an unfortunate start. I found myself standing in the middle of the colosseum-like structure attached to the castle, the royal army’s training grounds. And when I say colosseum-like, I mean it. It’s even got the seats and everything. Anyway, I know exactly what you’re thinking. “What the fuck, Yuki? How the hell did you end up there?” Honestly, I’m not really all that sure myself.I was, of course, not present entirely of my own volition. My morning was a bit of an odd one. I spent most of breakfast half asleep because I’d awoken in response to a conversation between Enne and Nell. After my meal, I was almost immediately visited by some sort of servant. The maid in question had apparently dropped by to inform me that I’d been summoned. Naturally, my first thought was, “why me?” I saw no reason anyone would want to see me over the hero. I had yet to figure out my plans for the rest of the day, so I ended up letting my curiosity get the better of me—only to regret it immediately upon arrival at my final destination.The noble that had gone out of their way to grab me was one I had the displeasure of recognizing.“The stage is set, and all is ready for us to engage in single combat!” Mr. Fancypants greeted me with the most self-important grin a human could possibly have. His arms were crossed, and his chin was raised, seemingly just so he could make it look like he was looking down on me.Oh boy… Not this shit again.“You want me to duel you…?” I sighed.
“That’s right, meister! Pick up a sword and steel yourself so that I can prove once and for all that you’re no match for me!”
“Uh huh…” I rolled my eyes as I turned around. “Well, you have fun doing you. I’m heading back to my room. See ya.”
“Huh? W-w-wait! Where are you going!? Why are you refusing my challenge!?”The duke’s son spent a few moments in utter confusion before circling in front of me to act as a physical barrier between me and the exit.“What do you mean, why am I refusing? I don’t know about you, but I don’t see a reason for me to put up with any of your shit.”Like, seriously? What the actual fuck? Didn’t I just kick this retard’s ass yesterday? Talk about persistent. At first, I wasn’t really sure if Mr. Fancypants was acting tough or stupid. Looking back on our interactions, however, soon led me to realize it was probably the latter. None of the actions he’d demonstrated thus far had reeked of even the slightest bit of intelligence.All the commotion we caused naturally led the other soldiers present to turn their eyes towards us. They began quietly whispering to one another at a distance, but my fine-tuned senses allowed me to hear them perfectly regardless.“Hey guys, are you seeing what I’m seeing…? Because I think that’s the Masked Meister,” said a royal guard.
“It must be. The mask he’s got on matches how everyone’s been describing it perfectly,” said another. “I heard a few of the maids mention that he was staying in the castle for a while. I thought it was just a rumour.”
“It looks like he’s talking to Sir Manuel,” added a third.
“Yeah, it does, but why would the meister be talking to someone like him?”
“Well, you know how Sir Manuel is…”
“Right… Good point. I can’t believe even the meister has to put up with him…”And here I thought I was the only one that thought he was obnoxious. It turned out that there wasn’t anyone particularly charmed by Mr. Fancypants’ “sociable” personality—and that he apparently caused situations much like the current one all the goddamn time.“You cannot refuse this request.” Unaware of all the gossip going on behind his back, the noble continued to speak in a tone that dripped with confidence. “It comes from both the second son of a duke and the hero’s soon to be successor.”“The hero’s soon to be successor?” I raised a brow. “And who the fuck is that?”“Me, of course! Who else!?” He squawked at me indignantly before faking a cough to both regain his composure and shift topics. “I only ended up leaving yesterday because I realized that there was something I had to attend to immediately. I can’t have you looking down on me given that I will soon become this country’s hero. So today, I’ll be showing you my true power.”Alright, let me just get this straight. This dumbfuck’s going to be taking Nell’s place? Seriously? Gimme a break. Look at how low his stats are… I mean, sure, he’s got some pretty good numbers, for a human, but that ain’t saying much. Nell has always been much stronger, even when she was just starting out.“Woooow Manny, you’re soooo cool. Self-proclaimed titles are just sooooooo impressive.” Again, I rolled my eyes. “But hey, you know what, it’s a good dream. Do your best. I’m sure you’ll get strong enough to be a hero eventually.”
“I-It isn’t self-proclaimed!” He shouted, indignantly. “I wasn’t the one that brought the idea up, I’m just doing it because I was told that the duty would ultimately fall to me!”
“…So you’re telling me that someone else made you step up to the plate?”
“That’s right! I was told that my power would be needed for us to keep Allysia stable and that I would need to become our country’s next hero!”Interesting… After making a mental note of the fact that I had lucked out, I began contemplating Mr. Fancypants’ circumstances. The man that had been looking to put him on the hero’s pedestal was likely one with a vested interest in getting Nell to step down. I very highly doubted that the two were unrelated. The duke’s son suited their purposes perfectly. The combination of his lineage and his above-average strength made him the perfect piece to parade around. And his lack of brainpower was, if anything, an advantage, as it was unlikely he would think too deeply about the circumstances or catch on to all of the shady things his sponsors were up to. Too bad working with idiots is a double-edged sword, huh? Time to take full advantage of the situation and milk him for all the intel he’s got.The overly well-dressed noble was certainly aiming high, but intelligence aside, his personality wasn’t doing him any favours. A hero was a public figure, which meant he needed to swallow his pride if he wanted other people to like him. Not that he’ll be any match for Nell, by any measure, even if he does.“Alright, Manny, you know what? I’ve changed my mind. I’ll spar with you or whatever. But only under one condition. If I win, then you tell me all about the guy who told you that you’d be the next hero.”
“Is that really all you want?” He eyed me suspiciously. “Fine. And if you’re strong enough to defeat me, then I might, might, consider allowing you to become one of my subordinates when I finally take on the hero’s mantle.” He walked over to a nearby shelf and grabbed a pair of wooden blades as he spoke. “But I already know that will never happen. Because I am very, very strong!”He chucked one of the practice weapons at me whilst continuing to act like a pompous ass.“Yeah uhh… I’mma just pass on that ahead of time,” I said. “You sure you wanna do this with wooden swords and not real ones?”
“Of course! The point of this exercise is for us to better ourselves. There’s no rhyme or reason in risking a serious injury in training.”Huh… Wow, he’s less of a douche than I thought. I was expecting him to use this as an excuse to try and off me.“Mr Demon Lord!”A faraway shout, one certainly outside human earshot, interrupted my thoughts. The appendages on either side of my head twitched as I tuned into the conversation my senses had detected.“…Mr. Demon Lord?” said Ronia, suspiciously.
“Oh uhm… don’t mind that. We were playing a game of make-believe with Lady Iryll earlier. I was the hero, and he was the demon lord, so I guess it must’ve just stuck,” said Nell.
“I see…” The mage didn’t seem very convinced, but decided not to pursue the topic any further.
“That sounds really fun, but I don’t think we’ve ev—” Iryll began to speak, but Nell cut her off before she could finish her sentence.
“A-Alright, it looks like he’s going to be duelling someone, so let’s cheer him on together, Lady Iryll!”
“That sounds like a great idea!” replied the petite princess. “Do your best, Mr. Demon Lord! I know you can do it!”I decided to entertain the princess by turning around to face her. As I did, she began waving with big, wide motions in order to get my attention. It turned out that the girls were seated in the bleachers. I was a bit surprised to see them all present, but figured that it was probably because Nell had grabbed them before following in my footsteps. Well, Nell, it’s going to be up to you to make sure Magegirl doesn’t figure out my identity. Don’t let me down. I’m counting on you.***(APRIL FOOL’S PRANK) TL Note: As Cardboard Translations is not an essential service, we will be temporarily shutting down for the duration of the government lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Side Story: Morning
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerNell awoke from her slumber right as the morning sun began peeking through the curtains. Her eyelids, still heavy from drowsiness, slowly fluttered open and closed as she raised herself to a seated position. With one last yawn, she shook off the last bit of lethargy that clouded her mind and readied herself for the day ahead.The first place she cast her gaze upon regaining her sentience was the bed beside her’s. In it lay a man, one with a rare, dark shade of hair not often seen in Allysia or any of its surrounding territories.Realizing that this was a rare opportunity to observe him in his sleep, Nell got off the soft, heavenly piece of furniture she had spent the night on and quietly approached him. She slowly, silently stepped across the room, stopping only to carefully climb onto his bed so she could sit herself down near the upper half of his body. The close proximity in which the two had lived over the course of the past month had not presented her with many chances to catch him before he awoke. And that was in spite of the fact that he was a night owl; he played board games with Lefi into the dead of the night every single day. And yet, he would always be awake before her. Even though she thought herself an early riser.This bizarre phenomenon stemmed from Yuki’s identity as a demon lord, a creature overflowing with an unimaginable surplus of power relative to any run of the mill member of the races. On his home turf, the dungeon supplied him with a surplus of energy and reduced his need for sleep. Only Lyuu, who happened to be in the habit of getting up incredibly early, would rise before him. This had, on multiple occasions, led Nell to wake up and head over to the kitchen to help with breakfast only to find it already sitting on the dining room table.Being outside the dungeon’s territory, however, threw a wrench into the cogs of Yuki’s biorhythm. With his stamina well gone, the demon lord required energy. This led him to do many things he normally didn’t, such as consuming alarming amounts of food. He would eat so much, in fact, that Nell had begun to feel as if dinner time served as a demonstration of the extent of his might. He had a lot of strength to restore, after all. Another way he cut down on calorie consumption was by remaining in sleep mode. Resting for longer than usual—and therefore providing Nell with ample opportunity to stare at his face while he remained none the wiser—was merely another aspect of the same energy-based complication.Upon getting a good look at him, she realized that, in his sleep, he looked much more boyish than he did while he was up and about. He wasn’t exactly babyfaced, but he definitely looked younger than the rest of his frame suggested. In fact, she almost felt as if he seemed her age. Seeing the innocent, near angelic expression that adorned his face in his sleep made it difficult for her to picture him as the monster-slaying powerhouse he was. That, however, was nothing new. The mischievous, whimsical way in which he conducted himself while he was awake made it equally hard, if not impossible, for an innocent, unknowing bystander to mark him as a demon lord.She had, ever since the day the two first met, thought that he was almost like a friendly neighbor, one with a few more years than her under his belt. And she continued to feel that way, even now. It was like he was the childhood friend she never had. Almost like they’d grown up together. Even though she’d only known him for a year.That was just how much he meant to her.With a giggle, one that resulted from imagining him in his early childhood, she put the thought aside and refocused herself on observing him. His hair was a mess of spikes. Tufts of it stuck out of literally everywhere and pointed off in random directions. But much to Nell’s surprise, it was soft and even surprisingly silky to the touch. She felt, as she gently combed her fingers through his quills, put at ease by his warmth.As the comfort of his proximity permeated through her fingertips and melted into her body, her heart slowly began to accelerate. Each beat came a fraction of a second faster than the last. Because she knew that touching him the way she was now was something that she would never do under any normal circumstance. There were always far too many eyes on her, and it was too embarrassing to perform such a public display of affection.But now, it was okay.It was just him and her.And no one else.Warmth filled her chest. Her heart began to sing with such vigour it pained her. Still, she continued to smile as she took his hair in her fingers.But before long, their alone time came to an end. She heard a quiet, waking groan, one that came not from him, but rather, the couch that served as the guest room’s centrepiece.Looking towards it, she found a young girl whose hair matched Yuki’s own. Not in terms of how messy it was, but rather, in terms of its rare, elusive colour. Her garments, which looked to be some sort of traditional garb belonging to a people not indigenous to the region, swayed to and fro as she rubbed her eyes.“Good morning, Enne,” said the brunette.
“Mmmnnn… Morning…” yawned the sword.She was to the demon lord what Durandal was to the hero, the trusted companion he dubbed his primary armament. Thus, she had naturally been taken along for the journey. As she was aware that this was, for Nell, a rare chance to spend some time alone with her beloved, the blade had chosen to spend most of her time sleeping inside the spatial tear in which Yuki stored all of the things he carried around. Nell truly appreciated the gesture, as she knew that the sword was doing something that it otherwise would have preferred not to—and that she was sure to be either bored or lonely despite claiming that it was fair given that she was typically allowed to spend all the time she ever wanted at her master’s side.There was, of course, no reason to keep her locked up while everyone was asleep, so Yuki had retrieved her and placed her against the sofa, where she had slept until morning. Upon waking up, she had used Personification skill and taken on a human form so she could better communicate with her wielder’s bride-to-be.“What are you doing?” Zaien tilted her head at an angle as if in hopes that a new perspective would allow her to glean additional insight on Nell’s actions.
“I don’t get very many opportunities to watch him sleep,” replied the hero. “So I thought that I might as well stare while I’ve got the chance. Want to join me?”
“…Mmk.”Enne walked over, climbed onto the bed, and sat herself down right next to her human companion.“Master is… still asleep.”
“Mhm.”
“How rare,” said Enne. “…It makes him seem cute. I don’t know why.”
“I was just about to say the same thing,” giggled Nell.The air about him was calm, virtuous even. It differed greatly from the atmosphere often created by the actions undertaken by him in expressing his larger-than-life personality. Yuki always claimed that he wasn’t anywhere near as exaggerated as Lefi, but Nell disagreed. In her eyes, his eccentricity could be perfectly summarized by one of his favorite phrases, “Fuck logic. Just use brute force.”“He kind of looks like Rir,” said Enne, suddenly.
“Uhm… A-are you sure…?”
“Mhm,” nodded Enne.Before long, the pair’s conversation caused the demon lord whose bedside they sat by to stir. He blinked a few times, sat up, and turned towards the two girls, whom he had spotted out of the corner of his eye.“Good morning Yuki. I’m sorry, did we wake you up?”
“Morning, Master.”
“Mornin’…” groaned the demon lord. “So, mind telling me why you two are on my bed?”
“Oh, you know, no reason.”At first, Nell had managed to stifle her laughter, but soon, she ended up breaking into an uncontrollable giggling fit. The way he’d looked at her, with his eyes sleepy and half closed, made it so he really did resemble Rir.“Told you.” Enne immediately picked up on the cause of the other girl’s laughter. And though her expression didn’t change, she began giving off an aura of triumph.Yuki, who was completely left out of the loop, stared in confusion as the two girls shared a moment of bliss.<– Prev — Next –>

The Hero’s Supposed Successor — Part 4
Editor(s): SpeedphoenixIt turned out that Mr. Fancypants was every bit as weak as I expected him to be. He didn’t have anything particularly interesting up his sleeve, nor any hidden trump cards worthy of note. Even now, he was out of breath. Every consecutive swing caused him to either grunt or pant with exhaustion. I, on the other hand, was still in top form. It took me little to no effort to casually sidestep each and every single one of his attacks.“Damn it!” he cursed. “Why won’t you attack me!? Could it be that you’re afraid of my awe-inspiring techni—”
“In your dreams, kid.”I evaded a blow aimed at my torso and smacked him over the head with my wooden armament.The action was one that, like basically everything else I’d done, caused the princess to brighten up and sing me praise. There were a whole slew of different cheers, but most ultimately sounded like something along the lines of “You’re the best, Mr. Demon Lord!”She wasn’t the only one appraising my skills either. The king’s men had also become a part of the peanut gallery.“How fearsome…” commented a soldier. “He’s warding off even Sir Manuel’s blows with ease.”
“I’ve seen many of Sir Manuel’s duels, and I can say for certain that he’s one of the toughest fighters I know,” said one of his friends. “The meister’s ability to overwhelm him so easily, especially without even taking up a stance, is proof that he’s simply that much more skilled. But I guess we shouldn’t be expecting anything less from Allysia’s saviour.”The soldiers’ statements weren’t exactly accurate. While I certainly didn’t have any trouble handling someone of Mr. Fancypants’ caliber, it wasn’t because I was more skilled than he was. If anything, the opposite was true. He was better than me with a sword; his attacks and feints were, frankly, far more refined than mine.But the difference in numbers turned the contest into a one-sided exchange. To me, he was practically moving in slow motion. That was why I never got hit, and why I never fell for any of his more deceptive blows. Again, I was reminded that, as a race, humans were incredibly weak. I was fairly certain that I could easily crush his skull and splatter his brains all over the arena if I chose to smack him with all my strength. Even with a shoddy, wooden blade.Evidence of this could be seen in his exhaustion. The barrages he’d thrown at me, backed by the full extent of his strength, had taken their toll on his stamina. His movements had begun to dull, and his chest heaved with such force that it pushed against his armour every single time he took a breath.“If I was you, I’d be careful not to drop my sword.”There was no reason for me not to take advantage of the obvious weakness he showed, so I stepped forward after audibly warning him and smacked him in the arm just hard enough to make him involuntarily release his weapon.“Alrighty, looks like I win.”
“N-No! You haven’t! Not yet!” Despite literally groaning in pain, he was unwilling to relent. “I won’t let this stop me. If I’m to become the hero, then I can’t possibly allow myself to lose!” He picked up the wooden sword and took up a stance as he spoke a line that caused me to raise an eyebrow.Something seemed off. I couldn’t stand Mr. Fancypants, but even so, a part of me seemed to be suspecting that he wasn’t the scumbag I’d initially made him out to be. He was far too persistent, too desperate to win. The sheer force of will he exhibited made me think it impossible for him to be doing this for fame or glory.“So why are you trying to take Nell’s place anyway?” With that in mind, I went straight to the point and questioned his intentions without beating around the bush.
“Why…? Why!? That should be obvious! The hero is supposed to serve as a symbol of Allysia’s power! The hero is never supposed to know difficulty, let alone defeat!” He spoke with impassioned fervour. “But ours has. And the people know. If they didn’t, then we could have kept the truth hidden away. But it’s far too late for that. We need a new symbol, Meister, one that can put our people’s hearts at ease.”He paused to catch his breath, but I remained both silent and unmoving. I wanted to know what else he had to say.“And that isn’t all,” he continued. “I can’t stand the thought that she, a woman, stands as our people’s shield. The battlefield is no place for women! Women are meant to be protected, kept out of harm’s way, not stained with blood or guilt or thrown into the frenzy of war! We should be arming them with needles and yarn and leaving the men to bear swords and spears! It’s for their own good. So that they can spend their lives in peace.”It was then that I realized I’d got him all wrong. Well, almost. I still think he’s a douche, but whatever.His attitude had initially led me to assume that he too was just trying to screw Nell over for profit. But that wasn’t true. He certainly had wanted her to step down, even against her own wishes, but only because he believed it to be for her own good. Because he felt that, as a man, he was responsible for bearing her burden.He’d just been far too clumsy and proud to immediately express it.That was why he hadn’t reeked of malice.And why he hadn’t seemed exactly like all the other shitheads I’d met. That’d been my initial impression of him as well, but at the time, I’d brushed it off as a figment of my imagination. For fuck’s sake, dude. Why the hell are you acting one way when you clearly feel the other? We’ve got a word for this in Japan, it’s called being a “tsundere.” Acting like that as a dude just makes you seem like a creep, so knock it off.“Hmm… I see.” He was done with his rant, so I made a short statement as if to appraise his intentions.
“Now come at me, Masked Meister! This isn’t over ye—”I did exactly as he instructed and went on the offence. I drilled a foot into his sword and snapped it in half before dropping low and sweeping his legs out from under him. As he collapsed, face first, I stabbed my own weapon into the ground right by his head.“Alright, so like I was saying, looks like I win,” I said. This time, the victory was too decisive for him to refute me. “Oh, and don’t worry about the whole defeat thing. This is just training. No one’s going to say jack shit about one botched spar.”He groaned, clearly frustrated. But it was no longer possible for him to claim that he still had a chance, so he allowed the strength to leave his body in an admission of defeat, all whilst biting his lips in vexation.“Alright. And now you’ve gotta apologize to Nell.”
“W-what!? Why would I have to do that!?”
“Why wouldn’t you? I mean, think about it. I just totally kicked your ass with almost no effort. And since I’m just one of her subordinates, you being weaker than me clearly means that you’re weaker than her too,” I said. It was a bit of an illogical fib. I was stronger than my fiancée. But he didn’t need to know that. “Feel free to keep calling yourself the next hero or whatever. I don’t really care how you feel about any of that shit. This whole apology thing is just ‘cause I think that you probably owe it to her after saying all that bullshit about her being too weak, despite being way weaker than her.”
“I guess you do have a point…” he groaned.
“Looks like we’ve come to an understanding then,” I said. “I’mma grab her. Make sure you keep your word.” I turned towards the bleachers and shouted loudly enough for my voice to echo throughout the stadium. “Hey, Nell! Get down here for a sec!”The bob-haired brunette tilted her head in confusion and pointed to herself inquisitively, so I nodded and used my hand to gesture that I wanted her to head over.“It seems like he needs me for something, so I’ll be right back,” she excused herself from the conversation she was having with Ronia and the princess and quickly jogged towards me. “What is it?”
“Well, you see, it turns out Manny over here has a little something to say to you.”The verbal prodding seemed to have done the trick, as Mr. Fancypants ultimately decided to speak.“I-I’m very sorry, Lady Nell.” He was so reluctant and embarrassed, that he chose to keep his face in the dirt over looking at her. “I must admit that, given my inability to defeat your subordinate, it was wrong of me to think that I was in a position where my opinions about your qualifications were justified. Please forgive me.”It took a few seconds for Nell to deduce that this whole scenario was my handiwork, but the brief moment she’d spent in visible confusion was long enough to prompt Mr. Fancypants to hesitantly raise his eyes to gauge her reaction.“Oh, well, uhm… I don’t really think losing to Wye here is really anything to be all that upset about. He’s too strong for his own good,” she said with a wry smile. “But you know what? I think you did have a point. I’m still not as strong as I should be. So uhm… how about we put this whole incident behind us so we can both keep doing our best to get as strong as we can? For Allysia’s sake.”She smiled as she extended a hand towards him.Mr. Fancypants was shocked. The harsh, demeaning scolding he had been expecting was nowhere to be found. And in its place was a gentle warmth.Slowly, he reached towards her and took her hand.“W-Will you marr—”
“Finish that sentence, and you’re fucking dead,” I growled.
“S-sorry, nevermind!” he stammered as a spell of cold sweat assaulted him.“Y-you’re absolutely right, m-milady. L-l-let’s both do our best! F-for Allysia!”<– Prev — Next –>

Lighting the Next Hero’s Torch
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, JokerMr. Fancypants’ attitude took a full 180 as soon as Nell charmed him with her angelic smile. He fully cooperated with us, recounting everything he knew in detail and clarifying whatever we asked. There had apparently been a whole group of people egging him on. It was led by a pair of counts and supported by the members of their clique, a whole slew of nobles of lesser importance.“Hmmm… I see…” I brooded on the knight’s words for a few moments before addressing him again. “Well, Manny, that just leaves one question.”
“W-what?” He cast a few nervous glances in Nell’s direction as he stuttered out a reply, all in spite of going on and on about how women shouldn’t be heroes just a few minutes prior.At this point, I’m not sure if he’s wearing his emotions on his sleeve or just plain stupid. Oh wait.“You done trying to kick Nell’s off the hero’s pedestal, or what?” I said, after entertaining a rude thought.
“U-Uhm, I er… yes. I am. I now understand that being a hero is not just about swinging a sword around. Being as kind and merciful as a saint is of equal importance.” He said. “I know now that I was a fool to think that Nell lacked a hero’s qualities, so you’ll hear no more dissidence from me.”The fuck is he going on about now? Like, actually, where did that even, okay, you know what? Whatever. After catching myself rolling my eyes and giving him a less-than-entertained smile, I decided not to think about it and just moved on.“Are you still going to try your hand at being her successor or whatever?”
“Of course!” He placed a hand on his chest as he made a declaration. “I will endeavour to grow into a great warrior so that I can stand by her side as one of Allysia’s guardians, as promised!”
“Uhm… Right… Let’s both do our best,” said Nell with an awkward half-cringe, half-smile.Hey, douchebag, knock it off. Stop making my fiancée cringe. I warned him internally as I grabbed an item from my inventory and tossed it in his direction. “Well, in that case, I guess you can have this.”
“Is that a wooden sword…?” He gave a dubious stare as it flew through the air, only to falter as he caught and nearly dropped it. “W-what!? Why is it so heavy?!”
“I mean… it’s a sword, and it’s made out of wood. So yes, Captain Obvious, it is a wooden sword,” I said, sarcastically. “But don’t let that fool you. It’s nothing like your average, run of the mill training weapon. It’s the toughest thing you’ll ever use, and it’s chock full of mana, so it even works as a good catalyst for casting spells. So long as you have that, you won’t even need a wand or a staff.” I began listing off the weapon’s properties from memory. “Hell, I’d say it’s probably even a match for some of the more well-known weapons out there. It’s shaped like a katana, er, I mean it’s curved and only has its outer edge sharpened, but I don’t think cutting with it is going to work all that well. It does do a pretty good job of inflicting blunt force trauma though, ‘cause of how hard it is.”Most of the information I’d described could be seen in the weapon’s entry when appraised, which looked as follows:***
Demon Lord’s Wooden Blade
Quality Rating: B+
This wooden katana was created by a demon lord by the name of Yuki from a branch of a tree known as an Adamantine Wizardwood. The demon lord channelled an excessive amount of mana through the weapon’s corpus during its creation, which led it to grow tougher than iron. It is an incredibly efficient conductor of magical energy and can be used as a catalyst in the casting of magic.***The only part I’d left out was that it was made from a species of tree that grows within the Wicked Forest. Despite being made of wood, it was tough as nails and could probably be used to smash a metal-based weapon in two without much trouble.I wasn’t all that sure about its functionality as a catalyst. I’d only attempted to use it to cast magic once, and I hadn’t actually been all that convinced it’d made a difference, in part because I didn’t actually know how one was supposed to feel when using a staff, and in part because Enne was a way better conductor of magical energy. Moreover, she even came with extra features, such as the ability to cast spells without any input on my end. Not that comparing the two is really all that fair. I mean, sure, I made both, but Enne’s my daughter-cum-masterpiece, whereas that thing’s literally just some random piece of wood. Oh yeah, totally irrelevant side note, but I was thinking of inscribing “Lake Touya” on the side to make it resemble a certain comedic samurai’s signature blade, but I ended up giving up on the idea because I’ve got literally no skill when it comes to engraving.“Hmmm…” Manny carefully ran his eyes along the weapon’s length. “I certainly can feel a great power emanating from within it. Are you sure that you’re willing to give me this for free? It seems rather expensive.”
“Hey, no worries. Just think of it as my way of thanking you for all the intel,” I said. “Plus, you’re still trying to pull off that whole hero thing, right? I figured you probably need to put in a good bit more effort, and this’ll probably help.”I had only originally crafted the weapon for my own entertainment. It had turned out much better than I’d expected it to. While it wasn’t good enough to use, it’d hit the quality bar that made me feel as if throwing it away was kind of wasteful, so I’d chucked it in the back of my inventory and effectively forgot about it. This seemed like a decent opportunity to get rid of it. Passing it off meant doing it more justice than letting it rot. Though if I told him that, he’d probably get mad, so I’mma just shut up. Anyway, point is that he’s got everything he needs. So all he’s gotta do now is work his ass off and git gud so Nell can retire and come live in the dungeon.“Does this mean that you intend to become one of the members of my party after al—”
“Fuck no! I literally already told you I wouldn’t!”***After a few more slightly frustrating exchanges, Nell and I regrouped with her two companions and headed out.“For fuck’s sake,” I squeezed out a few words as I stretched my limbs. “Dealing with idiots is exhausting. Why the hell did I have to waste an entire morning on him of all people?”
“Well, he didn’t seem all bad. I thought that he had some pretty respectable intentions. He was just a little misdirected.”
“Ehhhh…”
“And didn’t you take a liking to him? Isn’t that why you gave him one of the weapons you made?”
“Nah, you’ve got all wrong. I only gave him that sword for the sword’s sake. I felt kinda bad for it since it was just sitting around in my inventory,” I said, “besides, I figured a little present like that would probably go a pretty decent way in the long run. If he works hard enough, you can retire and move in.”
“W-wait, you were thinking that far ahead already?”
“Well, yeah. Of course,” I said. “I’ve been thinking about all this since the moment you started talking about going through with this whole duty of yours or whatever. I mean, I do want you to move into the castle, and I’ll basically do anything I can to accelerate the process. But I still do want to keep your wishes in mind too.”I grinned at her and shrugged, which caused her face to brighten up with glee.Since we’d reached a bit of a natural break in the conversation, I turned towards the pair that accompanied her to the arena.“So how did you two end up tagging along anyway?”
“I visited your room so we could all play together!” answered the princess. “She told me that you went to the training grounds, so we decided to go see what you were doing. We ran into Ronia along the way, and she decided to come too!”
“Ronia’s usually busy, but she happened to have a little bit of free time today,” elaborated Nell.Ohhh, so that’s what happened.“Do you ever wear armour?” The mage in question interjected herself into the conversation with a sudden question. “I didn’t see you with any in the demon realm. And you didn’t wear any just now either.”
“Now that you mention it, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him with any armour on either,” said Nell.
“Yeah, I just kinda don’t. I know it sounds weird, but I’ve got some pretty good reasons for it.”The reason I never wore anything but casualwear was because, in the Wicked Forest, there was no point in wearing anything else. Armour was, if anything, entirely detrimental. None of the mid-ranged armour listed in the catalogue was able to provide any significant protection against even the Wicked Forest’s weakest creatures. The high-end stuff could, but not even that was a match for anything that lived in the western region, where all the stronger monsters resided. A single hit was all even the best armour could take before being made unusable despite costing an inordinate amount of DP.My strategy revolved around fleeing at top speed whenever I encountered something I couldn’t defeat. Something as heavy as a giant, chest-mounted piece of metal would not only get in the way of a swift retreat, but also make it more difficult for me to move around in general. Moreover, my body was already fairly tough as is. It was capable of tanking a hit from a dragon, a member of this world’s most powerful species. That was why I was confident in my ability to survive at least one hit from anything. All I had to do was guard my vitals, which I’d grown rather skilled at doing, endure the pain, and heal myself with a potion. I never had to worry about potentially not being able to down my medicine in time because Rir always had my back and covered me until I was back to full health. Thinking about it, why do soldiers wear armour anyway? It does nothing but make them more sluggish. Hell, they’re even crazy enough to wear helmets that obscure their vision. The members of this world’s races are far more powerful than the humans back in my world ever were. So how the hell does a thin ass sheet of metal actually do anything? Yeah, Iunno, none of this really makes any sense at all, as far as I’m concerned.After a moment of internal pondering, I summarized my explanation to the girls whilst excluding anything that might clue Ronia in on my identity.“Oh…” said Nell. “So you really did have a reason… I always thought you just liked wearing those weird work clothes because that was just your style.”
“Work clothes? What do you mean, work clothes. This is casual wear,” I said.As I was basically always holed up in the dungeon anyway, I never saw any reason to wear anything that didn’t put comfort first, so I was perpetually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt.“I see…” said Ronia. “So you’re a demon lord?”
“Ye—I mean, uh, of course not…” The question had been asked in such a natural fashion that I ended up accidentally nodding along and acknowledging that she was correct before I even thought about it. I tried to cover it up, but realized it was already far too late. “Alright, yeah, you got me. No point in hiding it if you’ve already got it all figured out,” I said.I blame the princess.“Nell is bad at lying. I knew the moment she tried,” said Ronia. “Does that make you the Wicked Forest’s demon lord? That’s the only one she knows, so I don’t think it could have been any other. Is her mission how you two met?”Wow. She’s basically figured it all out. Goddamn, girl’s got brains. I guess she ain’t a court mage for nothing, huh?“U-uhm, well, uhm… you see, Ronia, there are lots of reasons for this…” Nell, who was standing beside me, flubbed about in a flustered panic.
“It’s okay, Nell. It doesn’t matter what he is. All that matters to me is that he saved your life.”
“Thanks, Ronia. I really appreciate it…” said the hero, meekly.
“Mr. Demon Lord is a demon lord, but he’s actually more like a hero!” exclaimed the princess. “He’s really cool and even has really awesome wings!”
“I remember seeing them. They were impressive enough to make me feel the urge to study them,” said the mage.
“Uh… thanks, I guess?”Is that supposed to be a compliment? I really can’t tell.“Can we see your wings again, Mr. Demon Lord?” begged the princess.
“Uhh… sure, I guess, but it’ll have to wait since we’re in public right now,” I said.
“Yay! Oh, and can I see your home too?”
“Uhh… I live a bit too far away for that, I think. It’s also kinda dangerous, so that’s going to have to be a no. Sorry.”
“Aww… But don’t you live in a really big, awesome castle?” Her voice grew sadder and quieter as she spoke. “I haven’t really had any chances to go anywhere before, so I really wanted to visit and see it…”…“Alright, alright, I get it,” I said, giving in to guilt. “You can stay over for a few days when I head back. But only if your old man says it’s fine.”
“Oh my gosh! Really!?”
“Yeah, really. But again, only if he agrees. I’ll talk to him about it later.”
“Yay! That’s great! Thank you so much, Mr. Demon Lord! I’m so happy!”I ruffled the tiny girl’s hair as she showed me a cheerful smile.“…Does he like little girls?” asked Ronia.
“I think so,” said Nell. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him not be sweet on one.”
“Goddamn it! I told you like a billion times already, but I’m not a goddamn pedo!” I yelled, indignantly. “Besides, Nell, what the hell. Why would you even agree to that? Doesn’t that just make you look bad too?”You know, thinking about it, it’s been a while since anyone’s called me a pedo. Back at home, they’ve all pretty much agreed that I am, and they more or less think of it as common knowledge. Which, FYI, is definitely wrong. It bothers the hell out of me, but I guess they’ve at least stopped making fun of me when I play with the kids. Which is… probably a plus, right…?***I had gleaned a lot from Mr. Fancypants, but I didn’t know enough about Allysia’s political climate to make too much of it. Fortunately, my good friend the king did. I later ran everything I learned by him, and in doing so, discovered that the counts the wannabe hero had mentioned were uncoincidentally Argus’ close associates. The trio was often seen discussing one thing or another whenever they attended one of high society’s parties, which in turn meant that this entire scenario was most certainly connected to the bastard’s plans.The overly-exhausted monarch mentioned that he would look into their common associates in order to try to discern the mastermind, a statement which had almost led me to chuckle. I felt as if it would have been rather entertaining if the three had only one shared contact, and that the individual in question happened to be the bastard behind the scheme, mostly because that would have made the whole situation very much like those that were often seen in crime thrillers on TV. But as no one present would have even remotely come close to understanding my rationale, and because we were discussing a relatively serious topic, I realized that breaking into laughter wasn’t exactly the best choice and managed to stop myself short.Another fact I was made privy to was that the castle would soon find itself host to a grand ball. The event was on such a scale that nearly every noble in Allysia was sure to attend—including those I found unsavoury.Nell was slated to attend, both because she was effectively associated with high society, and because the king planned to use the gathering to announce her safe return. This made for the perfect place for me to make my move, so the monarch used his influence to secure me an invitation as well.All the time I spent between my arrival and the banquet was time I would use to secure evidence. The goal was to face the Anti-Nells in an upfront conversation through rule of law, and then either murder them myself or have them jailed for treason. I wasn’t absolutely certain that we would be able to successfully secure all the proof we needed to justify that, but I was confident that I would at least be able to sniff out a good enough portion of their plans to mitigate their effects. There was simply no way they were just going to sit tight while she and I did as we wished, which meant there would be plenty of trails for me to follow.The actions I’d decided to take this time around failed to follow my usual methodology. My usual approach would have been to strut my way in and laugh maniacally as I actively rejected social norms and did whatever the hell I wanted. But this time, I couldn’t. I’d already openly declared myself one of Nell’s subordinates, which meant my actions, especially the negative ones, were sure to reflect on what others thought of her. That was the only reason I had chosen the route of covert operations over waltzing into Argus’ mansion, torturing him until he spilled the beans, and burying him somewhere no one would find him once I was done. Nothing that broke that many rules would fly. If people found out that I was his murderer, then condemnation was sure to come from literally all directions. While the intuitive solution to such a problem would simply be not to get caught, the circumstances, unfortunately, made it much more complicated than just that. Everyone knew that Argus was one of Nell’s dissidents. Having him suddenly disappear, especially so soon after her return, was sure to turn many a distrustful gaze in her direction and rob her of her place amongst the humans.This time, I was going to play by the rules. I was going to handle the situation in a way that bolstered Nell’s prestige and hold off on playing the role of a murderhobo until the situation had calmed back down. There was sure to be an aftermath, but I figured that the king could probably do something about it. …Alright, just calling it out, but I owe both the king and the governor a good bit. I should probably figure out some way to pay them back.<– Prev — Next –>

A Stroll Through the Capital — Part 1
Editor(s): Speedphoenix, Joker“H-How do I look?”Nell nervously tugged at the hem of her dress as she did a little bit of a spin to show it off. Her voice was tinged with insecurity, no doubt in part due to the more tomboyish outfits in which she usually found herself clad.“Nell…” I got down on a knee and looked her right in the eyes.
“W-what?” she stammered. “W-why are you looking at me like that?”
“Marry me.”
“H-huh!? W-w-what’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”She went from looking at herself nervously to fidgeting about in a fit of embarrassment. Her face had gone from carrying a light, anxious blush to one that was full-on scarlet. The serious tone and expression with which I had conveyed the idea only served to further the extent of her reaction.“You’re so adorable that I just want to pick you up, take you home, and put you on display,” I continued, my tone unwavering and sincere. “You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever laid eyes on. Please be mine. Forever.”
“U-uhm… I-I’m really happy to hear you say all that, but I’d uhm… like if you could save it for when there isn’t anyone else around.”She glanced to the side as she fiddled with the fabric of her clothing. Looking beyond her ears, which were just as flushed as her face, I realized that we were being watched. The store’s clerk was giving us a look that clearly indicated she was less than amused.Oh, right. Yeah, she exists. Oops. It’s hard to hold back with Nell all dolled up like that. Unfortunately, I had no choice but to keep myself in check. Nell was far too shy to tolerate public displays of affection.“Alright, then how about we compromise. I’ll keep myself in check, but only if you put the dress back on again as soon as we get back to our room—and I get to flirt with you as much as I want.” I said. “It’ll be perfect. We can have ourselves a Nell-In-A-Dress Appreciation Party.”
“W-what’s that even supposed to mean!?” She squeaked. She paused after the question in an attempt to get me to explain myself, but I simply remained silent and continued to stare, which prompted her to panic, and then give in. “Okay, fine! I’ll do it, so please, just calm down! But if I’m going to put on a dress, then you have to put on a tuxedo too!” There was a jarring, sudden shift in her tone. She went from being panicked to strangely excited. “W-what do you think, Yuki? I think that sounds like a great idea!”Nell and I were currently at a tailor. There was simply no choice for us but to visit the shop given the nature of our circumstances. The grand ball, or whatever the king was calling it, was to be happening in the immediate future, and neither of us had any clothes appropriate to the occasion. While I certainly didn’t care for formalwear myself, I did still enjoy the experience; it had taught me the wonders of putting Nell in a dress.Though often dressed in armour, she had always been the type of girl whose appearance was both prim and proper. I was already willing to declare that Nell was basically the cutest thing ever under normal conditions. Throwing a gown into the mix only emphasized the destructive force of her charms. Her cuteness levels had gotten to the point where I was willing to bet that she could pierce the heavens and take down the anti-spirals. Holy shit, I’m so flustered that I’m not even sure what the fuck I’m saying anymore.“Wait, you want me to put on my tux? Ehhh… I dunno.” I frowned. “I don’t really see the point in it. I kind of just picked a random one off the shelf because it looked like it would fit. Besides, who the hell cares how the guys look anyways? Events like the ball are all about the girls.”Seriously. Why even bother dressing up a man? It’s a waste of both time and effort.“I’m not really sure I agree…” said Nell, disappointed. “I really wanted to see you in a tux. Aren’t you at least going to try it on?”
“Nah, I’m good. I checked the size, and it should fit, so I’m not going to bother,” I said. “I hate formalwear. It’s always way too tight to be comfortable.”
“Aw… I still really want to see you wear it though,” she frowned. “How about this then. I’ll only put on my dress if you put on your tux.”
“Ugh… fine.” I groaned, before turning to the lady at the front desk, who still happened to be giving us a less than amused stare. “Excuse me, ma’am, how long will it take for you guys to finish the final adjustments?” The tone I used with her was one a bit more polite than my usual.
“We’ll need approximately three hours,” she said. “We can have your items delivered to you if you inform us where you’re staying.”
“I appreciate the offer, but no thank you. We’ll be picking them up in person.” I said before turning back to the hero. “Alright Nell, you heard her. We’ve got three whole hours to burn. Got any ideas?”
“Hmmm…” She spent a few moments in contemplation. “How about we do some sightseeing? I think you mentioned wanting to enjoy some of Alshir’s tourist attractions, so how about I show you around?”
“That sounds like a great idea. Let’s do it.”***We got ourselves measured to give the tailor some concrete numbers to work with and left the store. No sooner than stepping outside did we find ourselves blasted by a literal wall of noise. The city’s main street was crowded with people going to and fro; there were a countless number of people moving in every direction.“Is there anything in particular you wanted to see?” asked Nell, as she looked up at me.
“I mean, I don’t really know what there is to begin with,” I said as I turned my head to the side to face her. “So not reall—oh wait. Do you know if there are any places that sell handicrafts? I’ve been meaning to check some of those out for a good while.”
“Handicrafts? I didn’t know you were interested in those.”
“I’m not,” I said. “But you know how I make a lot of my own stuff? I’ve been meaning to check out other people’s designs, you know, for reference and whatnot.”Lefi had her wedding ring already, but the same couldn’t be said for Lyuu or Nell. There’d certainly been opportunities for me to hand them over, but I’d ultimately ended up missing each and every one. In my defence, I’ve still got a full year before Lyuu and I are officially hitched, and Nell was staying over as a guest, so I didn’t want to just spring it on her like that.While I certainly found it to be a good excuse, their status as my fiancees was not the reason I hadn’t put rings on them just yet. Rather, it stemmed more so from my indecisiveness. I couldn’t decide whether to make their rings or buy them, and regardless of which of the two options I picked, I would first need to examine the market and see what rings made by other people tended to look like.“Oh yeah… You do make all sorts of weird things all the time,” said my brunette companion.
“W-weird!? What do you mean, weird!? None of the stuff I make is weird at all! Besides, don’t you know that most era-defining inventions have come out of what most considered worthless piles of junk!? Do you know what that means!? It means that every little thing I make has the potential to be revolutionary enough to make a fortune!”
“Okay, Yuki, whatever you say,” giggled Nell. “Everything you make is amazing, and unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. I’m sure you’ve invented plenty of revolutionary items already.”
“Uh… yeah… that.”The way she placated me as one would an excited child caused me to immediately lose all my momentum. I felt too embarrassed to keep talking. I just couldn’t, not after that.“Okay, let’s go. There’s a flea market not too far from here. I’m sure it’ll have plenty of people selling their handicrafts.”
“Alrighty then, lead the way,” my confidence began to fade as I spoke. “And uhm… here.”I slowly, awkwardly extended a hand in her direction. A faint blush crept onto her face, one that surely matched my own, as she realized my intentions and hesitantly accepted the invitation.Now hand in hand, we navigated through the densely packed crowd.But I paid it little mind.I was more focused on the warmth I felt conveyed to me through my hand and the occasional touch of her shoulder brushing against my own.We were just holding hands.And yet, I somehow found myself feeling incredibly soothed, comforted, filled with a warmth I continued to bask in until I was pulled back to reality by a giggle, one that had come from the girl by my side.“What?” I asked.
“I just started thinking about the last time we walked around a city together,” she said. “You and Lefi were incredibly hard to keep up with. The two of you did whatever you wanted with no concern for how much trouble you were causing me.”Her words seemed accusational, but the tone she spoke in was more indicative of nostalgia than anger.“Oh, you mean when we were checking out Alfyro? Oh man, yeah, that was fun. Especially with how much you were panicking.”
“Oh, is that right?” She flashed me an unhappy glare. “You were having fun because I was panicking?”
“Yeah, Iunno, having you around tends to bring out the sadist in me. I just can’t help but want to tease you,” I said. “But if anything, that’s a good thing. It means you’re fun to have around.”
“I know you’re expecting me to be happy to hear that, but I’m not,” she smiled awkwardly before continuing, “That was the first time anyone’s treated me like that since I became the hero. You basically dragged me around.” She smiled wistfully. “And then there was the attack. But even then, the two of you basically acted like it was nothing special, and resolved it in a heartbeat. The whole sequence of events was so ridiculous it had me completely blown away.”
“You’re making it sound like we’re weird, but honestly, from a normal person’s perspective, you’re not much different,” I said with a shrug.
“I-I am? I always thought I was pretty normal…”
“Do you really think a normal hero would marry a demon lord?”
“Good point. I guess I might be a bit of a weirdo after all,” she giggled and gave my hand a bit of a squeeze. Her eyes were directed at her feet in order to make it slightly more difficult to see the extent to which her face was flushed. “Oh, it looks like we’re almost there.” When she finally raised her eyes, she realized that we’d reached a set of crossroads. “We just have to make a right here, and then walk a little bit further.”
“Aye aye, cap’n.”I allowed her to take the lead, trailing behind just far enough for our hands to remain slackened. But as we turned, I stopped and caused our link to suddenly go taut.“Is something wrong?”
“Nah, sorry, don’t mind me,” I said. “I was just wondering what the flea market was going to look like. Is it just set up with a bunch of different booths or something?”
“Mhm! People claim spots by setting up carpets. Many of the merchants set up on top of them and lay out all their wares for the passersby to see. You’ll also see a whole bunch of different stalls,” she said. “The market is packed with an incredibly wide variety of items. Many of them are unusual, and you’d be hard-pressed to find anything even remotely similar elsewhere.”
“That sounds pretty neat.”
“It really is. There’s a mix of good and bad, and you get extremes on both ends,” she elaborated. “But I don’t think that’ll be a problem. Not for you, at least.”
“Heh, I see. I get it now.” I grinned, fiercely, and began to cackle. “So you have brought me here to showcase the extent of a Demon Lord’s power! Very well, I will use the full extent of my power over the art of appraisal to seek out diamonds in the rough, treasures in the dust, and bring them to light!”
“Mhm! I’m counting on you.”After taking a good long look at the bright smile on her face, and returning it, I raised my head and looked away from the adorable hero’s expression to glance in the direction of the man observing us. It seemed he had yet to take action, so I turned my gaze back to the wonderful woman by my side and continued to follow her lead.***Editor’s note (Joker): Hey, guys! Joker here. Sorry about the absence. Just dealing with irl stuff, as you know. A bit of an update for you all. My dad’s doing great. He’s off pretty much all the machines they had him on, even dialysis. He’s got a pacemaker in, and they’re now trying to stabilize his blood pressure so that they can move him to the rehabilitation area so that they can work on getting him strong enough to send home. Thanks so much for your well wishes and comments. They really helped me get through that rough patch. Didn’t mention this when I told you all about it, but only two days after my dad was admitted, we had to also put down our dog. So March wasn’t… really a good month. But thanks to everyone who helped me through it all. It means so much to me. *bows* See y’all in the next chapter.<– Prev — Next –>
